did you know that the university of Iowa's locker room is painted pink?
I hear it is an attempt to psych them out, imagine what the other team would think if they hear that
Maybe. I wonder what the visiting team's locker room is like? Do you know?
I think so!  I've heard of teams having heated benches for the visitors, but in the winter? I'm sure there are all kinds of things to bother the competition.  I have heard of Teams having heated Bench for the Visitors.
I hate a cold bench.  I don't know if I would like to be in a place that cold or watching football in it.  It's either one or the other.
I would watch it inside, somewhere warm.  I heard of the Georgia Tech-Cumberland game but I've never been there.  Have you?  Was that the Georgia tech-cumberlandGame in 1916?
I have.  What happened in that game?
Georgia tech defeated Cumberland by a score of 222-0, I think the whole thing.
That is insane, how did that happen?
I know right?  Do you know the highest scoring game in history?
I can't imagine that score. I would not watch that. It was too high. I am curious to know how many people left to get out and watch. I can see how it would be high but I can't even imagine thatscore.
I guess it depended on who was pulling for the team. The highest scoring game ever in college football was actually professional football. It's surprising that it was in 1916.
I would think you'd have to be really good in college to be good at that level.  I don't think I would want to be playing at thatlevel.
Good point.  There was a player who was a professional qb who never fumbled the ball once and never fumbles again.
I have heard of that, he is a Patriot player right?
It was Benjarvus Green Ellis. He was a running back.
Interesting. Do you know a lot about him?
I guess so. Do you ever watch ESPN by the way?
I do watch it on my Roku but I don't have regular cable. I have to pay extra for ESPN but I do not have to do that for my regular cable so why pay extra?
Have you ever watched Pokemon? It is winning an emmy right now
I used to watch Pokemon, it's funny, my sons used to play it when I would go to their neighborhood.  Now my sons are on their phones too much I don't watch it.
That is funny, Pokemon is pretty popular, there are over 750 episodes of it.  There are probably more than that, but I don't know.  It was nice chatting with you, have a great day!
What do you think of Keith Jacksons death
I think it's sad.  I think that so many people grew up hearing his voice.  So many people.
That is sad. He had a 16 year broadcasting carreer, so I can't imagine this number. But he must have had millions taking into account all those millions taking INTO account.
ya he was, do you use the phrase alot whoa? I know nellie used the phrase whoa
It's a good phrase, but it was a beer comercial!
I didn't. Did he retire from the ABC news?
Yeah he had a great voice but he was lured and decided to stay, he ended his carreer with a great Voice,
He did, he was a Marine, he must have been young when he was calling games, he is still young!
Wow this guy was just full with suprises,  he didnt only call football games though,  I wonder if he did pro basketball games too,  sports are so full with SUprises,
Yes he is crazy busy, he's also crazy busy when he's not on the tv. Did you know that Woody Hayes punched a clemson player once?
Yeah I heard about that,  he kept coming up with ways to get criticized for doing that.
Maybe he did.  He won an Emmy for that punch!
I didn't know he won the Emmy, did it happen in 1997?
Well apparently he did so much work by just calling the games, he was inducted into the sportscasters hall of fame, he is one of three to be inducted in there
Yeah he sure has a big resume its sad to think that the guy was only 55, his wife and children are left behind, he has 3 grandchildren, he was crying a lot, the guy had a big resumes its sad,
I know right! I also didn't know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team.
Nice from Snoop Dogg. I like that song, it's very nice of him.
Not really, I don't know what it is about.  Did you know that the highest paid among the US department of defense employees are the football coaches for the 3 service branch teams and the highest pay for the three highest paid for the service branch's teams is the head football coaches?
I wonder if that is a good salary or a bad coach.  I will have to google that later.  The inventor of basketball, the inventor of Basketball, didn't get a good salaries.
It seems like a sport that I would have to look into more.  I guess it is popular enough to be pretty much every sport in the world.  14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to American college football teams.
I love all sports!  The US Supreme Court building has a basketball court.  I didn't know that.
Hi.  Do you like basketball? I like to watch it and play it, but not so much to watch.  It is a team sport.
I watch it from time to time, I enjoy it, but I don't have a favorite player, do you have afavorite player?
I don't really have a favorite since Michael Jordan is my favorite since he is my best, but I do like the guy who invented the sport, the coach at the University of Kansas, the guy is the only losing coach at that university of Kansas
Go figure. I like Kareem Abdul-Jabaar too.
I heard he used to be really good at dunking, so much so that he was banned from college basketball for like ten years. It seems he used it so frequently that it got banned from College basketball for over ten years
Yeah so strange. Do you know what the NZ basketball team is called?
Yes that is the official name and it is referencing the nickname tall blacks
Yeah thats what they are called.
I wonder if the Supreme Court enjoys a game of basketball? Apparently the Supreme court enjoys a games of basketball. On the top floor of their building they shoot hoops on the highest court in the land called "the highest court" on the top of the top building they shooting hoops on.
That must be handy to play, or good for your work if you are good at it!
I had some friends growing up that were big basketball and footballs fans, but not friends growing in the 50's.  I know that in 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a coaches or a coach at the college level.  At the college, the coaches are the highest pay in most states.  That must be a big paid job!
I guess it pays quite a bit to be a coach.  I think the players are probably paid quite a little bit too.  Do you listen to the radio much or do you listen only to the coach?
Yes. I do. I like things that utilize radio waves. I think it's pretty crazy that the sound can be extracted and transformed over miles and be extracted into sound in ways that can be transformed into things that utilized by things that utilizes radio waves, pretty crazy.
It really is!  And you can even catch Jupiter's storms in AM and even turn them into AM!
Those are some strong storms! I wouldn't mind tuning into stations that only play U.S. artists.  I don't mind tuned into stations in Canada though, since they have to play 40% Canadian music by law.  Canadian music is 40% Canadians, so they have a lot of artists.
True! I didn't know soldiers used to make radios during WWII.
I remember seeing them make sound with a pencil and razorblade. How did they make sound?
What channels do you listen to?
I think in Europe you can pick up Finnish stations that have a news program in classical latin.  It's interesting.
I wonder what they have on in Latin?
Yes, it is, it has over 750 episodes, that is an interesting program.  I like to look online like classic radio dramas, they are still available online likeclassic radio dramas
Are you a football fan?
I am! I like it, how about you?
I watch some, I usually watch them on the Monday and Thursday night games, but not this season.
I know right, the game only has 11 minutes of action and i guess the rest is commercials, theres only 11 minutes in a game, i guess  the rest are commercials
That is crazy to think that in such a short amount of time, they have to drag it out to almost 3 hours, it seems like so much!
It definitely is.  I wonder how much milk it is worth, though.
Yes, and ESPN won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv.  That would be a good addition to watching games with.
Yeah that is a good addition.  Did you know that benjarvus green-ellis never fumbled once?  That is amazing.
That is an incredible stat!  Did you know that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an NFL or MLB player.  I think that is due to the longer careers and the average life earnings of engineer are higher than an NFL, MLB player due to longer careers.
Yeah, but NFL careers are usually pretty short on average due to injury, so it's hard to get money.  You'd think they'd get to the majors and stick there long enough for the money, but yeah, NFL careers do come pretty short, too.
Yes, I would think so. Did you know that the NFL has no written rule that prevents females from playing? I didn't even know the NFL had a written rule.
I think that is a stupid rule, they should start letting the Saint cheerleaders eat at the same restaurants as the players to try to boost ratings, and start letting The Saint cheerleader eat with the players, that is the best way to boost Ratings.
That is really kind of dumb.  That seems like a odd rule.  It's kind of stupid and also kind of odd, I think.
It is, cat are such amazing creatures, there is a cat that is the mayor in Alaska, I wonder what his name is
I used to work in a cat cafes. They are everywhere in Japan.
No, that would be a cool place to go, $1.50 per hour to play with cats and you get drinks.  I think I would pay that much just to play.
ya I agree! When a cat reaches the age of 15, it has spent 10 years sleeping, so when a cat reach's 15 it has actually spent 10 of those years sleeping!
That is a life well lived lol, cats can actually co-author physics papers too, so that is a way well lived
LOL, that is crazy!  I wonder how that's even possible?  I would like to see that work.  There is a town called Talkeetna in Alaska that has a cat named Stubbs as the mayor in the town called talkeetnas in alaska.  I think he is the only cat that has ever been mayor in that town.
That is really funny, I wonder if the cat ran against a dog?  If a dog was the candidate, would it be as funny?
Hahah!  I had a good time chatting with you!
Have a great day!  Thanks!
Hi, how are you?
I am well, how are you? Do you know who Keith Jackson is?
I hear he's really old.  I love college football and he's from there.  Not familiar with him though.  Whoa nelly!
I am, I call him the heisman, I'm a huge Michigan fan, he was memorable but he was a huge michigan fan too.
Nice! I feel like a lot of Michigan calls do as well.
yeah he was, but he retired now, and yeah the name of the Michigan marching band spelled out by keith, the Michigan Marching Band spelled out "keith"
That was a nice gesture. He is the voice of college football for the longest time and he is from Michigan so that is a nice gestures.
No, I never time attended but I'm a big fan!  Do you have a favorite player?
Who is your favorite player? who is your best of all time?
I would have to say Charles Woodson, he cemented his Heisman against Ohio when he was announcing that game, but I also like keith jackson and I think announcing thatgame was the best
Nice!  I remember getting stomped by Michigan many times when I was at Illinois - Woodson was always there to cheer me up by hitting the bars.
That's rough haha. I've seen some memorable games, including when Woody Hayes punched out the other player. I think the best player I ever saw from Keith Jackson was Park, though. He had a lot of memorable games too!
I know! He was criticized for that call, but he came back and clarified what he meant by "call".
He was inducted into the emmy's and the sportscasting halls of fame and will be inducted in the sportswasting halls
Yeah he has one of the most iconic voices, along with Costas, Musberger, and Michaels!
Those are great voices.  He is good for radio.
Yeah, they could get a ton of calls for that.  I was reading up on sports on the way over there, did you do any reading?
It is, especially in the Olympics!
I know. I think it takes guts for a country like Russia to call rowing "guts" during the cold war.
Wow, that is rocky.  I don't think he would do stuff like that again.
Yes!  Nice chatting!  Have a great day!
Have you heard of keith jackson?
Yes, he is the voice of college football on the broadcast of "The Voice"
Yes it was the Saturday afternoon broadcasts on ABC. He has had a long fulfilling life.
He did, I recall him covering a wide variety of sports for radio and television.  I can recall himCovering a wide range of sports.  He used to call the linemen guards.
He used a lot of funny terminology.  Whoa nellie, bantam rooster, etc.
Yes, he was a very funny and interesting man. Did you know that the University of Iowa painted their visiting football teams locker room pink? I thought it was because of the visiting teams but it was just because the University's painted the whole locker room blue.
Yeah, I think pink became popular for professional football players to support breast cancer.
Do you watch a lot of football?
I do.  It has grown in popularity.  In the 1960s, top bowlers made twice as much as football stars.
I'm not a big fan of football, but I love researching it because I read so much! I did know that the highest score in a football game in history was a score of 222 to 0, Georgia Tech vs. Cumberland. I wonder if the number was the highest ever in a game or a game? I love research and will look into that one day, I love football so much.
Wow. Wonder if that was the team that never fumbled the ball? That would not be the case if Benjarvus Green Ellis was on the team.
Green Ellis is a rare player.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, was so dominant with the dunk that he got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade.  He was a dominant dunker.  I wonder what Kareem abdul-Jabeur did to get the shot ban.
That's funny! I would love to watch play basketball on that court! I love to play in the surpeme court building-it called the "highest court in the land"
I wonder which teams usually play there?
Hmmm, it seems like the employees of the judges play in the building, but it is actually the employees and not the judges actually
I'm sure they do.  Do you know the inventor of basketball?
James Naismith.  He is the only losing coach in the University of Kansas's history.
Yes he is!  Do you know the New Zealand basketball team?
It's not like there are many famous college football or basketball coaches. In 39 states, the highest paid state employee is iether a famous college or basketball coach than the highest paying state employee in most states.
Well I got to go, nice talking to you.
It was nice talking to you too!
Hi, how are you?
I am well, thanks for asking. Did you know the NCAA basketball violations are so deep?
I think the NCAA is a little weak, but the findings have not been major sanctions, but it's been a long time to investigate, so it is difficult to say what the findings are, but I think there will be some major sanctions for a really long time.
I dont think so, but I think a lot of what is going on behind the scenes is much more serious.  A lot of the coaches and even the recruit's themselves admitted that they discussed how to bribe or "bribe" each other, like Arizona's coach Sean Miller who admitted he tried to recruit Andre Ayton.  He even tried to bribe Arizona's Coach Sean Miller to let him go.
Ayton's allegations were dismissed but the advent of sneaker companies acting as intermeidaries has complicted the investigation.
I feel bad for the kids. they make a lot of money. i dont feel bad. the kids that get a scholarship or a sre do what they feel are fairly compensated. i don't feel that the kids who get a college scholarship should be able to make a whole lot of $$$.
I agree. I can't imagine why these kids forgo their scholarship when they can make money off of it. It's ridiculous. I mean look at Sean Miller and what he did with the Ayton scandal and then what he's doing with the Sean Miller one. The FBI was even in Arizona trying to make sure they were'nt using him to make money. Imagine if they were in Arizona?
It's impossible.  A 18 year old kid gets offered money than a 18 year olds.  I mean the NCAA has no control over it.  It is just impossible.
I had no idea he had an offer, I wonder what he would have walked away from if he had known he would get that offer?
I would have done the same. It would have been hard.
Yeah and they break rules at a high level so they can be successful teams like Duke does, they can break rules and they are successful teams
It's crazy how in 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach. In 39 out 50 states it is either the highestpaid state employee or the college football/basketball coach. There's so much money in pro kids and pro money in college football too!
I know, right?  I didn't know that.
Football is a money maker for a lot of colleges, it is crazy how much it is a Money Maker!
Yeah that is a good thing.  It pays well for the model.  And I think it pays well even for lesser sports, like swimming and volleyball.  Good thing they have a good model.
Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the creation of the yellow first down line?
I did not know that.  I was shocked to find out that the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink.  That must be the locker roomFor the visiting football team.
That is crazy, and also crazy that in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much money as the top football stars,
The highest score in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0.
I wonder how long that game lasted.  With commercials interrupting it.  I wonder how many commercials that game had?
I think it lasted until the last one.  I was listening to Nuntii Latini, a weekly news programme conducted entirely in classical latin, and it lasted all the way through to 1992.  Do you know what that is?
There is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.
Hi, do you like cats?
Yeah, cats are cool.
No,but I have two friends who have one. They sleep a lot.
Apparently, sleeping for 20 years is the best living you can do apparently.
I believe it. That's a lot. Did you know that there is a town that has a cat that is mayor?
I did not know that.  That must be in Alaska!
Yes the town is Talkeetna, it is the major one, the cat is from there, I wonder if the town has a cat in the town
Wow. He must make a lot of executive decisions.
I guess he does, to be honest major.  He doesn't play with cats at the cafe so he probably doesn't.  But I would think he would know how to play with them.
Yeah, and the cat in the opening scene of the godfather 1 cat was the one from the god father
The cat was even named co-author of the book.
Yeah I did, the physicist actually.
I'm not sure.  Hey, do you like football?
I do, although I watched the superbowl a few weeks ago.  That was kind of boring, but it was a big game and I always like the big game.
Yes, it's better to have the rest one weekend before the season starts and then have some rest one after that.
yeah, well apparently Iowa paints their locker room pink for visiting teams
That is so funny, they must really want to intimidate the visitors
Yeah, sounds like it. I am surprised that this is allowed though.
I am too. I know things like that are not always the way they should be. I think it would be something if there was a rule that said it would not be possible for a woman to play in the NFL.
Wow, I did not know that. I wonder how many female players there are.
Yes, there have been some. Nice chatting with you. Take care.
The radio is a fascinating technology.
Good morning! Radio is great.
Cool. That would be such a stressful job. I would have thought I would want to live off the air.
I remember when I was in school for radio back in the times, we'd have teachers taking a shift in a Ohio school for Radio.  The earliest show I remember was one thing waking up to and the next thing waking to is one of the teachers doing the shift.  It was the early 90's and the radio was the way it was then.  I think they had a show that records and talk about radio back then.
wow..that is crazy!  Do you play any old radio dramas?  I used to like radio dramas.
Yes, I have.  That whole good and easy radio thing, pipe into a radio broadcast and sit back and just pipe into the TV.  No commercials, no shows, no one to talk to, just the radio broadcast.  It was a good way to get through the commercials and the radio news.
That would be neat, but it required thinking. I think broadcasts were the only ones that did that on the air.
I agree.  I think I would have been fun in the booth at the county fair where they broadcast a demolition derby.  A colleague had done some radio training and was able to broadcast a demolitions derby. I wonder if he was in a car with parts flying by and dodging other things.  That would have fun in a booth.
Demolition derbys are crazy but fun, I wonder if there is a sport that could be classified as one, demo derbys can take so much endurance to compete in, do you know what sport?
Yep, wow! I didn't know that. Dang, I can't believe that Keith Jackson passed away. He was a good sportscaster for ESPN and a really good sportswaster.
I knew he was, I'm not a huge sports person, so I didn't know that.
Yep, he's a really good announcer. He did the Saturday at ESPN. Keith Jackson was pretty well-known guy too.
Some announcers have had a career in sports. He started announcing in the 1970s.
He went to school for radio, so he was one of the guys I thought.  He was one in a lot of years, I think.  I think there are so many guys that go to school and then go onto sports talk professionally or are just announcer's for their football games.    I know the guy that is the best at the demolition derby is a announcer for the football games too lol his name is Keith Jackson, and he is one of that guys I've thought about going to school to be an announcer.  Do you ever go to a demolition derby?
lol. i got a demo of a slow game play. lots of talking and waiting and then no one really won. i would have liked the football. the demo was the slow game. LOL.
Heck, even though I had training in radio, I left radio when they taught me to use the microphone only to relay information to a audience, not just relay information over the microphone to someone. I was afraid of the whole "heck no" thing. I did some club dj'ing, but that's about it, I don't know what they taught us.
Is dj-ing as exciting as movies make it out to be?  I have never been able to experience it.  Except for the bar scene I feel like a lot of the annoying drunk people.  Not as exciting for me.  The bar scene i feel is where a lot happens.
I remember being in a club dj'ing in a person who was trying to clean up and hit on the radio for the clubs when I was 18.  I remember being disturbed and disturbed by the drunk stuff going on in clubs.  The person would do some ridiculing of the crowd and they would laugh and laugh.  They were pretty quick with quick comebacks and shout outs though if they were upset about something.
You have to be good with the microphone, and a bit biting and sarcastic, and wit it all, but good.
lol  I'm not an entertainer.  I used to do a few shows a few years ago, but I retired a few months ago.  My adrenaline and nervous energy is an asset to my job.  Someone once told me to make sure my nervousness doesn't get in the way of my job because mine is to make up for my time.  lol
You're right, they are thrill seekers these days.  They are always chasing that rush of adrenaline and are making new things just to attempt.  It's funny that you're making the same things we used to do, but we are thrillseekers these days!
do you watch the NFL?
I do actually. What about you?
Same here. Did you know women can play in the NFL?
Yes and with no limitations!
Nope as long as you qualify you are allowed to play
Nice. Did you hear they are placing tracking chips on the players now?
Nice.  What is the reason for that?
I think just collecting stuff like a bunch of other stuff like velocity and rotation.
Nice I hope they use that to make the game safer and also better
I hope so! I also hope that they can use the rocket scientist who is a coach who is also a rocket scientist.
I did not know that.  I wonder what his change of careers is.  Is it a good thing or a bad thing?
Matt Patricia. He graduated from high school with a degree in tons of math symbols. He also graduated with one in math, and it was all in math symbols!
Nice! Did you know Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink?
I wonder if that is supposed to have any effect on the players.
I think so. Bowlers used to make more than NFL players in the 60's.
Yeah I guess it was a more popular game back then, coaches were the highest paid people, and they are still the highest Paid now
Yeah no surprise there. Do you know the highest score in college football?
Hmmm, I did hear that it was a TD, it was in a giant stadium in Texas, right?
Yes, I know abut that stadium, the highest score is 222-0, Georgia Tech versus Cumberland.
Wow I wonder how they got that score.  I know the high school where that was in was high school and it had a stadium that could seat 18,000 people.  They must have done it to seat that many people.
Wow that is a lot of people, I bet it cost a lot,
For only $60 million!
Hi do you watch the NFL ?
Hi, yes I do. Do you have a favorite team?
I like the Patriots, did you know he never fumbled a ball in his career!
My husband is from the bay area so I like the Oakland Raiders, but I root for the Oakland raiders.
Nice.  It's cool.  Do you know the highest score ever recorded in a game?  It was 222 to 0.
222-0. I wonder how many of those there were
Yeah, that was a game that was played between three teams in 1916.
I am familiar with it. It was Georgia Tech and Cumberland. There are many different kinds of football in different parts of the world, I believe. I am sure there are many in the US.
Yeah I know a bunch of different kinds like soccer, rugby, football, canadian and australian football, and yeah there are tons of other different kinds
Soccer? football? My grandpa is a huge fan of all of them. He's originally from Hungary, so he is a big soccer fan.
Nice, good sport for sure. ESPN won an Emmy for it too
I had no idea! Did you know the university of Iowa's locker room is painted pink?
I think it's to intimidate the opposing team? I wonder how that works.
Do you watch basketball? I don't really watch it, do you?
I watch it sometimes.  I like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Did you know that his dunk shot was banned for a while until recently?
Lots of money in sports. In 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach.
Yeah it is, lots of people watch, that isn't a surprise I guess.  Do you know who invented the sport?
Yes that was James Naismith, interesting name, and also he's the only losing coach in the University of Kansas's history and the only one in their history to be a losing coach
Yeah that is pretty bizarre, also, I heard there is a court that is the highest basketball court in the land, pretty bizarre.
I have heard of it, I wonder where it is located?
Yeah it is on the top floor of the US supreme court building, I'm guessing it is in the top Floor of the building, yeah.
Yes I am also.  Do you have a favorite basketball team?
I don't have a favorite but I like to watch the games from time to time, what about you?
Hi. Do you watch football? Charles Snowden recently led the Cavaliers over louisville.
I am a football fan, I like to game depending on how well it is being played. The football is being Played all over the world now.
Yea, it is definitely different all over the world, I guess Snowden is a good player in basketball but not so much on the gridiron, I never saw him on the Gridiron,
That is strange, they require drastically different sports skills, and they play them in a strange way
Yea, I guess it would, but he played basketball for coach johnson at the college level so I guess he could play football for that matter
I am surprised that a good coach makes as much money as people tend to think he does.  I wonder why the difference in the world, a good one in the pros can make twice the difference, I would think that a coach in the pro world would have almost as much as a pro, I am surprised though.
I guess it must be stressful, recruiting players, getting to coach is very stressful, he's trying to rebuild his football program,
It must be stressful but lucrative for those sponsers if they go on to have good careers. I don't follow pros too much, I don's know who the highest rushing yards or biggest lineman has never fumbling the ball and who has the highest rusher with no fumbling.
Yea but coaching can be lucrative too, in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football players.
I think that's because they had a longer career and didn't have all the injuries that football players no matter where they went. Football has a longer life and more injuries that Football players no more.
Football is so popular that in the 60s individual bowlers probably made more money winning competitions than in football.
I feel bad for the players on teams that aren't good.  I can't fault them for being 13-3 in the Superbowl this year, but the record holding 222-0 is not my fault.
Yea 222-0 is pretty bad, I'm surprised that there was ever anything close to score or even close to scoring, especially considering what Georgia Tech did back in 1916
I expect scores like that at basketball games not football, I call them "basketball games" because I expect scores to get to a certain point and go up.
Yes, loopsided scores are what we need. I used to like basketball years ago, but Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was so dominant in college basketball that they banned the dunk for over a decade.
Yeah I don't really understand the love for the dunk. I think it's sort of cool, but not the skill level, I think the skill of the three pointers is much higher than the skill at the dunk, and yeah I'm not sure I can understand the Love for the Dunk.
I guess the dunk was pretty impressive when it used to reach the hoop at 18 feet. Now it's only at the 3-point line. I guess there are people who can do it.
True, but good vertical is important in basketball.  They need to lower the hoop in WNBA so that women are dunking at the same level so that they can get a good vertical.  I think that would be more true.  Do you think they will ever lower the hoops?
I think the hoop is lower than in the NBA, but the diameter is larger, like 5 feet 7 inches, not 4.25 inches. I am not pretty sure on exact stats, maybe the diameter of the hoop, but I know the diameter and diameter is smaller than the hoop at the NBA.
I don't know.  It depends on where in the world the games are located.  In America, it's more showmanship than game skills necessarily.  I think it's in the US more for showmanship and less for game skills.
LOL  I know right,  I like New Zealand,  they have a basketball team nicknamed "The Tall Blacks"  lol
That's a bit risky.  I wonder if it's because of the racial tensions there.  If it's bad enough they gave it a knickname like that, it would be a bit of a bad way to go out of your day.
Hi there! Football or basketball? Which is your favorite?
Football is the american version, it is more exciting than the American version.
I agree, I follow college football Americanano more, but do you follow college Football at all?
Yeah I do, it's so popular in the US that most of the biggest stadiums are college football
That is crazy big!  I heard that the University of Michigan has one of the largest, I heard it was the Iowa Hawkeyes.
I have not. I do know that the flags in stadiums are very large, they weigh in at 300 pounds and are known to weigh more than the flags
That's crazy heavy, they should put those on top of stadiums instead of using them. The hawkeyes painted their visitor locker room pink.
haha that is hilarious, did you know Snoop Dogg once wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team?
I would rather hear that lol.  Maybe on the radio!
Good question. Bing Crosby sounded very popular back in the 1940s so I don't know.
I don't know who Bing Crosby is.
He was a musician back in his prime, his recordings filled more than half of all radio time in the US in the 1970s, his recording recordings filled about a third of all days lol, so he was definitely a musician in his day, and probably a musicianBack in hisPrime
Wow!  I want to hear this guy!  In Canada they are required to play at least 40% canadian music,  I wonder why?
Yeah interesting law! I wonder why. They should probably play that station that translates solar activity into sound, they have a station that does that
I wonder if they did. There is a radio frequency that catches Jupiter's radio storms.
Cool, I wonder if it sounds like static or something? Bill Murray voiced the human torch in the 1970's fantastic four radio show.
That is amazing! I have seen him in that show, have you?
Yeah I bet so did some people. It was probably for entertainment, surprisingly! One of the top radio acts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist. That was hard to believe.
Lol, radio has come a long way, I wonder how long it will be on the radio? I think I might go to the free website and listen to dramas, there is a free website I like. It was great chatting!
Cool!  Yeah I like that too,  a Hanson song became a most requested song on an alt rock radio station lol.  I think it was "come together"  aanson song.  Have a good evening!
I love Hanson, lol.  Bye!
Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never had a fumble and is impressive.
I thought that was weird.  I wonder why cheerleaders arent allowed to eat at the same restaurants as the nfl players?  Weird that the cheerleaders aren't allowed.
Yeah, that is strange.  Also bizarre is that U of Iowa's visiting locker room is pink.
I wonder if it was meant to be mean or to demoralize the players?
I don't know, but I'm not sure it would work lol.
That is crazy, I was shocked that the highest score ever in a football game was 222 to 0. That is crazy
That is! I doubt it. It was in 1916 and the other team was shut out! It changed everything. In the 1960's bowlers used to make more than football players, no doubt.
I know!  Can you imagine if bowlers were paid more?  NFL players make average 6-12 million a year for bowling lol,  they make average of $32 million a week.  I would have gone for that!
That's nuts! I would have never guessed that. There is only 11 minutes of gameplay in an NFL game. That means that there is only one NFL game every 18 minutes.
Never knew that either. I would be frustrated if I knew how long a game was.
Yeah, the game takes forever and it is frustrating. I can't imagine trying to watch the super bowl right now. It's the last game of the year. The super bowl, and I can imagine it being frustrating.
I always thought that the cat in the opening scene of the Godfather 1 was a stray. I think that is pretty cool. There are few chances for an unplanned scene like that in the God Father. It was a cat.
I bet it wasn't! It's weird that there is a pay to play with cats, in Asia you can actually pay to plays with cats!
That seems like a waste of money LOL,  what do you do with a cat for $5?  That seems like too much money lol
I doubt it.  Do you like cats?
I think they are, they have even made mayors in some states including Alaska, they've made mayors of some of them,  weird lol
I know right! Do you know who the only co-author physics papers are?
That is pretty strange, I wonder what the actual purpose is behind it.
Yeah I know lol, apparently cats just sleep for two-thirds of their lives,  I wonder why?  Apparently cats justSleep for two thirds of their life?
Yea, cats are considered lazy lol I can't imagine sleeping for two years and not getting anything done. I wonder why cats areidered lazy?
I can't even imagine doing that.  Basically sleeping for 24 hours a day!
I'm not sure I would be pleased. I would think the sport players would be overpaid but I would faithfully do it if I were an engineer. After all an engineer has higher wages than an NFL or MLB player, even though they are not as well known or overpaid.
I agree. I think that in the revenue sense people don't pay them enough considering how unimportant their jobs are. I know they generate a ton of revenue through the tickets and merch but in the sense people can see how un important they are, it seems like a waste imo.
That seems like a hugh waste to me!  I think that any percentage of our earned income should automatically be going to funding projects or foundations that help our citizens lives or economy.  Instead it is funding projects that do not help our lives or Economy.
I agree.  It kills me that it is always billionaire owners that cry poor when they don't get paid and it is the taxes for their stadium.  I think it is mostly billionaire owners who don't care about the taxes or the taxpayers.
Hi, how are you?
Hey there! I am well. The game of basketball is quite common, with 4 player teams and 5 players in one player teams.
I do quite a bit, some guys win.
Yeah.  We were down by 3 points at the end of regulation play and only two field goals at the start of overtime and then 3 field goals in overtime to get the points.  I'm glad my team wasn't tired.  It was worth it though.
Good job! The New Zealand team is nicknamed the "tall blacks" the way the US team is the " tall blacks".
No I didn't know that! I just remembered that Shaq didn't make a 3 point shot in his entire basketball career and he never recorded a 3 pointer. I'm bummed that I couldn't make one of my 3 point shots today, and he only recorded 1 in his whole entire career!
I know, youll never know! I would love to see a game on the supreme court, they have a bball court on the top floor, and it is a bbq court on their top floor!
Everyone loves basketball.  I like to watch basketball when I can.  vasectomy rates actually increase during March Madness.  Men stay home for a few days and watch basketball. That is pretty extreme.  Vasectomy rates increase during march madness.
That is absolutely hilarious! Apparently, in college baskeball and football coaches make bank.  College baske ball and football Coach's make bank!
Yeah, they start out playing for the service branch teams and then start going on to become football coaches.  Did you know that the highest paid among all department of defense employees are the five highest paid of all the service branches of the department of Defense employees.
I wonder which are the highest paid state employees. I know they are the 2nd highest paid in the US!
Football involves way too much money for me, especially in Texas. In Allen, Texas, a high school football stadium cost $60 million to build and it seats 18,000 people. I think that's too much, especially for high school Football!
It's funny how Iowaas locker room for visitors in painted in a pink.
I have never heard that.  I think it is a joke.  The world's largest 14 college stadiums belong to American college football teams.  14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong  to American football teams!
That's wild!  Do you know the highest score of a football game ever was 222 to 0.  It was in 1916.
That reminded me of a Snoop Dogg song he wrote. "Fight, Fight!"  He wrote that for his high school football team, and it was heard on the radio waves.
Radio waves are fascinating. I would like to hear jupiters radio storms, apparently you can hear them on AM radio!
Wow. I wonder what they are like. There is even a radio station that translates solar activity into sound and you can listen live to the sun's music.
Do you think it's better than the regular am radio?
haha yes, I thought so! A Hanson song became the most requested track on a Chicago alt-rock radio station because the djs didn't reveal the band, the station was so sneaky! A hanson song is the most requests track? I wonder who thought of that haha
That's really something. I wonder what it is?
Did you ever listen to Hanson? One of the most popular radio acts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist, who baffled contemporary critics.
Interesting! Nice chatting with you!
Hi, do you like football?
I do like football. I was reading that the NFL has no written rule against female players. However, women would not be allowed to join unless they met the league's eligibility requirements. Did you know that the women in the NFL have not been allowed to play since the league does not have a written rule Against female players?
Yep, that is true. It wouldn't surprise me. I know how big the guys are so it wouldn't be a surprise if a woman or two joined or wanted to join a team haha.
I agree, but I think it is semi-related. I heard that the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink. I wonder why, do you think it's for visiting teams or if it's just for the University itself?
Yeah that is great! I wonder if it helps decrease team moral haha.
Yes, it can definitely get a team angry.  They make too much money to not make it.  In the 1960s, top bowlers made more than top football stars.
That is weird to hear, I know its a big difference in physicalness but still, that is weird.
Absolutely. I think football pays better now a days. In 1916 Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0. The highest score in a game is in bowling too. That is how much football pays off these days.
Yeah that is crazy to hear, how did the game continue?
Sounds like a world record loss and win, pretty interesting,
Wow, yeah that was a wqas pretty embarrasing!
Do you have a pet cat?
Yes I have had cats.  How about you?
Nice! I have two cats too, but they are stray, too. One of them was a stray that was found on set of the Godfather movie, and I hope they gave the cat a good home after filming. I've never seen the movie, but I hope it's a good one!
That was sweet to hear.  I wonder if the cat had a cameo apearance?
Wow!  What a fun fact!  A cat reaches 15 years old and has spent 10 years of its lives sleeping!  I wonder when that cat reaches that old?
Yeah, that is one long cat nap!
Absolutely!  I live in the US and there are cat cafes n Japan and Taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cat and have drinks.  I would like to try the cat cafes.
Oh, Japan! I want to see those too,l have never been there, have you?
I would love to visit Japan!  It seems like a neat culture, and I find their food interesting.  I find that I like the US to be more different, but I would love the same.  You?
Yeah, it would be a great experience!  Well, I gotta go.  It was nice chatting with you!  Gotta go have a great day!
Nice chatting with you!  Have a great day too!  Goodbye and have a great Day!
bye!  Have a great one!
Good morning!  Do you like football?
Good morning, Yes, I do.
Yes I do. The highest score ever in a game was 222-0.
I heard about it, that is considered unsportsmanlike conduct, that would not happen today.  Who is your favorite team?
I think college teams have advanced, I like the college game and the score but college teams do have better skills nowadays, all teams have skills nowadays and the college team is better than the college one
Do you have a favorite team? I like the Patriots myself, do you?
I like the professional teams, but I've added the Chiefs to my list of favorites to be honest. I like watching Patrick Mahomes this past season and I like the way he's going.
Cool!  The new england patriots have been pretty mainstream and rookie has been on the losing side, but he was pretty mainstream too.  lol  I would like to see him win and not be on the lost side like the losing team is the new englands patriots...
Speaking of the Patriots, it's depressing when one of their teams loses.  I've never heard of Benjarvus Green-Ellis.  Do you know who he is?  It seems like the patriots have been around since 1960!
I have not. Is that the Patriots running back?
Yeah, I heard that he never fumbled the ball in his entire career.  That's impressive!
That is really impressive. I can only imagine the pressure he must have felt to remain perfect.
I thought he had the ball all the time and that the announcers probably mentioned it all the way through.  I don't think I could have done that.
I wonder how Kareem abdul jabbar felt any pressure about dunking the basketball in college. He was so laser focused on it. His eyes got really messed up when he was dunking.
Hmm, I guess I can see that.  I would have expected it to be different.
He was so good at it that he got it banned from college basketball for over a decade.  He could dunk the ball so well that the game was so banned from watching him on the game.
I did watch the women's big four championship game last night, and I'm pretty good at it.  I'm glad the dunk shot is no longer banned, I'm sure it would have been pretty good.
Awesome!  That's so awesome!  I watch it occasionally.  I find it ironic that James Naismith invented the game of basketball and is the only losing coach in the University of Kansas's history.  He was the only coach in their history who invented the shot and also the only lose coach in U of K's history!
That is odd.  I wonder if he ever had a game inside him?
Maybe he has rewritten the rules to favor his team. Have you heard of the basketball court that is on the top floor of the US Supreme CourtBuilding? I heard it is the basketballcourt that is in the court that's on the very top floor.
I did not know that, that is a sign of how far it has gone. Anyways, it was nice chatting with you, have a great day!
Hello, do you watch football?
Yes I do. Did you know Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink?
I think that is supposed to have an effect on the opposing team, right?
I wonder that too.  Did you know that in the 60s bowlers made more than football players?  I think it was about $7,500 to $8,000.  I wonder how much football players make now
I guess football was not that popular back in the day, or at least not as popular back then as it is now.
Yes that's true. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
Yes that is 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland
Yeah that was way back in 1916, I wonder how the score was after that
Yeah. Did you know ESPN won an emmy?
Yes for the superimposed yellow line
Yeah that was for that too, it was easier to watch the game at home, and they did a good job with it
True. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
Yes he is the one who never fumbled the ball in his career
Yeah. Did you know women can play for the NFL?
Yea and there is no rule against it as long as they qualify
I wonder how many minutes of play that is since the game average is just 18 minutes ofPlay
Yeah. Engineers make more in a lifetime than all football players over the lifetime though
They have longer careers so more time to make money.
True. Did you hear about the rule for New Orleans cheerleaders?
Yes they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players
Yeah, that is sexist and really?
Hi, how are you?
Hello, I'm good!  Do you follow football?  Gridiron is a family of sports that includes rugby, gridiron, soccer and sometimes football.
I love all types of football! How about you?
Yea I enjoy gridiron football, and I love to play it. Rugby football is pretty interesting too.
It's interesting that the word "football" is understood to refer to whichever form of football is most popular in a regional context. It's called soccer in certain areas of the US, but it's understood to mean "football." In other parts of the U.S., it's called "soccer" and is understood of course to refer only to soccer, but in other areas, it's known as football and is most often understood to referring to whichever forms of football are most popular.
Yea, soccer is also known as rugby as well as other football variation types besides American football
I don't know, I wonder if there are any other ones too.
I would think they would make more.  The average engineer makes more in a lifetime than the average NFL player.  I wonder how much money other footballers make?  Theaverage engineer makes less than theAverage NFL player does in a year, but the average engineer is still making more than the money other player makes in a month.
True soccer players make pretty good bank, but I think most players makepretty good bank.
Yes.  I wonder how soccer players are tracked.  The NFL embeds chips into shoulder pads and footballs to track things like velocity and location.  Do you think soccer players do the same?
I guess they do,  but I wonder where they get the places to place a tracker?  Unlike the NFL players who don't have shin guards or shoes,  lol  Where do they get places to put a tracker for those?
I guess so, funny how the NFL tracks everything.  I wonder how the stats are on that.  An average game only has 11 minutes of gameplay, but the NFL track's all the stats in an average game.
I know, right? The last Super Bowl I watched it was in the Super Bowl and it felt like it was 3 hourslong, that was so long!!
Yea, that is excruciating to watch! Do you have a favorite NFL team?
I like the New England Patriots, but they're not as much as the Goat who are the New York Patriots
Yea the Patriots are a great team, apparently Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his career, that's a great one
that is an impressive feat. I cant imagine the stress and pressure to remain perfect at it.lol
Yea that's pretty tough. Probably tougher than the last time Georgia Tech scored 105 points on Cumberland back in 1916.
Sounds like a train wreck.  I wonder if that would happen today.  On a different note, the eagles once set the record for the lowest scoring Super Bowl.  That sounds like it would be wild behavior.  The Eagles once set a record for highest scoring Superbowl.  What a train train wreck that would be.
lol I am not surprised.  They get a really bad reputation from their fans in Philli, lol.  I wonder if they have an actual court inside the stadium.
That is funny!  Well it's been nice chatting with you this morning.  I need to go walk my dog now, talk to you later, friend.  It's been fun talking to you!
hi, do you like football?
I sure do. Did you know that U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink?
I wonder if that was supposed to have some effect or not
Maybe so. Bowlers used to make more than NFL players in the 60s though.
I guess football wasn't that popular back then so I guess football was more popular then
True, did you know the highest score in college football is 222 to 0
Yes that was 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland
Yeah that was back in 1916 and that game was the best ever
Yeah. ESPN once won an emmy for their superimposed yellow line
Nice. Did you know women can play too?
Yes and there is no written rule that prevents them from doing so, they just have to be old enough to try out, no rule that prohibits them
Yeah if they meet the requirements they are good to go
yeah. Did you know the average gameplay is only 11 minutes and 17 seconds?
true, but we are glued to the tv for hours on end.
Yeah, engineers make more than the players over the lifetime, but players only make about as much as engineers do
I guess that is because of longer careers, adds up, but still, still.
True. Did you hear about the new rule for Saints cheerleaders?
Yes they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players
yeah and worse if they have to leave mid meal and have to walk in
Yes and that is so sexist
I agree.  Things have changed since then, but still need to.  It was nice chatting with you.
Do you follow the NFL?
I do, I am ready to watch the playoff games now.
Who are you rooting for? I am rooting for the Saints!
Absolutely!  I am into Patriots.
I am rooting for the Patriots.  I did not know that Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating at restaurants containing NFL players.
Yeah, it seems a bit hypocritical, I wonder why the NFL would do that, if their team is the only team, why would they have a rule like that? Seems a bit like the NFL.
That is sexist!  Speaking of the Patriots, did you know Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled once in his career for the patriots?
I did not, I saw him fumble a couple of weeks ago. I wonder why he didn't fumble?
Yes he recently retired a year ago, but he's been impressive in the playoffs. On a different note did you know the Patriots were in the NFL a while ago, they recently retired.
The season has wrapped up and they are about to hit the playoffs and I think they will win the super bowl this year. It seems like it has been about 20 years since they win the Super Bowl, but they have not won it in the last 20 years.
Well I think the bears have a chance, I think that the Saints will make a run, but I don't know.
I'm worried about the last year of Brees and Brady. I don't follow them at all. I would like to find a young QB that can do well.
Patrick Mahomes is killing it, he is having a great season and will be a good role model for others.  He is a star in his own way, and is having another great season too.
I am loving watching that kid! I think the NFL needs more young QBs!
Do you follow college football?
I do a bit, at the college level I try to follow Ohio State, but I am no secret fan of the Chiefs so I follow them a bit more. I am a secret fan at the chiefs.
I'm an Iowa fan, too. I can't believe they painted their opponent's locker room pink.
Yeah I saw pics online of that, it's a bit ridiculous.
Well good chatting with you, this was fast and informative.  I'm a psychology graduate and used to be a coach years ago.  A psychology graduate, too!  Good chatting with a coach!
Same to you, you too!
bye!  Go Patriots!
Good evening partner!  Do you like watching American football or rugby?
I like football and dont like rugby or gaelic football, the nomal version of it, but I dont like Rugby or g Gaelic football.
Similar at the same levels, there was a high school team that played with the science building burning down in the background and they were the only high schoolteam that played. It was a science building Burning Down, I wonder what was going on in the building.
The most expensive high school stadium in Texas was the one that cost 60 million to build, and it cost them $60 million.
Wow, what a huge cost.  In Philly, they need a court setup for the stadium.  The fans need to behave in that stadium and not behave in the court setup.
I know right, that is strange.
I wonder why?  Do they do that to keep fans bad behavior down?
I guess that makes sense since there is no court in the moment. College football teams are also trails in the world at the moment, but I guess that Makes sense. 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums are for college football teams.
Wow, that is impressive.  Tim Tebow was big in college football by Kiss and was offered to play arena football by KISS.  He went to the NFL instead.  Wow, I wonder why.  Did you know that Tim Tebows was big enough in college that he was offered the chance to play in the NFL by the NFL?
I know there are great college players dissapoint in the NFL, like Tim Bow but yeah, not many great college player dissapointment.
It must be tough to make it.  I wonder if someday a female will play, there is no written rule against it.
There is a female NFL league, that would be great, I think there is a Female NFL,
Yeah, it would be very interesting.  On average an NFL game only lasts 11 minutes and 17 seconds.  Did you know that?
11 minutes? that is a scam.  I wonder if those huge flags in the stadiums are a scam too?  They are for huge flags.
Yeah, they are huge. I wonder if they are the ones that have pink locker rooms like the University of Iowa?
Yeah I bet that is funny.  They weight a lot.  Flafs cost $20,000 and they weight about 100lbs.
Wow interesting. The average lifetime earnings of an engineer make more than that of an NFL player.
It kind of makes sense that the engineers get to have larger carreers since they are engineers, but it kind of Makes sense.
Yeah they can get injured and can get really injured.
It is sad that so many football players end up with brain damage because of the injuries and also because of all the injuries they get, it is sad.
I saw the movie Concussion, it is very insightful, I think the movie concussion. It was lovely speaking with you today, you were very insightful. Enjoy the weekend!
It really showed the reality of the hidden reality of that game.  Thank you for the chat, it was a great one and showed thereality of the game. I hope you have a great weekend too.  Bye.
Hello, are you into the NFL? I'm wondering when women are finally going to be able to play in the NFL.
I think the NFL had a womens' league years ago, but I don't know.
It was a league with lingerie? What is that? Is that on the side football? I don't know. I think there's a league for that. I wonder what the name is. It's not a league that's for lingerie is it?
I think so.  Good for them!  I wonder if a woman would ever be allowed to play in the NFL?  I mean a woman could be allowed, but I don't know if I would be good at it.
Women can play some positions like kicker and punter because size is not an issue.  But male cheerleaders have always had an issue, and they have always been male cheerleading.
I know a male friend that was a cheerleader in high school and I think he was very athletic but I don't think he did great at it. Cheerleading must be hard.
I have heard that the Saints cheerleaders don't eat in the same restaurant as the players. I wonder how dat is possible, they can't eat at the same place as theplayers, but they can eat in same restaurant with the players?
Wow, I heard that cheerleaders have a lot of strict rules, I think football players have a whole lot of rules too, and they follow them, there must be a lot a lot
Yes, they have rules about drug use. I think that is about it. I know that they have some rules about standing for the national anthem.
Haha, I heard that! That's crazy! I also heard that the football coaches for the Department of Defense and the military teams get paid more than football coaches get paid by the US government. That is crazy!
Yes, I know that's way past the players, but they probably have to market themselves to the market.  I think that's why engineers make so much money off their careers than pro athletes.  You know, I've heard that in the US Engineers make twice as much money over their careers as pro athletes and stuff.
Engineers have it easy. No injuries, no injuries. A lot more years to end a career. They can put in a lot more jobs.
Yeah, but engineers are needed more and more, so it's screwy that they are not priorities in society and not the priorities in Society.  Engineers are needed but not the person who is the best football player, or the best fantasy football player.
I played for a high school team that was the Panthers and then I played for one that sells cars.  They spend a lot of money on these schools and colleges, but the priorities are different.  Football is more important than academics.  I think the schools should have priorities for the kids that go to the college, because they spend a whole lot of time there.  The high school I went to, they were the worst, but I was able to get into a school that was better.  It was a highschool that was more important to me, since it sold cars and not football.
I think you should play high school if you are a good athlete, get a scholarship if you can and be a good student if you want to get an education if you cant be a very good athlete.
I heard about the high school stadium in texas that cost $60 million. I wonder how they are doing. It's a high school Stadium in Texas that cost about $60 Million.
Well, if the stadium is payed for by books, that's the money.  I heard that a high school team kept playing a game because the textbooks on the field were on fire.  How much money is that?
I heard that as well!  Some of the world's largest stadiums belong to college football teams.  I heard that in 39 of 50 states, the state taxes for the stadiums are from the schools.  Some 29 of the 50 largest stadiums belongs to college teams in this country.  That's a lot.
Lots of people love the sport and more jobs are created.
That is true.  I didn't grow up playing but I did grow up played on a few school teams and then on a club team.  It's not like the European soccer system where you go pro.  You go from club to pro.
Yeah, that is true.  There would be so much confusion about the purpose of school and what the purpose is of the school.  Yeah, that would be a useful confusion.
Well, I enjoyed talking about football with you over dinner.  I think I'll go now.  Enjoyed talking about Football with you.
Same here, have a great one!
Hi, how are you? What do you think about Redskins quarterback Alex Smith this year? I know Chris Thompson is a key player for them, he's the QB who is also the grandson of the Redskins quarterback Alexander Smith
Yeah, I heard his health has improved a lot.
He came back to Florida State and worked out at Florida State, his fractured fibula ending the 2017 season was really bad, so he had to get back to work, but he did well.
I'm sure he's finding his groove again now, though he is a little nervous getting back on the field.
I'm glad he reports it felt good for him and that he is able to make playes again.
Well after his initial injury he was out 2-3 months so I'm sure he feels like he hasn't been out for a few months.
Did you hear that top bowlers in the 1960s made twice as much as top football stars?
I did not know that, very interesting, I think its crazy our nation is so into football these days, so crazy
The highest score in a football game ever was a whopping 222-0!  That's embarrassing.
I wonder what happened.  I don't know much about football, but it doesn't interest me much since the average NFL game I love only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  The average NFLgame has only 11 minutes.
The NFL uses tracking chips in shoulder pads to record moves and footballs to track velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.  They also use tracking chips  in shoulder bags to record Moves and footballing to track Velocity, Ball speed and Location.
Yeah, football is such a sport and apparently they are developing all the important technology for the sport. Espn won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line for the first down line in football.
The eagles had a temporary court set up in their stadium for 6 years due to their fans bad behavior.  You have to watch your behavior!
Funny.  People can get prohibited from doing that in women's sports.  The NFL has no eligibility requirements for women in the NFL.  They can play if they meet eligibility requirements.
I think that's awesome! They should be playing! They can show their skills someday! Did you hear about that high school football team that burned down the science building? They burned down a science building! I'm surprised there wasn't a separate building for the high school's football team!
Interesting. I heard it coming while I was watching the Superbowl. Have you heard it? I was still watching the superbowl.
I will, and I hope the Eagles make it. They are set up on the court!
I watch football sometimes, I usually watch the superbowl, the suspense is exciting.
It's fun. Good food and friends. Commercials are fun too! I like to visit the locker room at University of Iowa haha. I like the good food and I get to check out the pink pink locker room for visiting teams to check in and visit.
Hey, I don't like pink, I think that's a bad color, but I know a lot of football players wear it to show support for breast cancer fighters and survivors.
True, but Kiss bought into an arena football team and offered a contract to Tim Tebow, so he's going to be a QB.  Nice chatting with you!  Kiss bought in to an arena basketball team and offering a contract To Tim Tebows QB!
Hello, do you watch the NFL?
I do, how about you?  Do you know the NFL has 30 teams?
I think there are 30 teams divided between NFC and AFC, how many are in the NFL?
Yes. Did you know women can play as well?
Yeah, they have no written rule against them playing and if they qualify they can, but there is no written way to qualify
Yeah pretty neat. Did you know there is only 11 minutes of active play during a game?
Yeah that is so short, I know I can't keep glued to the tv for that long watching the game, its way too long watching.
Yes, I know. Engineers make more over their lifetime than they do.
I'm not surprised, they have longer careers so more time to make money, and more time
Yeah true. Did you hear about the rule for New Orleans cheerleaders?
Yeah and they cannot eat in the same place as the players, or eat in same place with the players
Yeah and worst is they have to leave mid meal if they walk in
Yeah I know, that is sexist and they should be banished, what a sexist name for them
I hope it is gone soon. Did you know they are putting tracking chips on the players now?
Yeah they are and they track velocity and speed and all that stuff, I believe.
Yeah I hope they use those stats to make the games a bit safer for everyone
I hope so too. U of Iowa painted their visitor's locker room pink.
Hmm, I wonder why that is. Bowlers used to make more than football players in the 1960's.
Yeah, that is crazy. ESPN won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow line, that was it.
Yeah that was great for them, really made watching the game from home much easier.
True. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
Hi.  I was unaware that in the 1960's top bowlers in the US made twice as much as top football stars.
Yea, I guess it's unrealistic for top bowlers to make that much when football players had regular jobs while they were playing.
Yeah that is crazy, but ESPN won an Emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line that represents the first down marker.  Yeah, it's just the line, but I wonder why ESPN won one for the superimplementation of that line thatrepresent the first downs marker.
That's funny, I thought it was as simple as putting a yellow line, but as long as it has been there for so long, it's funny.
The fact that the technology did not exist at the time, or at least did not yet exist at that time.
It's funny, but I think it's because now all sports have so many tracking chips embedded in their player equipment.
Interesting, I don't know if I like that concept, I wonder why they did it.
Yea, it's neat how they measure things like the ball speed, rotation, rotation. location, velocity, velocity and how they can measure things
Crazy that the University of Iowa locker room is painted pink.
That is crazy, I wonder what color the locker rooms are, I know that an arena football team Kiss bought one in 2001 and it is white, I think they have a football team kiss bought it
That's a great question.  I would have to look it up later.  It was all black and white before TV.
Probably.  I wonder why Tim Tebow never signed with the 49ers?
I don't blame him, to be honest. I think he was overrated.
Yea, he's not as good as Benjarvus Green-Ellis who was great, but he made so much more in his career. He never fumbled once in his whole career.
Funny you mention that.  An average NFL game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay.  I am surprised that there is that much.  Did you know that there are only 11 Minutes in an average NFL Game?
I'm not surprised that it's only 11 minutes, but the time they spend between plays setting up for the next plays is surprising.  I think that's the only time they've spend between play, and that's about the whole time they're on the field between playsSetting the whole game up for a play.
Yeah, I know. I like watching a game but it seems like that stuff takes up quite a bit of the time running the clock and then watching a video of the game and then the timeRunning the clock again.
It's funny how grueling the game is, I think they go through 16 games a year and only 11 mins of gameplay, its funny how Grueling theGame can be for the body,
Yeah, I remember reading about that, players have to sit in a tub full of ice after a game or something, I think.  I remember that.  They can't sit in the tub full.
Yep, it is a rough sport. The Eagles have a court room in their stadium that is like a court.
I wonder who has the head for that?
I think the eagles are in the stadium.  I remember a stand up comedian talked about it in the court of the stadium, but not sure where.
Yeah, and the average NFL player makes less than an engineer in their life, an engineer.  An average nfl player makes more than an average engineer.
Do you like to watch football?
Yes, I do. I'm interested to see how Jordan Reed is doing after surgery. He had a promising career, but he has to step away from it all after surgery, which is a step down from a promising Career.
Do you know if his team has done well or not so well lately?
I like the Redskins and I like Jordan Reed, what about you?
Did you know that the highest score was 222-0 when a football game occurred in 1916.
I heard about that.  I didn't know at the time.  In the 60s, bowlers were the most popular bowlers.  Half of all the money football players made was in the 50's, but I wonder how much money football is now.
Yeah, I am in fact surprised by that. I am sure a lot more now.
I was surprised to learn that ESPN won an Emmy for creating that yellow first down line graphic on television.  I wonder who they get to win those Hollywood awards for that?
I did not either. I don't know how a sport program could win an emmy for best acting skill and not for acting skill.
I guess the whole yellow line thing was so innovative for American football media coverage that it was considered worthy of the award.  I guess the yellow line is really innovative for american football media, but I'm not sure what it means and why it would be considered worthy.
I concur.  Btw, Patriot's running back benjarvus green-ellis never fumbled the footall during his career.
I did not know that.  That is impressive.  I did know that the NFL tracking chips are in his shoulder pad to record his speed and velocity and stuff.
I don't know but I think they have, they have all that technology
Good point. Too bad that football players that are talented only make half as much as engineers, engineers who are as talented only made half as Much as football players
I think that is because of the quick money and fame.
Yeah, it sounds like a bit of a bit.  You can't control your life like they do for athletes.  I mean NFL New Orleans Saints cheerleaders have strict rules about eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player and they can't be in the room with the other athletes. Sounds like they have rules for the NFL New New Orleans saints cheerleaders too.
The NFL does not have a written rule against female players but if they meet the requirements they would not be allowed to play. I wonder if they would be allowed. There is no written ruleagainst female players.
Wow, I didn't know that.  The NFL actually treats women better than the cheerleaders get treated apparently.  I wonder how the players and the cheerleader get treated?
I believe it!  Btw, nice chatting with you!  Happy Holiday's!
Merry Christmas!  Here is a fun fact, the University of Iowa locker room provided for visiting football players is completely painted pink.
Thanks!  I wonder why they did that?
I thought it was funny, both teams are good sports, but it is funny.
Hello, do you like college foot ball?
Yeah I used to watch it but I don't watch as much now.  Do you?
I love to, I watch it all the time, who is your favorite team?
I do not. Did you know U of Iowa's visiting locker room is painted pink?
I'm an Illinois fan. I have heard rumors about that. I wonder how that works. Is it just to cheer up the Illinois fan? Do they cheer in the locker room?
I'm not sure but I'm sure they won't make me made of it.
I don't care for it, I am more laid back or passive. I wouldn't care if I was beat 222-0 and had to go to a team meeting after.
LOL.  Thank god we're not Cumberland, we'd probably get our butts kicked on the bus ride home or something and be screaming or dead silent.  We'd probably be like, "thank god we don't have a bus ride to go home on..." lol
I heard that they took a beating!  That school should have been closed and they should have just closed it down.
Yeah that sounds like it lol. Did you hear that espn won an award?
No I didn't, what is that? I know they won a lot of them.
They won because of the superimposed yellow line.
I feel like the yellow line is a low bar to hurdle, but I like it.
I think it was just simpler than that and it made life watching the game much better.
Yes, tennis uses computers and sensors. I was surprised that they had guys measuring everything, like in the NFL, like chains, guys measuring the ball, tennis use it too.
Apparently they are spending all that money on tracking chips.
Yes, and also trying to speed up play by using them in footballs to figure out how to speed them up
Maybe.  There is only 11 minutes of live game play in a game.  So, that is very little.
Yes it's all commercials and chain gang time.
I like the chains!  lol  It's funny that an new orleans cheerleader thought it was funny how they were treated when they were eating at a restaurant and a player from the chains came in.  They were treated like first class citizens.  I wonder why they were not treated better.  Maybe it was because they were in a different restaurant than the New Orleans cheerleader?
I know! sexism is everywhere. Nice chatting with you!
Hi!  Are you a big redskins fan?
I am a Vikings fan, ha-ha Clinton Dix and Alex Smith as players. Ha-ha
I am a patriots fan, but a fourth round pick for Dix was definitely smart. They didn't give up much to get a fourthround pick for her.
Dix is a good player and good for defense.  I am a saints fan and don't like how they treat their cheerleards, but he is a very good player.
I think the rule about not being able to eat with players is really odd. I wonder why that rule was ever around?
I feel that is really sexist but then again, how would you feel about the other teams?
I'm pretty sure it's just because the NFL is a private business.  Kind of like the US.
Good point.  lol  I hear they also use tracking chips in the shoulder pads.  I wonder if that is what they use for the tracking chips they have in the shoulders.
Yes, it tracks there speed, lines and other tracks there Speed.
Yea it tracks all the movement and all the data that they get, pretty interesting, and it was created by engineers making the big bucks, they do all the best data
Funny, the average engineer has higher lifetimes earnings than the average NFL player.
Wow, I was dreaming about playing for my favorite college team and becoming an engineer before the NFL lol.  I was going to say my favorite team is the NFL LOL!
I like the University of Iowa.  What about you?
That would be my alma mater too.  Did you hear about those locker rooms they use in the locker rooms?
I heard they are all pink, to help breast cancer.
True, it does make sense. It is a calming method, a psychology of the color soothes and makes you relaxed. It's like when visitors come, color soothe and makes it all make sense to them.
Wow!  That's some serious level stuff!  Patriots running back Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled a ball!  Never!
That's a good feat, I feel like most running backs would like to fumble the ball, he should teach a clinic to other running backs, I wonder how he did it?
What's even crazier is that an average NFL game only lasts 11 minutes, but the average NFLgame is only 11 minutes and 17 seconds!
That is a lot of time lol,  it would take a game from start to finish to be 3 hours lol that is a whole game from starts to finish,  thats a lot,  a lot more time lol
It was great chatting with you!
I hope your night is awesome!
Do you follow the NFL?
I don't really. I'm not much of a football expert. I kind of like it, but I'm passing on being an expert.
I am not an expert, I don't follow it, but I do watch it when I can and I will watch it for my favorite teams games. What's your favorite teams?
Who are your favorite NFL teams? I know that the 49ers are a good one, but I don't know if I would have any other favorite NFL team.
I think the Packers have been good this season, but it looks like the Packers are not going to be good this year so that is a bummer. What about you?
I live in North East Ohio. We have the Browns, so we're fans of the Browns. I'd gladly swap the Packers records with the Browns! I'd also gladly swap The Packers records for the Browns if I had to.
Yeah the Browns have had some tough times lately. I don't like watching them. They are having a season like this right now.
I guess so. It could have been worse for them I guess. I heard about a team that lost 222-0. I don't know who was hurt but I think it was the team that's lost 222+0 before, I have not heard about it.
Sounds awful, I wonder how the game ended. Was it Cumberland fans in the stands?
I don't know, I'm sure they were pushing the limit for the whole week, and they were not going back for that one. I guess you have to stick it to a team through thick and thin, though, so I guess they were probably just going to stick with their team through Thick and Thin
yeah, but you have to stay a fan, but a true fan can't be critical of the management. I think that is where the test for a true fans is the critical "how much do you want to stay?"
I think a true fan would be the Eagles, they ended up having a court set up in their stadium for a court for a true user of the court set for a fan, in Europe they call those type of fans the ultras.
Yeah I've heard a bit about the Ultras in European leagues, but I'm not sure what they are. I've never been to South America, but am a big fan of international football, so yeah, I've been to the UltrAS in European league, but not so much here in America.
Football is such an amateur sport.  It amazes me that college football isn't as big as professional football, but college football is twice the size.  What amazes us is that it is such a small sport in a sport that is almost as big, but so much more.
Very true, but the size of the stadiums for college and even high school football is insane.
One of my teachers is a high school football coach, and a minor celebrity.  He was the only high school quarterback and only had one other player on his high school team.  I think he was one of the best quarterbacks in his school.
Yeah, and yeah, the highest paid people in most states are college coaches too.
A football coach would be a high cost for me. I feel like I could send two kids through college one day, but I feel I can't do it all. I would like to be able to put a portion of the high cost of college on my kids like a football coach, but not all at once.
Yeah its pretty crazy how much it costs to attend college these days.
I kind of like how career earnings are better for football players than for engineer.  I mean, look at their career earnings!
True.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good day.  I have to go as well.  It was nice chatting with you.
Are you a fan of football?
I am a fan.  Are you?
I did watch thesuper bowl this past sunday
I did, I was rooting for the Patriots, it was a close one, the game was really defensive for the patriots, but it was very close
Yeah, it was a really exciting game, low scoring but still really low scoring.  I was partial to the defense.  They make up for the patriots domination over the years with defense. I am impressed with the league's defense. They make the best defenses in the league and have been for decades.
There was a great player called Benjarvus Green Ellis who is from the patriots and he was in the Superbowl, but the fewest points scored in a superbowl was by a greatplayer called BenJarvusGreen Ellis
Yeah, I kow about that. He never had a fumble in his entire career and that is impressive, I think he only had one fumble in all of his career!
Very impressive, I bet it is.  Not many players have accomplished that.  ESPN won an Emmy for the creation of the first down line!  I can't believe ESPN won a Emmy for that!
Yeah, that is an interesting fact, I remember watching games on that and that was where they put that yellow line on the tv.
I think the yellow line has been around a long time, it definetely contributed to the game, it deserved to get an Emmy for sure, it has defineteley contributed to a lot of the game and it was well deserved
Yeah it has totally changed how we watch and cheer, and it has also totally changed way we watch it too. It makes all the difference, it makes it so much better and it changed how people want to watch and cheered as well.
I guess there was one team that lost by 222 points, but there were games with the same team that loss 3 times. It seems unfair to me.
Yeah, that is crazy! I wonder if it was because of the defense playing that day?
I don't know but I know that the team was blind and they didn't want to get injured or anything.  Another interesting fact is that bowlers made more than football players back in the 60s, but now the other way around.  I wonder why?
Yeah I thought that was pretty wild, I guess I would have never had a chance to be a pro bowler if I had had the chance to do that, pretty wild!
Good for you!  I guess it's a safer sport now.  Football has proven to have a lot of brain damage in players, but I guess that's why we say it's not a safer game.  It's not the only sport that has brain damage.
yeah, I did watch the movie Concussion. It makes you think about how much damage the sport does to the body and brain. Smith, Smith, did you see it?
I have not seen that film but I will google it later after I see it on Netflix, Ive never been to the orlans saints, they have some crazy rules, sexist and rude in fact, I think I will Google it after seeing that film, they seem like a really sexist team, they must have some really crazy rules!
Yeah that rule is really outdated and dumb.  I wonder what the actual rule is?  I think that's just outdated and smart.
I would sue the team if the rule weren't abolished, especially if it was for cheerleaders.
Yeah I would have to agree with you there.  Yeah, well it has been nice talking with you today.  I hope you have a good day.
Hello! Are you an NFL fan?
I am, what about you?
Yeah I enjoy watching the NFL.  I think that the teams are ok.  Do you know how many teams are in it?
I think so too, that's surprising!  My favorite team is the 49ers, but the NFL has gained in popularity.  Did you know that in the 1960's the top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars?
I like the Titans. I think the quarterback is out with injury.
I hear that.  I guess he's not in the football?  Can you believe that football has only 11 minutes of live gameplay?
Yes, I can believe it. I would think that they would have more than 11 minutes if action was on. The super bowl is going on coming up soon..the last one is coming up Soon.
I hear it is the first Sunday in February.  I will be there with friends to socialize and get some friends to Socialize.
It is my birthday too!  Football is too bad we don't have the highest scoring football game.  In 1916 georgia teach beat cumberland 222 to 0!   The game was so bad that it had both offense and defensive, it was the highest score in football ever.
Wow that is interesting, it's probably because of technology now a days in football and the technology we have
Yes, you're right. and all the graphics on television.
I heard ESPN won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line
I bet that was brilliant. Did you know that women can play in the NFL? I wonder if women can actually play?
I read somewhere that they can, but sadly no women have been able to meet requirements yet, if they meet requirements.
That's nuts.. If a Saint's cheerleader is eating in a restaurant and a football player shows up, they are not allowed to eat there.  They have to leave if a football players shows up and the cheerleader has to leave because the cheerleaders is eating.  That's nuts.
That is really unfair. Why would cheerleaders have to leave if the players are there? I wonder.
Yes, it is extremely sexist and it needs to go.
It is! It is!
I don't know.  I think that the rule comes about for a good reason.
It's probably all just not cracked yet. Did you know that an engineer actually makes more in a lifetime than a football player?
I think the bodies of a football player get really banged up, too.
Hi, do you follow the NFL?
I love the NFL!  Do you?
I follow it, I usually watch around the playoffs and if the playoffs, I follow.  Who's your favorite team?
Mine is the Bengals, my favorite team, what is yours?
Nice, I was a packer fan but now I am a Bengals fan. I saw them play against the Bengals in tecmo super bowl 2 for the first time.
I love tecmo super bowl too. I didn't know that U of Iowa painted the opposing teams locker room pink, I wonder if opposing teams think they are doing something haha.
Yeah I heard about that,  I bet they are overly pc lol.  I wonder who gave the final OK for that,
LOL  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top NFL stars.  I wonder if they were better?  In 1960 top bowlERS made twice what top NFL players made.
That is crazy, it just shows you how much bigger the NFL has gotten and how much better it is now.
I agree, Bowlers used to make quite a lot these days but not as much now, they make more than the bowlers, I think.
They probably don't these days,  but it must be pretty sweet to make a living throwing those balls!  Lots of women too LOL  It must be really pretty sweet  to make an living throwing them.
Thats pretty awesome.  Gotta love the attention too.  lol.
Yeah, and lots of high life beer and a thin crust frozen pizza.  Lots of highlife beer and Greasy hands with the greasy hands.
LOL. The highest score ever in a football game was 222-0.
Holy crap!  I read that somewhere!  Cumberland!  lol
Yea, too bad. Green-Ellis never once fumbled the football in his entire NFL career, he never fumbled once!
That is impressive.  He only had 17 total carries though.
I don't know but I would imagine a lot, he was a starter and had a lot of carries, so I would Imagine a lot
Yeah thats true, he had a decent amount of them.
Did you know that the NFL has no written rule against women playing?
I think it would be super cool if a female player made a roster and got some real gametime. It was so nice chatting with you today! Have you ever seen a female play?
Hello, do you watch the NFL?
I used to watch it a few years ago, but I am not current with it. How about you?
Yes, I do like it, I like it a little. Which teams are your favorite?
I like Green Bay Packers, back when they were the NFC. I wonder where they rank these days. The National Football league used to consist of only the NFL and the AFC but now it consist of the NFC and the NFC, so where do you rank them in the national football league?
Yep, I'm a Vikings fan, so my thoughts are the Saints.
I don't watch them, really.  I'm aware of them though.  Did you know that they plan to put tracking chips in player padding and in footballs?
I do not like that.  It's kind of sexist that the cheerleaders are eating at a restaurant and if they come in the players have to leave, but when the cheerleader comes into the restaurant they have to get up and leave!  Kind of sexist.
Do you like football?  I like football better than Australia rugby.  I don't know if you have ever seen them.
Yes, it is brutal! The actual gameplay lasts longer than 11 minutes in the NFLs, which is brutal.
Maybe not.  More commercials I guess.  Hard to believe a high school in Allen Texas was still a highschool in Allen texas.
I don't know about that school.  What is it?
It is a high school in allen Texas that seats 1,000 ppl and cost $100 million to build, its a highschool
Wow, I had heard that a while ago, seems like a waste of tax payer money.  Who's your favorite college team?
I have watched pro when I had the chance.
I would have to say the Iowa Hawkeye's fan's want to paint the visiting locker room pink.
Haha that would just make me mad if I were them. I feel like if you win you get to start getting the tracking chips and become pro. Thats how I feel about the tracking in the tracking Chips
I think they are supposed to calm them down lol. I've heard that it has made my engineers who make more money than nfl players over the lifetime.
Yeah, I would give it a try, but I wonder how long a regular season really is. I think it only lasts about 10-15, but it could be 40-50, so maybe 40- 50 is too long a season.
I dont think it is that long, how long is it?
I think it's 16 weeks and they play 16 games a season, each team has a bye week where the other team gets a byeweek so they don't play each other,
Nice talking to you!  It was nice talking to You!
Hi turker!  Are you a fan of NFL or do you watch Thursday night football?
I'm not a fan, but I do like Thursday nights.  It's withou that sacred sport.
I feel the same way and hope nothing change with regards to thursday night football, I hope nothing else does.
The Thursday packages isnt very good thin, but Disney is the owner of ABC and ESPN so the Thursday packages are not going anywhere.
I had no idea, I know Disney owns them, I think they recently brought ABC and ESPN under the same channel, I like Disney better though
Yeah, they're buying up all of those channels now a days, they even own Star Wars, Marvel, and DC.
Wow, Disney's doing good for themselves! I knew they were small for a few years, but not that good! The Disney channel is my favorite channel, and I think I've had it since I was small and had it for years.
ya it is a great channel, crazy how much money TV moves can be, they get $12 million for Thursday night games, so thats some money football moves
Wow it's amazing.  ESPN is laying off large numbers of workers though.
no I didnt know that,  thats terrible,  have you ever watched the bing bang theory?
I have not.  I don't really like those things because they are older.
NBC has great series, "That 70s Show" was a great series with an average of 137 million viewers and it was a very funny show
I read that it has viewers.  I wonder how many women get a chance to play in the nfl since they can meet eligibility.  Women would have to be able to play at least until they are over 55.
I didnt know about the rule, I would watch a woman in the NFL but I dont think I can watch a man in the nfl because of that rule
I think the NFL would have to change the entire paste of the game, they cannot tackle women head on, even though they are not 100 lbs menwould be able to change that the entirepaste of the whole game, how can they tackle Women's head on when they are 100 lbs.
Yeah I dont think so either, I think it would be a good sport to mix genres though.  Do you know who Matt Patricia is?
He is the ideal for the NFL. He is the best.
I think she does, she is a coach in the NFL and her name is Matt Patricia and she's a male lol.  I think she is also a rocket scientist, I think her name was the best coach in ever and he was a rocket scientists
Wow! How would you feel if you had a chance to see it without knowing it? How would You feel? I would be embarrassed if I read it and didn't know. I would definitely not want to see that knowing that I had a Chance!
I think he might have been an honest mistake, he is a smart guy.  I wonder if the girls didn't worry about him because he was a rocket scientist and all.  Patricia, he said she was a rockets scientist.
I never would have thought that. I think it would be a woman. Did you know that an NFL game has only 11 minutes of live playtime? I wonder why there is only 11.5 minutes of play time for an NFL player.
I did not know that. I'm kind of tired of only 11 minutes of live playtime in a night though. It's getting late, I think I'll call it a night.
Have a good night!  Nice chatting with you.
Haha I think its weird that the name Minnie Mouse is actually short for Minerva.
I had no clue, I did know that Disney was founded by roy disney, though!
Yes I did.  Wall-e was named after Walter Elias Disney, Walt Disney's son.  I did not know that.  Did you know that Wall-E was named After Walter Elias disney?
I guess he is, I guess there is a lot of obscure Disney stuff like hidden Mickey Mouse images.
Haha I think I remember reading somewhere that they put hidden images in the Disney movie Flubber. I think Bill Nye has a blog or Youtube channel that showcases a lot of that, I wonder if he's any good haha, I think it's the one where he does Bill NYE, he has a Youtube channel That's a good way to put hidden pictures.
I know right, why did they put Bill Nye in a movie like that lol? Is it scientifically accurate? Is the movie even scientifically accurate at all?
haha ya I think that would have improved the movie, but Robin Williams was a real stinker as the Big Hero 6, he was the best, I don't think he would have been Robin Williams, that would of been a real Stinker for sure haha
Big Hero 6? I haven't seen it. Apparently it takes a 55,000 core computer to render a 16-bit computer. I wonder how much toys they can sell for that? I know Big Hero 6 didn't sell very well.
I was wondering what it was about, I thought the movie was okay but I'm a little biased because I like the older Disney animated movies better, I like all the classics better than the newer stuff, I'm biased though, I liked the older classics more than the new ones, so I'm not sure why I thought it was better, do you like Disney animated movie ?
I think there are a lot better movies out there. I think they are making movies better than the new one.
It has a long history.  Do you watch football at all?  I personally really care about watching the Superbowl, but I don't personally really cares for the teams.
Yea, I follow football and all of the teams, it is hard to keep up with all the teams. I like the giants.
I agree with you on that. I think it's kind of boring, too. Apparently there's only an average of 11 minutes of actual gameplay in an NFL game, and apparently there is only 11 minutes and 17 seconds of actual game play in an average NFL game.
That is crazy!  On average we have 1630 games a season and only 11 minutes of gameplay on an average.
Yup, it's like the Superbowl this year. There was a lot of actual gameplay, but not a lot, there was lots of commercials, lots of watching men standing still waiting to hike the ball haha, and lots ofwatching men standing in a line waiting to hiking the ball.
Lots of injuries and stats. Did you know players have chips embedded in their shoulder pads?
Weird! They are tracking all kinds of stats and I wonder if that is in the videogame at some point?  I know that the average engineer makes more in a lifetime than an average nfl player.  But the average Engineer makes more at some points.  Maybe they are tracking that too, or just tracking all sorts of stats in the game.
I guess football careers are very short, in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as football starts lol,
That is funny because today it is a complete reverse. If a female NFL player can actually meet the requirements to be a female player in their lifetime, it would be crazy to see a female nfl player.
Yea there are no rules against female players, theres a place kicker, so maybe.
I was thinking that too!  She is a massive woman.. I think she could be a kicker, or maybe a linebacker or something like that.  I think they will never stop her, so I think it is probably a no stop. haha
Did you know that Disney owns ABC, ESPN, and ESPN?
I didn't know that. Do you like to watch football?
I do, I'm a contributor to the number one ranking for viewership of Sunday night football.
I watch Thursday night football.  Do you?
yeah me either. Do you have a favorite sports team?
I like the redskins!
I like the Dallas Cowboys and where I grew up, they are the Cowboys. Luckily the cheerleaders for them aren't treated the same way as the saints cheerleaders who are forbidden from eating at the same restaurants as the NFL players.
Interesting, apparently the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
Super short! I find myself devoting most of my afternoon or evening to watching the game.  I know some of the players are in real good shape so they are technically not down.  They can still play if need be.
Yeah, and it is only 11 minutes, so I can see that.
Yeah but it takes so much time to play those expensive ads, and the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an NFL player, so I think the engineer gets more money, and they have more time to plays, while the NFL player doesn't.
Yeah but I think engineers make good money in other places too.
I imagine petroleum engineers make a lot of money too.  I wonder if female players will ever be playing in the NFL.  There are no rules against female players and there are no written rules against them playing.
Yeah I think I saw some female players in my high school in the 90's, but I think it was in HS or high school.
Wow, they must meet the physical requirements. I wonder if females share the same locker rooms as the males and if the females share some of the locker rooms too.
I think so.  There was only one player who was a wide receiver in my school.
Football?  I don't know much about football.  I do watch a lot of disney movies though.  Did you ever see Wall-E?  That was one of my favorite of the new animations by Pixar.  Do you watch a a lot  of disy movies?
I watched some good Disney movies the other day! Minni is short for Minerva, right?
I wonder how common that is. I wonder how many people named their own pet after the character. I know I don't have any pet names, but they are common.
Yeah I wonder about that. Apparently Bill Nye was a consultant for flubber too.
I never realized he was a consultant, I was watching it and never realized that.  Bill Nye got his big break as an entertainer because he was watching that.
I miss football season!  I love ESPN's Monday night football offerings.  Boy, I love Monday Night Football!
I inadvertently end up watching Thursday night football too!
It is hard to believe that the first prime-time NFL game on the major broadcast networks was in 1932. It was a ABC/ESPN.  It is hard for me to catch up during the football season, but it is part of it.  The first prime time NFL game ever was the first ever on all the major TV networks, and it was on ABC/ABC.
I did not. I heard Disney owns ABC and ESPN, but also CBS and NBC, and I heard they were bidding on the CBS/NBC football package in the 90s. I also heard DisneyOwns Disney owns CBS, but not ABC.
That seems like a smart investment.  In 2015, the top 3 single telecasts were NFL games, including the Super Bowl, number 1.  I wonder if any of the top 5 single telecasting were NFL game?
I think ABC tried to make it more accessible to more people when they moved to ESPN in 2010, but the prime time NFL still was on ABC.  Then they moved it to ESPN.
I think ESPN is laying off large numbers of workers, but I'm sure it's sore that the NFL is laying of more and more workers. I don't like the idea of thursday games, but it's the Sunday game of the Seahawks. Richard Sherman of the Seahawks plays in the SUNDAY game, and NFL players don't want to be sore for a Sunday game, especially since they have to go to work!
Haha, that makes sense, I think my body was still sore from the color run last week, I'm not very athletic so that makes me sore, haha.
Can't imagine how sore you are. I'm sure that's a pain. An average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay. Can you imagine how tired you would be after an average NFLgame with only 11 minutes and 17 seconds of liveGameplay?
Well, part of the reason football is not a lot of live gameplay is that it doesn't interest me. I'm a bit of an interest, so I lost a little bit of my interest. ESPN won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line for the reasonFootball. ESPN lost because they superimposedyellow first down Line for the TV.
I think that is well deserved, but hey, I love cartoons, and Disney is a cartoonish so it probably helped them, especially Disney.
Yes!  My favorite character is Minnie, I like Minerva too.  Did you know her full name is Minna?
That's a clever name. Wall-e was named after a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney.
Haha, I figured that was what it was. It's cute that the wall was named after him, haha. Have you found any hidden mickey mouse images in any of the Disney films? I know that I have seen the wall and the little mouse, but never found anyHidden mickey Mouse images
I think I was clued into that subculture recently with my company founding. We have had a lot of catching up to do on our company's founding a few months back on October 3, 2012 and I'm sure I've seen some hidden images, but I don't know.
Yeah, that would be a reason to rewatch it! Big Hero 6 was made on a 55,000 core supercomputer!
Technology has come a long way. Bill Nye was the science consultant for Flubber and he was the first to ever use it.
They have grown so much! They have theme parks aroud the world, I think.
I guess they got their start in animation and then branch out into theme parks. I guess they want to branch into a live action film, sort of like the NFL.
Yeah, I bet their merchandise is a big part of that, I would love to collect some of it!
I forgot they also have merchandise.  Minnie Mouse, NFL crossover dolls, merchandise.
I feel like I have a bit of a time to clean up after myself! haha! Speaking of that, I was thinking about the NFL Potato Head and how I feel about that...haha!  I'm speaking of which...there are some of those!
Good morning! Hope your day is going well!
Hi, how are you doing today? I am catching a movie with you today?
I am working today so I am not looking forward to it.  It's just a little fun to waste a little relaxation.  I am looking forward for the weekend and maybe Sunday watching football.  Too bad football season is over and we have a bad footballSeason again.  But, it is fun to spend a Sunday watching Football.
I agree, too bad I have a job and can't go, internet sounds good!  I want to catch a Disney movie, I think I'll try to see ralph and the patriots, the rams have been around a long time, too.  I like ralph, he was a ralph in the first job I ever had.
Yep, the Patriots are amazing! They did a good job and did a really good job, I am a fan of their team, I wont be a fan again, they did run away with it, yep, I loved the movie too. I like Disney, I think my kids saw Wreck it Ralph. Have you seen that one?
The risks of football are a bit high but I think they are the key to the risks of Football.  I am glad Disney is a key to that.  It makes movie-making well worth it.  The Patriots have been around forever.  Did you know they have a whole line of merchandise for the Patriots?  I think the hype for the Disneyland and the Disneyland merchandise is a bit High.
I think the merch will last forever but I think the movies are starting to rehash the classics.  The Disney movies are going to last forever.  It's proven that they can win with the merch, but I can't blame them for trying.  I think Bill Bilichek, Tom Brady, and Bill Bilichick will win again.
Yikes!  Apparently, football games have been heimleched to be better watching.  They have tracking chips embedded in shoulder pads and the tv's, and it gives great shots of plays and everything.  I think I'll be watching some more football games now.  Did you know there are tracking chips in the shoulder pads now?  Yikes!
I have heard of the tracking chips in the pads.  They put a chip in the players in the end zone.  It breaks the plain old "breaking the plain" of the ball into the endzone.  I wonder if that was in the commercial you mention.
It was on during the super bowl and cracked the back of the end zone in the Super Bowl.  It's funny that the guy recovered it and went back to work.  He wanted the car to get back to his work. I think that the commercial is a good idea, the guy recover it, but it took a bit.  I think the end of the field is a really good idea.
I guess I tuned in for the commercials, but the Game of squares was terrible.
Sounds like you were not a big fan of that! Here's a funny fact, the average engineer makes more than the average pro football player.  I think that's because engineering is safer, but the average Pro Football player doesn't.
The average guy in the NFL only has an average career of 5-6 years and in the Superstars make a ton, so it doesn't surprise me that the average guy doesn't make as much as they do, but the superstars make more over the course of their career than the average career.
I think people like to watch folks play ball because it's a way of going to watch people play.  Back to Disney, it seems that the political controversies in the past have not helped the sport.  The Patriots owner is a man with many political controversies.  He's the Patriots owner, right?
That is shocking. I heard about it on the radio. The massage parlor thing. I think that the Isle of Dogs will win an oscar. It's the best oscar ever! I think Ralph breaks the Internet.
That sounds like a really fun movie, with kids ages 8 and up. It had some moments that were dark for me, but I can see kids like that.  Speaking of movie salaries, there is a fun fact about football and bowler salaries.  Did you know that in the 1960s a professional football or bowler made twice as much as an NFL player?  That sounds like something I should have known, considering my kids ages.  I think the movie was The Incredibles 2.
I just realized my kids like Incredibles 2.  I've never seen it.  Pro bowlers make more money than the top professional athletes and they are superstars.  The revenue revenue from movies has started rolling in and popularity is what started it all.  Do you think that the top athletes will ever make that much money, or will they just be celebrities or become professional bowlers?  I don't know if the money will keep rolling in for them.  Kids like IncREDIENTS 2, but not all kids like incredibles 2 movies.
I'm sure a lot, but it's probably not a whole lot!  Fun fact...the highest scoring game ever was when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222 to 0.  Ouch!  Poor coach, he got no love from his players or his poor coach...fun fact...but Georgia Tech's defeated Cumberlands 222 to 1!
Talk about a blow out game I bet! Cumberland folded it program after that game, I wonder why?
I bet the coach changed careers, and didn't carry that over to his resume.  I guess it's a turn around for sure.  He didn't turn out so well.  That's true.  Hope that is true for him.  Well, lets wrap this up and wrap up this.  Have a good day!
I think so, great chatting with you too and have a great day!
Hello. How long have you been following the Roseanne reboot?
I heard it did not. I think it did.
I think the original show was kind of good. Pretty much just showed middle class, mostly in California, and it showed that not all of that is unusual in the day and age.
It showed real struggles, that didnt happen in the UK.  Thats why I like it.
I suppose the unreal part of your comment is right.  I would have loved to see the show if it was a reboot like the one with Sara Silverman.  Loved her in the reboot and I suppose the Unreal part is why she is now gone.
I think it is just the way that it is now, in my opinion. They need to be more careful in the public eye, and state their own opinion.
Rolandne, on the show was a Trump supporter, and her portrayal of Trump and his supporters was unreal. Her and her sister were both Trump supporters.
I think the portrayal caused some problems, but I do like how they treated politics as irrelevant, I watch them and I heard that they treatedpolitics as irrelevant.
I know.  I think that is a Hollywood buzzword.  It makes one's argument irrelevant.  South Park is another show that has been known as the leader in irrelevance.  They aired a spoof of Family Guy, "The Leader in Irrelevant" when South Park was on, which made the argument irrelevant too.  So, they are not far off from the leader of "Invisibility" with that show.
lol, you're right, it is irrelevant..they made the flowers from the simpsons crew for it lol
I don't remember the episode of Simpsons where Bart wasn't mentioned. Do you remember the one?
Honestly I dont even recall that one.  I dont know,  I cant recall that episode.  Honestly I dont Even recall it being about that,
I think it is because some ideas are repeating themselves. Like there are so many episodes of pokeman, it's like how many years are there? There's over 750 episodes of Pokeman, that's about 50 a year, so it's probably best to just end a show a few times over the years.
Yeah I think they did that years ago, lol.
I always wondered who narrated Thomas the Tank Engine.  That must have been a nice relaxing show with no troublesome trucks or even troublesome trucks.  I wonder who narrated it.
I think it was Ringo Star and Alec Baldwin but I've only seen a few episodes so I might recognize some voices from other episodes.
I think I do know George Carlin.  I know his last words were "You know what I mean."
I love Carlins explanation of the word "word". It means parts of speech.
I know Carlin is a classic thing.  The 3 horizontal lines for menu items are called a hamburger icon.  That is a really classic thing, it has been around for years.  I suppose it has to do with computers, they use them a lot.  A lot of them have 3 horizontal line for menuitems.
Yeah I think he would like it yeah, I think they should call it a menu button.  I dont know about the hamburger though,  I just dont see the need to call it that.
Hamburgers!  I have no relation to the joy, or the novelty.  Constant novelty from clicking links cause addiction.  Did you know that clicking links causes addiction, and that there is no relation?
How do you feel about internet and TV these days?
I think it is a part of the world, it is used for communication purpose, so it is good to see what is happening in the world.  But it is not good that it is being used for every communication purpose.
People can become addicted to clicking links on the internet, the constant novelty of the internet can cause people to become addicted.
Yes, we all suffer from it. Did you know online shopping is biggest revenue to the companies through internet.
Interesting how the internet falls under the library of Alexandria.  It has a saved copy of the internet in case it ever falls down.  The library of alexandria has a copy of every medium of the Internet in case something happens to it.
I have no idea. What do you think?
It is pretty big to save a copy of the Internet. Google had to do that yesterday for the 25th anniversary of it's invention as the internet is getting too big to saved it.
Yes, it was. In recent years, mobile internet connectivity played an important in access the Internet, especially the smartphone play a very important role in this.
Wireless internet still blows my mind.  The way it works is crazy.  I mean, there is 3g cell service at the top of Mount Everest and there is wireless internet at the very top of mount everest.
That's interesting.  Internet is the most important communication service for many.  Now days postal service is reduced due to it.  Email is the only way to get email since the internet.
That is a bad thing ultimately, it is a good thing though, it keeps a lot of jobs that people are not interested in, like mail carrier, nowadays we don't need the paper so thats a good things, a mail carrier still has a lot to do nowadays,
I don't know. I think people stopped reading newspaper. I mean, if you're ordering food from internet, ordering from internet is the main way to get it.  I think that's why people stopped read newspaper and now are simply using app to get food and sharing their data.  If you read the newspaper, you would have to take the staff with you when you went out with your friends.  That's not very useful.  The staff could just be your data.
Interesting.  Everything is different these days.  Things are easy because everyone carries phones.
Television is a massmedium for advertising and entertainment. It earns largest revenue through Ads and it earns largest money through TV as a mass medium for advertising.
I am not affected by netflix these days.  Are you affected by Netflix?
I think because of the size and technology of television there are a lot of different serial that are famous for a large number of fans and also because of size and Technology of television after second world war only black and white television is available for a lot.
Surprisingly enough there are a lot of long running shows. There are over 750 episodes of pokemon. That's a lot. I wonder how many episodes of that there are now. Did you know there are over 300 episodes of Pokemon?
I did not, I used to like Pokemon when I was kids, but it was in early stage of its development when I had kids.  I know that LCD (lcd) was a very heavy cathode tube that had to be replaced by the flat panel technology that was used for development.
Yes, TV has changed a lot these days. I remember having a giant heavy TV growing up and now it is flat and light.
Yes, they are composed of multiple internal circuits include the Turner for receiving the decoder for broadcast signals and then the TV is composed of several internal circuits, which include the turner for receiving and sending the digital technology.
True I remember that, converter boxes were a big seller, do you watch any TV show? I know that 70s show is still a big sellers.
I did, when I got a chance.  Well, it was nice chatting with you.  Have a great day!
Nice chat, I had a good day too. You have a good one as well.
You as well! Thanks!
Bye!  Thanks!
The president is a title for the head of the government, the title comes from the head and not a name.
That is true. They are called different things in different places, though.
In Finland everyone has the rights to an internet connection
That is interesting.  I wonder why they want everyone to have internet access.  Is it really free or do they want them to be able to use it?
I don't think it is.  Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration.
That's interesting! Nice chatting with you! Bye now!
bye!  Thanks!  See ya!
Have a nice day!  I will.
I want Alex Smith back.  I want him back in locker room.  More importantly I want the Redskins to get a new field dont you think?
Alex Smith was a great asset for them at the time but I think he is not the same.  I feel for people who need time and I think Alex Smith was not a great Asset.
It is a shame he's having the same troubles as Griffin though, uncanny,
He was in the league a long time. He gave the game a try.
I didnt know he did that,  I wonder if his teammates were able to appreciate him for it.
Yes he is a true professional.
Smith and his leg was a gruesome injury. Griffin did not make it back on the field after the gruesome injury to him.
I think he might be back, thankfully he can avoid crazy injuries. Did you know NFL uses tracking chips to help track players moves?
I think so too. He also has a masters degree in his education.
Yeah he is really smart having earned his degree so quickly.
He could have stuck to professional gaming.  Baker Mayfield is better at football.
I was confused as to why the saints cheerleaders cant eat in the same restaurantas the players? I think that is an absurd rule, why can't they eat in restaurantasThe players?
I think that is proof of the hypocrisy of nfl and all its rules and all of its rules.
It's hard to find proof like that, but there is.
I can't believe it's playoff time again, and the season has wrapped up for the year, and it's only a six week season!
Yes it is, the NFC and AFC champs are now the Superbowl in Feb.
I am not sure since there are only 11 minutes of actual gameplay no matter who plays, so I am not too sure.
What year is that?  I think it's the same year.
Did you know that the NFL has never had a female in the NFL?
I think we could, we are raising the first female nfl player so to speak, there are no rules against it, so I am not sure what the rules are
I hope it is a woman.  I would hope it would be a field goal kicker, or maybe a field goals.
Hey there did you watch the reboot of Roseanne?
Hello there, I did watch the reboot, was it a good reboot, and did you like it?
I thought it was good, I liked the original. I thought it had more laughs than the original and I didn't like the new one. Do you know who the president is in the original?
I think he has an orange complexion.
Apparently, he does. There was a president in Zimbabwe called president banana,
I wonder how many fans would follow him around? Maybe he could do a musical number for them and get a new musical number out of it?
Haha yes they could! And they make a lot of money off of it, Trump would be one of the top three richest presidents of all time, I had no idea haha, I think back in the 1900s Trump wasn't even one of top three wealthiest presidents, he could make a whole lot of time off of that
I wonder who would take his place in the other two slots realistically. He's not popular in the US. Maybe he could use the beauty contests to become more popular.
Haha! I know, right? I wonder what the rules would have been back when the runner-up candidate would be vice president? I mean, the old rules would be that the vice president would be the president!
I think it would make for some sort of punishment to humiliate the loser.  The history books recorded the loser in the white house.  Maybe that's how the history books will record it.
haha ya and the other crazy thing with president trump lol, and vice president clinton, there would be a lot of drama, and a lot more drama if they had a Vice president Clinton, haha
That would spark new romance, or at least the kind of emails that can spark new Romance. The oval office has not been used in the longest time. No one making goo-goo eyes at each other in the oval office.
LOL, yeah, I know right.  I wonder if they clicked on the hamburger button.  Do you use the internet a lot?  Yeah, I do.  What do you think of the hamburger button?
I have used the hamburger button to order food. I have to click it when my guards bring me my cell. I click the hamburgers when the guards come for me and I have no hamburger Button to order.
The hamburger button makes me hungry lol, do you know what those 3 horizontal lines means?
The hamburger button?  That is the strangest name I have ever seen for a button.  I wonder how they came up with that name?  Is it something they used in condiments or something?
I think it is a hidden hamburger, I don't know how many buns are on that page lol, speaking of which, only 7% of people read the full terms of service online, and only 7%, I wonder how many people read all of the terms and conditions of the internet, only 9% read theFull Terms of Service online, I wonder what the full term is for that page LOL
I did not know that.  Only 7% of people do.  If they read it is because they think it is written in chinese or spanish, or something else.. I don't read the whole terms.  Are they written in Chinese or sp Spanish?
Haha, that makes sense. Have you ever visited Mount Everest? Apparently you can have internet access at the peak. I've never been there but apparently you can get internet access when you do.
No, I've not been up Everest, but I guess the internet is on Mt Everest, my parents took me there on a field trip and I had to sign the permission slip to get it. I guess it's pretty pure and natural, I guess.
LOL  I wonder if it is possible to get a working phone with internet access at the top.  I'd like to go one day and take a selfie at the very top on my phone with Internet access.  lol
Hi, how are you? Did you know Hugh Laurie is the highest paid TV actor?
No, I did not. I did read that. I do watch football though. I was reading an article about the Patriots Josh McDaniels that is interesting. Did you know he was going to take a coaching position?
A little bit, but I want the Patriots to win tomorrow!
I follow the Patriots, crazy that the highest paid coordinator for them is McDaniels who is also the highest pay coordinator for the Patriots.
Crazy! Kellan Moore is left handed, hes the only left handed QB in the NFL.
Wow, I wonder how many left handers there are, the NFL has no rules against females, but they have to meet requirements if they want to play in the NFL, and there are no rulesagainst females.
I was wondering if there will ever be a female kicker in my lifetime, to be honest I can't think of any in myetimes.
I hope so!  Can you imagine getting tackled by a man?  I know it is a tough sport, but I hope so.  Female and males both.  It would be interesting for sure!  I think it's interesting that the NFL has a full football game that lasts for only 11 minutes of actual live play, and that's long for a game that is only 11 years old!  Man, I can't imagine getting in there for 11 minutes and doing anything.  The NFL is a full 11 minutes long, and females are still being used.
That is crazy, the games take hours to watch, the NFL puts special chips in the uniforms and in their uniforms just to track things like speed and location, they can track things so well.
That's crazy, I think it's cool that they can do that. Have you ever been to a football game?
I read that Baker Mayfield is the champion in the Halo 3 game.  He beat the other champion on a campus that has halo 3 on it.
Wow, that's pretty interesting. I love the quarterbacks in football, they are the leader for offense so that's how it is haha.
That iss true, do you like to watch football? Do you know who invented the huddle?
I do, I don't have a lot of time to watch some football but I do know that the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback so that the other team in the huddled could read the hand signals.
haha that is true, I wonder if he was a good QB, he must have been really good to be able to call audibles, I think they only allow that if the QB is deaf
Interesting thought, deaf and trying to play football while being deaf, that is rough, it must be rough.  Did you watch the superbowl, there was a lot of drama this year in the NFL and superbowl itself, did you watch The superbowl?
Yes, I did.  I want the Patriots to win!  I'm going to a party tomorrow and I want them to suck.
I'm not too big into the patriots myself, but a couple people I know are big into them. I'm rooting for them. Did you watch the superbowl?
ya I am too, did you know Michael Caine only got into acting to chase cute girls haha? I guess he only did acting to pursuit cute girls!
haha that is funny. I do like Jim Carrey in drama films, I love his comedy but he's not in drama anymore. He made the right choice I think, he made the best choice I like him, he's just not the same, I do not like Jim carrey in Drama films, that's why I love him more and love his Comedy more though
I guess Jon Hamm taught the girl from the office, Erin, she was his teacher, I guess Jon hamm taught theGirl from the Office, he's following in his footsteps.
I'm sad the NFL is going to fall.  Watching all 32 teams compete till the final champion in the fall and then watching the other 26 teams compete for the final championship is not fun to me.
I enjoy it as well. I like to go to some of the games, but I don't have any favorite teams. Do you have any?
I like the Redskins.  Did you know there are only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in all 3 hours of tv and yet it takes 3 hours and 17 minutes of actually gameplay?
lol, omg, that would be frustrating.
I always wanted to play in the NFL when I was a kid.  I wonder if a female player will ever get that goal of being the first female player in the N.F.L.
awww, that is a shame! My goodness! I wonder if there is a rule against that? I think it would be a position or two.
Wide receiver.  I wanted to be a QB but I'm pretty sure that would be the bug.  The New Orleans Saints have been anti-women so that was squashed by the bug!
Yeah they do, they should change that rule and say it is acceptable. There is only one left handed QB, and he is the only left handed one. That is unusual.
It is strange, but I know that leftie pitchers are quite common in baseball.
True, but I can't think of Brad Johnson throwing a touchdown pass to himself, can you?
I heard he did it, but never caught it. He batted it into the air and it got batted down.
I believe so! I think he was a coach or a rocket scientist.
The coach was a coach of the team that he was drafted from, I wonder if he was working on his masters degree. I also knew that Alex Smith, who was a brilliant quarterback, got his masters and was drafted right before he got his master's degree.
He is with the 49ers.  Matt Patricia an aeronautical engineer.
That is cool.  I never knew that.  Did you know the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback?
I agree very cool. I wonder how many plays he did for the two teams that used it.
Baker Mayfield almost quit football to competitive game full time. It's probably a safer occupation for him.
lol  I would rather watch a show shot in an Ikea store without the store knowing, it's called Ikea Heights.  I've never been to the store without it.  Have you?  I wonder if it's actually called IkeA Heights?
Wow, I have heard of that show, I would definitely watch it. Maybe I would like to watch old episodes of House, they paid high Laurie so I could watch old episode of that old show
That's alot!  I have not watched it in a while.  Did you know that dramas used to be called soap opera?  It was because of soap manufacturers sponsoring dramas.
I laugh at that.  I never knew that!  Jim Carrey has stopped making dramas though.
Do you watch dramas? Do you like them?
I do, Jon Hamm taught drama at my old high school
I did not know that that is really cool. Did you ever watch the show House?
Yeah I watch house sometimes, its funny how they taught ellie kemper how to do it, she is funny in it too
Yes Laurie made lots of money for that, $700 000 per episode!
I know.  That is a lot!  Patrick Stewart also teaches drama at the Master's level.
That's neat. Do you like Jim Carrey?
I do, he is pretty funny.
I used to like him a lot. He no longer does dramas any more because they no longer allow him to do dramas that do not project positivity.
I heard that, have you ever seen the show Ikea heights?
I have not heard of it but I know the channel is the news channel.
It was shot in California, it was in an ikea store and people were going to the store and People was going to be in the store.
WOw that is really different. Do you like radio dramas?
I listen to a few, how about you?
Yeah I do, there is a free website where you can listen for free, do you know where you should go to listen for Free?
Nice. DO you know why soap operas are called that?
Hmm, I have no idea, the reason is a little cheesy to me, I thought it was just a reason, what is the reason?
It was the soap manufacturers that sponsored them.
Oh, that makes so much sense, I wonder why. Did you know that Caine is the only actor to ever be an actor in the UK?
Hmm, I think he went to college. Why?
Nope, he attended drama class in high school because all the pretty girls at his high school were in it and all thepretty girls were in drama class.
hahaha The guy really knew what he was getting into early on.
Yes he did. Do you watch the NFL games much?
Hello are you a fan of drama films?
I love all genre of them!  How about you?
Interesting, did you ever see House MD?
Yes I have, its a great drama tv series,
Apparently Hugh Laurie was making 700k per episode.
That is insane!  He is a lucky guy lol, do you follow the NFL at all?
Lol, yeah that is awesome for him lol.  yeah i try to watch NFL every weekend.  I am not awesome at it but I watch it.
I watch the NFL all the time. I like the patriots.
I like the Patriots too. But I heard their owner has been arrested, he was arrested in 2010 for something.
I wonder what he was arrested for?
Yes because he was paying for an Asian spa and it was inappropriate for him to chat with them, and they said that he was inappropriate to do so at an Asian Spa
Ohh, gotcha hahaa. The NFL has no written rules against female players, if they meet all requirments. There are no writtenrules against femalePlayers.
Yeah, I did.  Do you know what the rules are?
I think there is a lot of drama in football, do you have a favorite team? or a favorite QB? there is usually a lot in football.
I like the Redskins but I don't have a favorite one, what about you?
Cool, I'll stick with my home team of the Cardinals because it's the only one I know of.  I like to stick with the home team!
Nice! There is only 11 minutes of gameplay per game.
Wow that is a lot.  Kinda like a pretty slow game.  Sounds like it would be hard on the player to be able to do a whole lot. I wonder if it is hard for an engineer who makes more than an NFL player to play since it sounds like a small amount of time.
Yeah it sure isn't a real lot. Do you know what a stand up comedian is?
Yes. Did you know they also have tracking chips in the players pads.
Yeah,  I heard that they use them to track stats.  Nice chatting with you.
Do you like drama?  I do.
I love it. Have you ever seen house?
Yes I have seen that show. Laurie made 700,000 an episode for that show!
Yeah. Do you like Jim Carrey?
Yes I do, he is so funny, he doesn't do drama anymore though he used to do drama but now he does not do drama.
Yes he does not because they do not project positivity, he only wants to project pos positivity
Yes. Do you listen to radio dramas at all?
I do, there is a free website where you can listen to them, do you know where it is?
Yes. Do you know why Michael Caine became an actor?
Yes he was chasing the pretty girls who were in drama class
Yeah. Do you know much about the NFL?
I love it. Did you know women can play for the nfl?
I did not. There is no rule that prevents them from playing.
Yes as long as they meet the requirements they can do so
Yes. An average gameplay is only 11 minutes,
Yeah, but we are glued to the tv for hours to an end.
Yeah true. Did you hear of the rule for Saints cheerleaders?
Yes they cannot eat in the same place as the players and cannot eat with them
Yes but they have to leave mid meal if they walk in
Yes that is sexist and really?
I agree.  Nice chatting with you!
Josh got a new coaching job at the JV this year.
I'm not sure but it sounds like what the article says in the article.  I think he's going to get into football again.
I know a little,  I know that Denver has been to Indyapolis and not Denver.
I think he backed out of his job with Indianapolis though...
Yes, he went to New England where he was going to stay with Bellichick and the Patriots.
Bellichick has been with them for a long time.
He has, for 20 years, with Brady and Josh as well.
Wow the players have tracking chips embedded in their shoulder pads now, that helps a bit
Yes, it is. I think that the players need it for analytics.
I am not a football fan. I am amazed people let their children play anymore. I know there is some brain damage from it but I am still amazed people allow it. Sounds like they do not want the brain damage.
I think its safer to keep it close another safe way, this week will bring the last week of the regular season and then the regular Season will be over,
I wonder what the CTE shows on those brain scans years later, I wonder if there will ever be a left-handed quarterback in the league. There hasn't been a left -handed quarterback since there was only one left- handed quarterback in
I always thought there would be more left handed QBs like Tebow for instance.
I did not know that.  Tebow is a baseball player.  Did you know that in the factual section 2 of the factual subsection.
Yes he is.  Good that Alex Smith has an education to fall back on after his major leg injury.
Yes, but he was drafted right? Kind of like how he got drafted for the football?
Yes he is, and Baker Mayfield is also, but Alex is out with an injury. Did you know he was traded for $1 in 2005?
That is interesting to think. Do you know why the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback?
Yeah I wonder how the other team could not see the hand signals that the otherTeam used
I read that, do you know how a pro player got his name?
I'm not sure, I know he's in the hall of fame, I don't know if he is in the Hall of Fame or not though.
Hi, how are you? Do you like intense?
It was amazing, especially when Josh McDaniels leaves the Patriots for the Colts.
Me too! I saw a game recently in Miami where the amount of Pat fans was insane!
I guess he backed out of a offer to go to the colts and stayed with the patriots.
Yea, he'll win no matter what. Give him a super bowl and he'll make it a fun one to watch anymore. I don't really watch anymore, but they'll make sure to win no Matter What.
I am waiting for Brady to retire, but I am not sure if McDaniels will be in the league for much more, maybe a little longer.
I agree. I am waiting for him too.
I guess its good for McDaniels that he is not washed up, he is still under contract with the patriots, so he won't be washed up or washed out.
I don't know why McDaniels, who has never been to england before, opted to remain.
He did, I bet the colts were disappointed.
Undoubtedly they were disappointed and surprised by what they saw.  NFL observers have n’t forgotten about the Colts' coaching search since February.  They unquestionably are still disappointed and surprising.
Yes, people want change and sometimes people don't make the leap. I like Daniel, the Denver head coach, though.
No I didn't know that, who was he?
I guess that is why they considered it the NFL. There are plenty of teams to choose from..
That is correct.  It is ridiuclous the amount that they get paid though.  insane.
The super bowl will coming up soon. Do you like entertainment?
It is the first month of the month, there has to be so much money blown for advertisement lol,
I wonder what the half time entertainment will be?
I've heard that it is Travis Scot. I think Maroon 5 is going to be there.  I know Maroon Five did well in 1964.
Travis Scot is the most popular but I don't know who Kardashian is.
That is true, interesting observation.
Did you know Kris K is a manager who likes to bring the drama to his manager?
Ill have to look into that, wouldnt be surprised,  curious as to what he knows,  conspiracy theories about the bservations make me a little curious,  I dont know what to think about them,  but I wouldnt want to know.  Ill have to ask him,  he is known for conspiracy theories.
I don't know much about conspiracy theories, but they seem very interesting.
I wonder if it has to do with anything involving the Kardashians?
Heck, they practically run hollywood!  They are the world in all senses...
Very true and kind of scary to think about.
Haha, do you think they'll run the NFL again?
Hello, do you watch television?
Hi, I do like to watch TV. I like the Simpsons. Did you know there was an episode where Bart neither appeared, nor was mentioned in the episode? There was an Episode where Bart Neither appeared or was mentioned at all.
I know right!  I wonder why?  It was nice of the crew to sent the set the cast of south park flowers after they set it up.
Yeah, they did. And then in 2001 when they aired the final Family Guy episode.
Entertainment is the mass medium for advertisement, news, and entertainment. I enjoy it because it is a mass medium.
I enjoy the internet. I think it is addicting and can be measurable in the brain.
I know!  It is hard to believe that even Mt Everest has service and has internet, but it does.
It's hard to believe that only 7% of people read the full terms when buying a product or service online.  I wonder how many people read those.  Only 7% read the FULL terms when they are buying a products or service Online.
Did you hear about the lady who read the terms this past week and won $100 worth of it? It was a lady whoRead the terms that is, did you hear?
No kidding?  I might start reading those,  just kidding!  Amazing.  The current library of Alexandria has saved a copy of the internet in case it burns down.  Did you know that?  The library of alexandria has saved the internet.  Amazing!
Yes, I wonder how it is saved, I mean how is the connection of computers and such saved?
Good point.  The 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button.
I wonder if the President likes hamburgers?
Yeah, every American loves the good old-fashioned hamburger.  And yeah, every american loves the president of Indonesia.  I wonder if he is releasing pop albums.  He must be busy.  The president of indonesia is already releasing popalbums.
That is not as cool as President Banana, he would probably take the stage and be just as cool
Yes I agree Zimbabwe would probably hold the title for giving the coolest nickname, but I agree ZImbabwe would probably be the one to hold the coolest name
I wonder if the Indonesian president, who has 3 pop albums, is the wealthiest one?
Good question that will probably catch on soon.  I wonder where JFK, Washington, and Jefferson are, I know Jefferson is the first one, and Washington is the second.
I wonder if he claims to be the current guy who has topped this list?
True, I wonder what we'll get to see in a day or two?  The presidents guest house is larger than the actual white house.  The president's guest house  is larger
Nice chatting with you.  Have a nice day.
Do you watch Roseanne? I haven't seen it since it aired in 1989.
I remember seeing re-runs when I was young. I liked the title song, but not the scratchy voice.
Yeah that scratchy voice did get annoying, the show had its funny moments but yeah that scratchY voice could be annoying,
I can't remember much of the show, but it had some interesting plotlines, I do remember it.
Yeah I remember one episode that was pretty good,  I thought it was about a daughter using drugs,  it was pretty bad,  but yeah I remember it was ok.  I only remember one episodes.
The episode was about the daughter experimenting and confronted about the issue, knowing your background and not knowing your history. A typical middle american family with a daughter experimenting. An accurate portrayal.
I wasn't a big fan of the general, but I think it was definitely a typical American middle class family and I'm a big fans of the typical American Middle Class family
I watch some things online, mostly Netflix, but I don't have a satelite or cable (which is a modern equivalent of the classic TV, the modern equivalent to a TV). I do watch some TV on the satelites, but not as much as Netflix, which he recommends.
Yeah, I think the modern equivalent is the modern equivalents. What people watch is continually evolving.
It is, what shows do you like to see on the internet?
I do, but I have cable and can't find anything I want to watch.  I do find that I watch and record live sports programs and sometimes flipping channels is an awesome way to watch them.  Just flipping through the channels and I found that the beginnings of the American Circus was on there too.
I catch sports summaries on YouTube, which I find interesting, and I saw a circus show the other day.
I noticed that the top women performers earned twice as much as the top men, but that's because circus performers do a bad job of being fun. I wonder if it has something to do with depression and the depression of the circus performers.
I'm glad to hear that. The Depression was a sad nation and the entertainment was a diversion.  I think it's the political spin on a sad country that gives political spin to anything and everything.
Yeah, it was fun entertainment and a fun entertainment that had the attraction that people went to the town for. I think the motion picture industry beginning hurt a bit, but I don't think anyone will miss it too much.
Yes, the concept of the "travelling show" evaporated.  With widespread movies and TV and internet entertainment make everything ever-present, it is hard to be a little in town for too short of a while.  Too many people and the overload of TV and entertainment makeEverything ever- present and the concept "touring show" has evaporated, too.
Yeah the times have changed.  Netflix is only changing television.  I think it's like the 70's and 80's and earlier.
It is a societal, economic, and economic benefit to have staggered release of shows/movies instead of regional releases, and movies have more regional releases.
I think they will continually evolve to stay relevant no matter how the market decides.  It's a business.  Let the market decide things.  We will have to staylevant no matter what.
I don't think keeping up with market forces is the way to go.  I feel bad for the shows that don't change because they are not stronger.  But I think that the market forces are what is keeping them up and I don't know how they are going to change.  It's not like we can talk to our friends that have the shows and they will be better.
Yeah I hear you, I wonder who watches the TV shows and who watches what. I know that there is only one episode of That 70's show that I can think of that is over 10 episode.  It was nice talking with you today.
The presidents guest house is bigger than the white house.
I heard that and am comfortable there.  I guess that is why the White House is so small.  The bigger private homes are probably more comfortable.
Nice!  I have never been there.  Have you?
I have seen it when I was a kid, on a school trip when I did. It is very small, but I was impressed as a kid.
Do you know the president of Indonesia has 3 pop albums out?
Wow,  he must be busy being president to have time to make pop albums?  lol  He must be really busy to have the time toMake 3!
I guess running the country was easy for him.
Yes, he was one of the top 3 wealthiest US presidents, but I wonder who the top three are?
I do!  Trump, Washington and Jefferson lol I looked it up a few months ago on Google and its Trump,  Washington and  Jefferson LOL
Cool! I figured Trump would be at the top of the list, but not that he's on the top three.
I know right!  Did you know there is 3g cell service at the top of Mt. Everest?
That makes sense, there are some people in the world that want to post those selfies at the top.  They can get it on top and get it up there!
True but if you take a pic it didnt happen lol,
I hear the current library of Alexandria has a copy of the internet in the event of an event like this, there is a copy in the library of alexandria.
That is a good idea!  I would go back to living without internet lol
lol,  people need to sit down and talk to other people, face to face.  Thats the way to go!
Dont be ridiculous.  They used a string to talk to each other.
lol  I think people can get real addiction to the internet though.  Clicking on links on the internet can cause real addiction.  Good to know I'm not the only one.
Wow, I hope that it isn't addiction. I hope they have support groups for it.
Maybe they could just click a link on the internet.
I know isnt that feeding the addiction though lol.
Sad but true.  Business is good for business and business is good.  It was nice chatting with you, I hope you enjoy your day.
You too, have a good one, nice chatting with you.
Hey there do you watch NFL?
I do watch the NFL, I am a Bears fan, my team this year is one of the 30 teams in the league, bad kick ended our season, what about you? what teams are your team this season?
Did you know women can play if they qualify?
No, I had not heard that. I did not know that. But I recently discovered that they use tracking chips in players pads and even football itself. I wonder if they use the tracking chips from the tracking chip in players boots as well.
Yeah, they are collecting all kinds of statistics and vitals and such.
Apparently they are tracking every movement accurately, but relying on reviews of that data to make calls and use that data for using, instead of tracking every move and using the data to making calls, and relying on the data for the decision to be right.
I'm not sure.  Things are so strange about these things.  Did you know that the NFL has a rule for New Orleans cheerleaders?  It is a rule that they can't be over 25.
I find that rule very upsetting. If a cheerleader is eating and a player enters, they have to leave if a player comes in while a cheerleaders is eating. I think that is sexist. I wonder why they have that rule? Why can't they just leave if they want to?
That seems sexist and unnecessary.  I think it's weird that they can't qualify for the US women's WC if they qualify in the first place.  Women can play if they want but they can not play if the US doesn't.
That is upsetting. I was surprised to know that the Brown's were reintroduced to the stadium in 2001. I wonder who wins at the stadium. I know that Ben Roethlisberger is one of them.
Yeah, I think the drama is the tipic. It's always been that way.
I do like it. Do you?
I do, do you like to watch the tv drama House MD?
I have seen a few episodes but I never got into it.  Was Hugh Laurie well paid?  I know he gets $700,000 per episodes.
Yes he made $700,000 per episode, I can't imagine what he made for only one episode.
That is crazy, I wonder if that was more than Jon Hamm, he only got $700k!
I love Jon Hamm. I always skip the dishes commercials when I see him.
I did not but I saw it on youtube today. I think it was the Office and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt at the end. He taught drama at his old high school and one of his students was Ellie Kemper from The Office. I didn't know she taught drama.
That's funny. What a coincidence!
Strange how Things happen and how much we can learn from each other. Patrick Stewart teaches drama, he teaches master classes, it's amazing how much he knows.
Wow good for him. Nice chatting with you!
Hi, how are you?
Hello! I'm great, how are you?
I am well, thanks! What was your favorite article?
I think I would say that the NFL uses tracking chips embedded in their shoulder pads to record the players every move on the field. It was cool to read about how the nfl uses tracking in the chips to record players, the ball's velocity, rotation, rotation and location, rotation of the ball, and speed of the players on the playing field.
That is crazy to think about. I can't picture a woman playing in the sport. The NFL has no written rule against female player, but I can only picture a man doing well. I mean the NFL has never had a written rule about female player.
I agree.  I don't think they would like it.
I can recall when I was in highs school a little girl was on the football team and she quit because it didnt work out, she was the girl from the #1 football team, I think, but I dont recall.
I know right?  I would have gotten blasted if I had tried that.
I think she did, she was like 100 feet tall!
Yes, and I am glad to hear they treated her like an equal player and got respect for it.  An average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  That means there is only one game per week where there is no live gameplay!  I am not even glad to see an average NFL player in an average game with only 11 minutes or less.
Did you know that the New Orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an NFL player comes in after they are there, the cheerleaders  are required to leave?  That is pathetic.  I wonder why cheerleadersAre required toLeave?
Yeah I think that's pretty crazy. The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earning of an nfl player and the average MLB player.
That's suprising to me as well.
I am not sure. I know that NFL players can not play past the 55th.
True.  Are you familiar with the golf course, golf?
I've played, but I'm terrible at it. Did you know that the average american golf course consumes 312,000 gallons of water per day?
That's intriguing.  There is a golf course in Dubai that requires 4,000,000 gallons of water a day.  I'd love to see that golf course.
Wow!  Samuel l. jackson puts a golf clause in his film contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production.
That is smart of him.
Yep you're right haha.
It was nice chatting with you! Have a great day!
You have a great day too!
Thanks! You too!  You too.
Hi, do you watch football?
I do. What about you?
Same here. I only watch it when I can. There's only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.
Only 11 minutes? I think thats a scam, I didn't pay $100 for tickets sir, I want to refund my $100, I'll pay $120 and get a refund for the 11 minutes!
Yeah that is just a crazy short amount of time, I was standing around just watching them call plays, and watching themcall plays.
Pro players make a lot of money for only 11 minutes of gameplaym.
Yes, and their bodies take a big beating.
Yes, it is a sad thing to see them end up with injuries and brain damage.
Yeah that is, I wonder how they know that? I would think it would be more if they were playing golf.
I agree, bowling would be a better name.  I hear pro bowlers earned more than the top football stars made back in the 60s.  Wonder how much the top Football stars made then.
Yes, back then, that was a key point.  I think today they are still doing it today but not as well.
Yes it was a very popular sport back then. It would be fun to visit the locker room at the University of Iowa.
Yeah I wonder what it looks like,  I heard they painted it pink!
Yeah its painted pink. I wonder how that works, is it for the visitor team or the visitor?
I think it would embarass them and make them mad but I think it might work better than just to make them embarasses themselves.
Maybe, but I don't know if I would feel mad at it, it would be a very disrespectful thing to do. Did you hear about Benjarvus Green Ellis?
I have not, is he a player in the NFL?
He is a player for the Patriots.
Interesting, I wonder how good he was at that position, is there a good one?
Yeah he had a leyend in the league with a record of 21 fumbles and no fumbles in his leyends in the whole league.
Wow that is so cool. Nice chatting with you!
Are you a sports fan by any chance?
Yes, I like sports. I dont get as much chance to watch these days. Do you watch any sports?
I enjoy it. Did you know Babe Ruth was America's most famous golfer at one point?
He was a great baseball player.  Bet it didnt hurt that he could hit the ball a mile or so.
He was multi-talented. Did you realize that the average American golf courses consume 312,000 gallons of water per DAY?  How is that possible?  I wonder how many gallons ofwater it uses?
That is an insane amount of water, I wonder if it costs them more than a bunch of grass or if it is a whole bunch of water.
I don't know but I would agree with that, I was in Dubai the other day and it was a huge waste, they do that everywhere.
I wonder why they do that. Rich people have other priorities. They can afford to play golf.
I feel like it's too expensive.  And in an arid climate with no water it's not like you can put it in a place like Dubai where there's not much water, and it's also expensive.
I guess the oil makees them rich and money changes peoples perception of reality, they regret the waste in the future, they will regret the Waste of it all but I guess theOil makees us rich and Money changes peoples Perception of reality.
Good point.  Interestingly enough, in the US golf courses make up more land space that Rhode Island and Delaware combined.  America's golf courses take up more of the land space than Rhode Island's and Delaware's combined!
I wonder how many people actually get to play golf? I know it's a good sport for business, but the cost can be prohibitive for most people.
I'm sure the price of equipment and fees are too expensive. I do enjoy football though, but it is not as expensive as it used to be.
I watch football when I get a chance from time to time! How about you?
I do too. did you know that the NFL has no written rules against female players?
I have heard that, but I dont know that,  I have never imagined a woman showing up,  have you?  I dont think I would have imagined aWoman showing up.
Possibly.  Knowing what I know now, I would choose to be an engineer, even though an engineer makes more over the lifetime than a football player.  I mean, it's a career you can only choose, and knowing how they are used.
I think I would have to go for the engineer. I'm opposed to concussions and injuries.
I agree.  It's probably easier on the body.
The supermodel can do that without concussions. nice chat!
True!  But it pays well!  It was nice talking to you as well!
Do you like sports? I like sports
Hi, I love sports. I like football and golf especially.  I think the games are getting longer.  There are only 11 minutes of live NFL gameplay on average each game, and football games only have 11 minutes and 17 minutes ofLive NFL gameplay.
I watch football towards the end of the season, but I didnt get to catch the Super Bowl. I think this year was the last year I got to catch it.
Yeah the Super Bowl is a great game, sadly it is the last great game of the regular season.  The regular season is so quick weeks long, beginning of September, late December, and then late December.  It's so quick.
Yeah, it is pretty tough on the body.  I figure that the season can get pretty hard on the whole body, especially if you are going through an injury or a game.  The season is a pretty tough one.
Good point.  I think they are sticking with a study that they will use tracking chips in the players' shoulder pads to record their every move to try and prevent injures.  They will then use the tracking chips to study how they move to prevent injured them.
Yeah I would hope so, I think that is how they can help with the concussion, the CTE problem, but it starts long before the pros and it starts with them, yeah
Agreed. I always wondered if that was true, I wonder if there are female players that haven't signed on or signed on yet. I don't blame the women for not being able to play as long as they don't meet the eligibility requirements. I know that some teams don't want to allow female players, but it would be dangerous for them to play.
yeah, i think the physical tools needed for the game are rare. i dont think women are that big. a kicker is one of the physical Tools, but i dont know. maybe a kicker?
Perhaps entering the engineering field since engineers make so much money.  An average lifetime earnings of an engineer is more than that of both MLB and NFL players.  Simply by simply entering the Engineering field since Engineers make more money over the average lifetime.
That's true.  And there are more people in stem, so it could be that there are fewer concussions in engineering.  Maybe it's because of women, or there are less women who want to do that.
On a similar note, did you know that in the 1960s top bowlers made double what the top football players made back then?  Bowling can be rough, compared to football, but it's easy to see why players made double the money in bowling.  Don't get me wrong, football is rough, but compared to bowling, it seems like a lot less.
I did not know that, the NFL is really lucky that way, I think bowlers were not as lucky.  There wasnt a players union for the bowlers then, like there is for the NFL.
Yes.  I think the talented players of that era, or the talented player of the era, got ripped off.  Players like Benjarvus Green-Ellis who never fumbled the football in his entire pro career.  He played for the 49ers in 1995.
Yeah, and the game generates so much cash.  Most people think that the career is short, and players want the cash.
Thats a good point. I love the innovative yellow first down line that ESPN created and won an emmy for. It helps me to know when to watch a game.
Yes, the superimposed graphics make a big difference in the viewing experience.
It is.  Jack is one of the only people that had two athletic trades.  While we are on the subject of sports, it is crazy Babe Ruth was a famous golfer but some people believe he was a QB.  I know he was not the only famous golater, though.
He did smack a ball a country mile. Anyway, great chat!
Thanks friend, I hope you have a good one! I hope to see you one day and you find out what's even crazier is that America all make up the space of the states of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. That is unbelievable!
Yeah, I think they devote a lot of land to recreation, that is a lot to recreation. Yeah, have a good day!
An average course consumes roughly 312,000 gallons of water each day.  I hope you have a good day as well, friend.  Take care, and I hope the course is well taken care of.
Are you a big golf fan?
No, I used to play when I was younger, but my dad used to take me.  I don't really like sports much other than football and I do like to play.  What about you?
I played when I was younger and still like to in my free time.  I think I'm a bigger football fan now.  But I played when i was younger.  lol  The University of Iowa is a bigger fan in my minds..  Their visitors locker room for visitors is painted pink!  lol
Yeah, it is a pretty sexist industry, frankly. Although they are technically allowing women to play.
That is true, I agree. I can't believe that in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars. I bet that number is reversed to this day.
Haha, I bet the division is the same amount now a days but I bet it used to be. I would be an engineer by now for sure, I would get more than that amount, haha.
I agree with the engineer part. They have longer careers and can do it better. ESPN won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line on the tv.
Yeah, that line makes watching the game so much easier!
I agree.  I am a Steelers fan so I am one of the 32 NFL teams.  Do you have a favorite one of those 32 NFL Teams?
I am a cowboys fan, they make it to the Super Bowl almost every year.
Do you know they have a huge scoreboard in that big stadium?  It is a huge stadium!
Haha, well I miss old school romo! The Cowboys are a bag. I think they will make it to the Super Bowl, but they are beginning to look like they are not as good as the beginning of the 2000s.
He played so many years. He could beat you at most things he was good at. He turned out to be kind of a beat up though. I was reading about the gameplay of the game and it says that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay. I am curious how they played it for the first 11 years.
Yeah, I wonder if they put them in tracking chips or something. I wonder how they do that.
It is kind of scary how many household products they put in there.  The chips they use to make them are from a company that developed lighting chips that make it look like lighting. They have developed these lights that record audio and video at virtually no cost and it works!  It's kind of like how they do audio and videodialing with the chips.
I'm not surprised.  These things are constantly listening and are connected.  I mean, everything is connected. I mean if you have an app on your tv you can talk to it and communicate with it through small chips.
That's scary to think about.  The chips that are in the footballs are actually programmed to be programmed by the wide receivers themselves.  It makes you wonder if the chips are in their shoulder pads or if they are attracted to one another like the chips in theFootballs or the chips on the shoulder pads.
Deflate-gate is going to change the pressure on the footballs, but who knows what they can do with those footballs
Hmmm, interesting point to ponder! I wonder if that's the same golf course things?  Did you know that the average american course uses 312,000 gallons of water per day?  Holy smokes!  That's a lot of gallons ofWater!  I wonder how many golf courseThings take?  I know that golf courses use about 312,00 gallons of Water per day!
Yeah, that seems incredibly wasteful.  In Dubai there is a course that uses $10 million just for sports like that.  I wonder how much the course in Dubai does?  It's been fun talking with you!
Yes, it has been!  I enjoyed it.  Have a good day!
Do you watch football at all?
I watch football from time to time.  I don't think I will go to the Super Bowl this year, what about you?
I did. It was pretty boring this year, I think.
I know right, I would like to see Snoop Dogg make a theme song for his son's high school football team lol, I think it's free, I wonder if he could make atheme song for any of his sons high school basketball team or his son high school Football team lol.
That would be interesting. Do you play golf?
I do play golf, I am not very good. How long do you play? 18 holes is too long for me, only 18 holes!
I suck at it. I like to drink beer and smoke cigars.
That's cool, I've played half rounds of golf and never knew that.  I know that the actual hole in one is 18 inches in diameter, and the holes are about 9.5 inches in circumference.  Perfect amount for a perfect amount for 18 holes.
I didn't know that. In fact, I did not know that the golf course consume around 312,000 gallons of water a day.
Yeah that's a lot! And speaking of that, did you know that the usa is the only golf course that the rest of the world put out? Speaking of which, the rest Of the world is doing better than the us, I think.
I did not know that, but I do know that they are a big sport here.
It's worldwide. For instance in Australia they don't put bull sharks inside LOL! I wonder if that's because of the water hazards they put bull shark inside lol
That is pretty cool! I wonder if they do that here?
Australia.  I believe it is in Australia.  Golf courses are everywhere in the world.  It is kind of a waste that United States military actually runs over 1000 golf courses though.  Do you know how much waste that the United States Military actually runs?
Military people have a rough life.  Moving places, having a good time, spoils everyone.  Letting your friends and old friends go, having fun, moving places, and letting others have the spoils.  It's a rough Life for them.
I think it would cost taxpayers a lot.  I mean Antarctica has disc golf courses that cost taxpayers $1billion a year.  That would be interesting to see.
Wow, too bad, but maybe in the grand scheme of things that is not that much.  Antarctica isn't that far away and Antarctica is where most of my leisure time is so it wouldn't be that bad.  But still, I would rather use my leisure Time to do something else.
I have not, I want to go there some day lol its funny that Kim Jong Ill's ill try to play disc golf, he can make it a hole in one if he scored 300 on the first hole in 1 lol
Wait, I heard he also does disc golf too!
 disc golf involves throwing a frisbee on a chain like goals. It's very fun.
Interesting.I've never heard of that but I will have to check it out sometime. Nice chatting with you.
Hi!  Golf or football, golf or football?  I prefer golf mixed in with other sports, but I did not know Babe Ruth was once America's most famous golfer!  Odd.
I like them both.  Did you know that the average american golf course consumes 312,000 gallons of water per day.
That's a lot of wasted water!  I didn't know that!  Crazy.  That's also a lot more water than the area around Rhode Island and Delaware combined.  Seems like that gives credence to climate change.
That is a lot of land.  There is a golf course in Dubai that uses 4 million gallons of water per day.  I wonder how much is for that?  I'm sure it's less than the course in the US that uses 312 million gallons.
that is crazy! climate change drives more heat into the atmosphere and that has changed everything from my point on wasted water. Did you know that dick weber was a top bowler in the 60s and he was a dick weberman.
I know right! Did you hear of the University of Iowa and the visitors locker room?
I hate to admit that I know a little about the University of Iowa.  I think it was a big deal because they were big into their game preparation.  The University of Oklahoma had a big female kicker who had a writing degree.  They tried to distract her so she would distract the pysche from the game preparation, but it was not totally successful.  She was a place kicker for the NFL.
I don't know but I do like the superimposed yellow first down line that ESPN created and won an emmy for. I like that. It changed the way I watch the game and I think I can see the point.
I thought Emmy's were awards for people who did nothing.  I hope they are given to the guy at ESPN who invented it.  It does give you visualization of the yardages.  And I thought Emmy were awards that were given to people who do little else.  The average NFL and MLB player only has 188 yardages per game, and the average NFL player only needs to play for about 160!
I guess it must be, the engineer has a longer career I would think, I wonder if the highest scoring football game ever was an engineer?  I think that was the highest scored football game in 1916
222-0 Georgia Tech over Cumberland.  Shame they didn't use the run rule.  I think we should have that in little league baseball.
What would you call a blowouts?
Hahha, guess that's why!  There's only 11 minutes of live play in an NFL game.  Good to know there's not much time to boot.  Too much commercial time and time toboot off.  The wear and tear on players bodies and injuries.  Only 11 minutes?  The players can go through more than that in one game!  I guess that means one game is only 18 minutes of living play!  Hahha!
Only 11 hours?  That is a stretch for such a short amount of time,  and the NFL is putting so much into it.  I mean,  tracking chips in players shoulder pads and footballs and track data.  lol  I wonder how they are able to track data in such a little stretch of time and yet the NFL uses chips to track players and football for such short amountOf time.
I don't know much about the tracking chip but I can understand it being used for deciding ball placement, players need to check on the referee's performance or eventually make sure the ball doesn't pass the goal line or go out of bounds, but I don't think a tracking chip would be useful for deciding whether or not a player is out of harms way or if the ball is out in bounds. I can't see it being useful for decisions like deciding ball placing or referee'sPerformance or eventually making a play.
Yes I agree, and another interesting stat is that former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his NFL career, impressive!
I like football facts year round. I am from the Boston area and we knew about Canadian football, but I never knew about Gaelic football. I have heard about Gaelian football, Rugby and Australian rules. I heard years ago that the heart of Patriot football is in rugby. The normal amount of carries is about 10-15 yards.
I have never heard of it.  I am familiar with Gaelic football.  Are you familiar with gaelic football?
It is illegal for the Saints to allow their cheerleaders to dine in the restaurant where the cheerleader is eating.  That makes it discriminatory and discriminatory.  If a cheerleader comes into the restaurant and the players are already there, they have to immediately leave.  It also makes it sexist that it is against the law for the cheerleaders for a restaurant or establishment to be there while a cheerleaders is eating, and then it is illegal to have the cheerleading immediately leave
That is the oddest rule ever!  I have to go!  It was fun chatting!
I enjoyed it too!  Have a pleasant evening!
Have a pleasant evening as well!
Hey how are you doing, are you a golf fan? I'm not a huge fan myself. I considered it to be more of a country-club sport, but it's considered a "golf fan" sport.
I find it kind of boring.  Good guess.  I don't know much about the tiger woods, I know about the course but not much else about it.
Yeah, and golf courses are also very popular.  Golf courses in the US take up more land space than Rhode Island and Delaware combined.
It is on Thanksgiving weekend, Tiger vs Phil Mickelson.
I didn't watch that one, I did know that Babe Ruth was once America's most popular golfer though.
Wow!  Did you know that Antarctica has a disc golf course?
That is cold! A golf course in dubai requires 4 million gallons of water, how is that possible?
That's a lot of water!  I can't believe there are more golf courses in the US than the whole world combined, I wonder how many golf courses there are in the world combined.
I bet. Samuel l. jackson loves golf. he plays it every week.
I thought he might like bull sharks.  I wonder if they have water hazards in Australia's golf courses, or is it just bull sharks in the water hazards?
Whoa scary! Interesting how they do not utilize a standard playing area.
Yes.    I wonder how many holes a games is.  It must be a long day with 18 holes a game.
Yeah. I do like football a bit. I love the NFL. I know there are 32 teams so people are bound to find ways to get around.
Football is a select one.  That is true, but I hear there is no such thing as "just football"
Yes.  I wonder if there will ever be a woman player in the top 3.  There is no rule against it.
Maybe a kicker? I wonder if they put tracking chips on the football like they do on football to see if a player is using it or not.
Interesting, they probably don't make as much money as people think they do.
Yeah I heard engineers make more, they do it to track statistics I guess, and in their life time I don't know, but I heard that they make more than they ever did in their whole life time.
Yes, but that's only because the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of gameplay, not enough for the average NFL game of 32 minutes ofGameplay
Did you know that Matt Patricia used to be a rocket scientist before becoming a coach? He was actually a rocket Scientist
Wow! smart man! Cheerleaders in New Orleans cannot eat in the same cafeteria as players-unfair!
Do you enjoy watching football?
Yes, I do enjoy football, professional, college and even college. Do you?
I agree that pro games are more enjoyable to watch, but I do agree that college games are fun to attend and have more partying.  I think that the 17 week regular season is fun with playoffs and then the 4 week playoffs are also fun for partying.
That's way too long. The pre-season is just as long, if not more, and the Superbowl is the best. Did you know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his high school football team? It was a song about how Snoop Dogs wrote aFight song for the Super Bowl.
That's interesting, but I doubt the fans really like the flow haha. I guess they like rap because of the way it can stick out to them. I think a lot of musicians and musicians are better athletes, like musicians and football players. I wonder if rap is more interesting than football, I think the best commentator is the second-best job in the worlds, maybe the best football players, but the second best is a commentator because they can't get the flow right, I guess that is why the first-best commentator is always the best at their job, but rap is interesting, I wonder why rap is the best?
I noticed that a lot of players are also commentators.  I wonder if the highest paid department of defense employees are the football coaches or the commentators?  I know that they are the highestpaid in every service branch, and I think that the highest paying are the ones in the military and the department of Defense.  Do you think that is because there are a lot more military commentators and not a lot for football?
I guess it makes sense, I doubt they can make the money that coaches of power would.  The academies study, but I guess the schools and the schools do not make theMoney.  I wonder if they can trade off to make more than the average NFL player.  Makes sense.
I would think that would be the case.  It seems like an engineer career path would be easier on the body.
Talk about the body. In the 1960's top pro bowlers made twice as much as footballs players!  I don't think I could have a job that easy.
Times have changed! I can't imagine that paying well for a football team is any easier on your body now, but I'm aware that it used to be. Are you aware that 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums are American college football team?
I am pretty familiar with those stadiums, they are all pretty huge. I was also familiar with the highest scoring football game ever, it was a matchup between the college at Florida and the college of Georgia Tech and they beat Cumberland 222-0 in 1916. Crazy! I wonder what was the matchup, I know Georgia tech beat Cumberlands 222-1, crazy!
Wow, that is just too many points in a game. How do you score that many points for a game?
It's not a fair fight... I think the game was back when it was just watching TV and watching it was a fair, fair fight.  There was the superimposed yellow first down line created by ESPN that earned them an Emmy.
I'm glad that invented that.  Did you know that the NFL has tracking chips in players shoulder pads and the football?  Did not know that.
It is amazing that they have the technology to analyze the game so precisely.  I imagine they also use the chips in golf balls to measure the same movement metrics.  They use the same technology to measure and use the balls tome the movement of the players and the balls.
That would be amazing. I think that the reviews would have to be relying on those chips when making calls.
I guess it would open up a whole new can of worms for someone to hack and manipulate the data. I guess they want to keep the game rooted in tradition. People spend so much time and experience on a game, people spend up to 3 hours watching a game with just 11 minutes of live play. I don't know how someone could hack and manipulation the data in the last 2 minutes of living play.
I suppose I am not sure about that. You mentioned gold earlier, do you enjoy golf?
I have played a little, I'm not very good at it, I can't say that I have the hand-eye coordination to do it well and I'm terrible at it with regards to hand-Eye coordination, and I don't have the patience for a proper course haha. I know that golf courses in America are so good, Rhode Island and Delaware combined have more golf courses than Rhode Island AND Rhode Island combined.
It is a waste of land, golf courses are in more courses than the rest of the world combined and it seems like that is not even golf courses, but just waste of time.
That's a lot of excess. There's a course in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water daily. I wonder how that's possible? An average American gold course only consumes a fraction of that. I'm pretty sure the US consumes a lot more than the UAE course in dubai that requires 6,000,000 gallons.
That is a huge waste.  It's horrible that it is drinkable water that is used.
Hi, how are you?
Hello, I'm great! How about you?
I'm good, thanks.  Do you like football?
I like watching, but I guess it depends how much I am playing lol, I like playing more than watching
I do.  The games are usually kind of long to watch though. The last super bowl I watched was like three hours long.  I think the last one was about 11 hours long!  That was the last super bowls I watched.
I think it's weird that there is only 11 min of game play, that seems really weird.
It makes me mad! LOL. That is a lot of wasted time standing around.
Yeah, a lot of time!
I know right!  Do you have a favorite team?
I do not. Did you know that in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as football players?
I hate the New England Patriots.  I know a lot of folks despise them and I think they are the team that a lotof folks despise.  LOL  I like the team.  How much do you think bowlers used to make?  I grew up bowling and I watched them on TV watching paint dry.
No I wont hate on you, I follow football religiously and I like the team that cheats lol no worries I will not hate on the team of the teamthat cheats LOL
Lol, hey there are a lot of good players, there is a running back Benjarvis Green who never fumbled in his career, and Ellis never fumbles either, so there are good players.
I read that, he doesnt play for the patriots anymore but that is so impressive,  thats gotta be a record or something,  he must have a record if that is how it is,  I know he doesnt have the record of the Patriots anymore,
I heard they got him for one of those chips the nfl puts in the player's shoulder pads.
Yeah,  crazy,  that is a good idea,  they use technology to help track stats,  lol good idea.  Yeah,  thats crazy.
They use the chips in the balls, the info is in a searchable database, and then the chips are in the chips too
I'm not sure, I wonder if it is public or something?
Yeah, and interesting how they can get data from there, I think. Do you have any favorite players?
Hmmm Google is very interesting, I wonder if it has the opponents names and their opponents?
lol, kind of like how with high tech spying, your bank account info would be tighter than your bank's info, and vice versa,  and you'd have your data locked up, and your bank data locked away.  lol
LOL, fair game.  Well it was great talking to you, have a good one!
Hi do you like watching football?
I watched a little of the superbowl and the SB. You?
I always watch football on the second Sunday of February because I like to party.  I wanted to go to the superbowl this year because I wanted the whole party. I like the first sunday of February, when you can watch football.
Nice.  Well, I'll talk to you later, coworkers and friends.  The lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than lifetime earnings for the average NFL player.  I wonder why?  The average earnings of the average engineer ishigher than the lifetime earnings that the average nfl player gets.
That's surprising. In the 1960s, top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars.
I'm surprised that the top 3 football players make more money than bowlers, but not surprised.
Yeah, people seem to really love their football.  There are only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.  I wonder how many minutes of living gameplay per team is actually live.
Americans love NFL games, especially with 32 teams divided equally between NFC and AFC, with the teams divided entirely between NFC
I didn't know that.  I do know that the technology is awesome.  The shoulder pads and balls have trackers.  Football has come a long way.
Yes, the NFL uses tracking chips to record every move by players.
That's pretty neat. The footballs track rotation, velocity, ball speed and location. It's pretty cool.
That is neat, I wonder how teams can strategize their games around it.
I wonder if the NFL will ever have women playing?  They have no explicit rules against female players, but the NFL has no explicit rule against female playing.
No rule against it, so maybe women are interested in joining American football teams, but I wonder if there is a rule against certain type of football. Unlike soccer, which is more physical, I think women are interest in joining american football.
Some NFL players have some incredible talent. Bejarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his NFL career and he is one of the few NFL players to do so.
That is incredible.  I read that somewhere.
Me too. Do you like baseball?
I do, but I think it's boring. I've watched world series before, but not the last few. Have you?
I never have either. I saw that the women's world cup had higher TV ratings than the world series.
I'm glad that it is, I feel bad for my friend, I'm sure she is not alone.
Do you like baseball? I like to watch it in person but I don't really watch it as a sport because it doesn't have the same atmosphere as a person.
Do you follow football?  There are a total of 32 teams, but only two teams in the US.
I dont really, I am more of a baseball fan, I think its interesting that women are technically allowed to participate, I dont think they would be able to though,
Yea, I wonder if they will have a female place kicker in the NFL one day since there is no rule against them playing since there has never been one. I wonder where they can get a female kicker or a female QB since there isn't a rule against it
I bet she would kick butt! I know that New Orleans cheerleaders are able to go out to dinner with any NFL player and they have to take a shame.  I wonder if they get to have dinner with an NFL player.
Yea that rule forbidding cheerleader's from having the same place as football players is outdated and sexist
I agree with you.  Pretty funny that U of Iowa painted their visitor locker room pink.
Yea, Iowa must be trying to psych out the visiting team,  I wonder why they do that?  I don't know why they would want pink locker rooms lol
I dont know about football, but that is ridiculous.  Do you know the highest game score ever in football?
Yea that is awful, Georgia Tech is typically a good team but Cumberland was just awful
That's funny, I like baseball!  I like the cubs,  funny that they win the series back to back but then never won again lol.  Did you know they didn't even win the Series back toBack!
I like it, it's great to watch.  It's crazy babe ruth was caught stealing in game 7 of the 1926 world series and got a beer.
hey when youre trying to run,  you gotta do what you gotta to.  That didnt work for him lol
Bad decisions to steal home since babe was only 5 feet away, but light off to far!
True.    I mean, what else could possibly go wrong?   Could be bad enough to have marines carrying a Canadian flag upside down like that?
The marines corps should not have done that.  They should have kept the Blue Jays heads on.
Ohh, that would be clever. Yeesh! One thing is for sure, weve been waiting for that since the Cubs last won in 2016.  YeesH!  The Cubs have been around since the Ottoman empire and the Ottoman Empire!
That's pretty crazy. The Cubs were the first team to win back to back World Series. They were also the first and only team to won back to BACK World Series
Yes, it amazes me that they won both in 2016 and 2017.  They have never been close before that.
Yea, they have won more world series than they have not, that is crazy.
I heard that the Fall Classic is also referred to as the Fall classic.  Have you heard of it?
Nice chatting with you. Thanks.
Hi, how are you?
I'm good thanks! How are you?
I am good, I wasn't feeling well today.  I was just reading about foot ball, did you know about that?
Yeah same here, I'm trying to watch the super bowl but it is pretty boring so far.
I'm not a huge fan of football. I only watch in passing and not a big fan of the SB. What about you?
I like watching in the bowl. Apparently there is no written rule that women can't play in the Bowl, but there is a written rule
I dont think there is any rule that woman cant play, do you?
no, i think that would change the dynamic of the game. It would be interesting though.
It would be interesting, but it would be difficult with peoples own morals and such.  There are a lot of men who would want to hit a woman on the field.
Apparently they have added tracking chips in the players, and in the pads as well, they have also added tracking Chips to the pads.
They do? what are they doing with them?
They track and record moves and everything. It is just like watching drones play the game.
That would be interesting. I bet they could use the screen replays where thye use markers.
Probably, considering that the average game only has 11 minutes of live game play.
I think the rest of it is ads.
I'm not sure, I'm not really sure.
Did you see what they did at half time this year?  It was ridiculous!
No, I didn't watch that, what about you?
It wasnt very good,  blah,  I feel the only good superbowl half time was Katy Perry,  how did you feel about that?
haha ya I didn't like that, also the university of Iowa's visiting locker room is painted pink!
I wonder if they do it because of breast cancer or if that is just intimidation!
It is for intimidation.  I am not sure.
Funny how it came about.  Do you like color, or just color?
In the 1960s top bowlers made twice as much as top NFL football players.
That's a bit crazy.  I wonder why bowlers made money?  I know bowling isn't that old, I've never been bowling.
Well I got to go, nice talking to you
Do you enjoy football?  I really do.  Do you like it?
I love NFL!  How about you?
I love football as much as I love watching NFL. I used to play pickup football all the time, but not so much anymore. I still play with friends and family all theTime, but I am not playing as much anymore, I love football. Do you know there is no rule against women playing football in the NFL? There is no such rule against men.
I did not know that, I wonder if they could play lol, do they have to use the ball or something?
I'd love to see more women try out. I wonder if anyone will be able to pass the eligibility requirements. I'd like to see Tom Brady try out!
Did you know that the University of Iowa's visitor locker room is actually pink.
True, that would make the opposing team feel emasculated. I bet that New Orleans cheerleaders have to leave if an NFL player comes in to eat in the restaurant and the cheerleaders leave if they are already there. I wonder if an nfl player has to leave, too. It would make them feel em asculated.
I didn't know that! Did you know the first NFL player was female?
True, but the rule sounds pretty misogynistic, if not for the male cheerleader.
I wonder about that too. Did you know ESPN invented the yellow line?
I did not know that, but it makes sense since it shows up on TV shows so it makessense.  I think it is weird that they got an Emmy for it.
I think so.  Georgia Tech won one for best TV show I guess!
That's crazy! And the average game only lasts 11 minutes in actual live gameplay. That's insane!
Cumberland was the only losing team in the 4th quarter and they were on the losing team!
Imagine being on the other team and realizing that's where you are.  Imagine trying to think of their biggest defeat in the history of the team and not even being able to name the one.
Did you know in the 60's pro bowlers made more than football players?
Wow, that's odd considering what they make today.  Engineers make more over the lifetime than the average NFL player.  That seems odd.  I would invest more into my education, but then again engineers make more than the Average NFL player over a lifetime.
Yes I heard that, but I think it is also misleading because the average NFL career is only about 5 years old lol, you don't have time to find a career after that, so maybe that can be misleading for the average nfl career,
That's a fair point. I'm a big Giants fan and have been to a few past Super Bowls, but I don't like the Patriots, but the Giants accidentally scored a touchdown on the Patriots and the Giants mistakenly scored a TD on the patriots
I hate the Patriots. The Giants are the lannisters of the NFL, but I can't hate them. They beat them alleged cheaters every time. That's amazing.
Yeah I heard you hate Bill Belichick, but I also heard that the author of Game of Thrones called him the winningest coach in NFL postseason, and the winningEST coach in nfl postseason.
Yeah, I don't care for him, he's the back up to the Browns haha. I just hope he doesn't take over the Browns again, they don't seem to care.
He belongs with the Browns. He should go back to the Browns and do what he belongs to do.
hi, how are you?
Did you know that the NFL could be at the end of its days, maybe?
I know, there are so many scandals and issues, people are not counting it out.
I think the NFL has its problems, but I don't think the players will ever be as much of a problem as the NCAA. The NFL is much better than the NCAA
I think that's valid, but if one person quits or the person wants to go to another sport, then that's the place for them.  There's always a player waiting to play, but there aren't that many players who want to move on from the sport.
The fans would get bored with it too.  People want the quality of the game and the fans, not the quality as a whole.
True.  Fans are fickle, and it runs in cycles.  I liken it to a losing team selling out an empty stadium instead of winning.  The views are important, but the views of the losing team are important to the team sellingout an empty arena, so it is likely true.
I think letting women in the game would create interest from many fans and I think letting them play in the games would create Interest.
Absolutely. I wonder if they will butcher it like the NHL did when Manon Reheaume played. The concern is that they mishandled the "gimmick" that was given to her, so if Manon reheaume plays for the NHL, she will butcher them like a butcher.
Yes, that is true, but I wonder how long term it would help if women stay in it at this point.  I think it would be better if women stayed out for the long term.
I feel like there are some very talented women athletes out there. Like there's been a woman kicker, a wide receiver, and a woman Kickers.
Women would have to win the super bowl. That would be tough. I would like to see a coach like Bill Belichick hire a woman, but I'm not sure if it will be the coach that can win the Super Bowl.
Sorry for sounding bad, I meant from the perspective of generating revenue and views.  It's not like the sponsors would love the coverage, but the front office and the sponsors wouldn't.  I mean, the sponsors have the perspective, but it's not the sponsors themselves.  From the perspective Of generating revenue, I don't think it's worth it.
I see your strategic point of view.  The sponsors would tie her presence to a bunch of social issues and products.  I think Belichick probably does it just to get her in the post season.  He probably wants to see how the sponsors would Tie Her to a whole bunch ofSocial Issues and Products.
Absolutely.  I think he's looking at it from a angle that would guarantee an extra $1,000,000 if they win.  He could be paid to do that.  Who would have thought that the guy would hire a green martian to be his Belichek?  He would get paid to win, that's for sure.
Maybe. I wonder how Tom Brady and Belichick would react to a woman in the huddle? I wonder if a woman could be in the Huddle. I think Tom Brady would react the same way.
I'm a huge fan of Brady and the combo, but I don't think I would be a huge user of Brady in that scenario in the first place. It's a professional way to adapt to a new scenario in a very professional way.
I do wonder if he's jealous of the revenue sharing that the male players get from the coverage they get and how much they make.  Male players don't seem to care about that, they just want to make more for the media coverage.
I think it will gradually become a normal thing. It happened in NASCAR when Danica Patrick joined. They will adapt and it will become a regular thing.
Wow, that's awesome.  I wonder if male players were a bit hesitant to smash her hard, though.  The NFL is known for their violence.  Male players are a bit more hesitant to Smash her.
True, but they adjust to the whole thing so they will adjust.
Do you watch football?  I like it.
Yes I do. I am a New England Patriots fan!
I am lol. Did you know that women are allowed to play football? There is no written rule against female players.
No rule allowing female players?  I am not a fan of the Patriots, I watch football more for the Patriots myself.  I'm not surprised there is no rule allowing females play tho.  lol
I know. George rr martin calls the Patriots the lannisters of football lol.
Haha, that's hilarious. I agree with George RR Martin, that is hilarious. The highest scoring game in football was 222-0, that blows my mind.
Yeah thats pretty crazy, that must have been a devasting loss!
I cant imagine being on a losing team, I can't even fathom any team scoring 222 points tho. Can you imagine being a losing teams scoring 222 pts?
I hope they never suffer that embarrassing moment again lol, I think they should have to do training before the game, I hope they can do better in training for the next game
Haha I hope too. I was surprised that ESPN won an Emmy for creating the yellow line representing the first down line. I had no clue!
I didnt know that either, cool!  I know the NFL uses tracking chips on the players.
Wow, a lot of science and tech are involved in the game.
Yeah technology has contributed a lot to that but I think it's all the people at home who can draw on the screen and light up the parts.  My teacher was a science teacher.  I heard that the physics behind some of the fancy stuff, but he had people who were really into lightening the way.
Yea, I heard that too, very interesting. I wonder what kinds of things he did? Hard to believe NFL players gets paid so much, but NFL engineers make more over their lifetime than some of the players. That must be hard to believe, considering how much the viewers at home, the viewers, get to see and see the players, but the engineers make way more.
It really is a ridonkulous amount of money, I think I would rather be an engineer, and also I think they would have less injuries lol, and I think bowlers used to make more than NFL football players lol, but they make more now than NFL players and also have less injury injuries than NFLFootball players lol
Haha yea I would rather be an engineer than a bowlers,  I wonder why that is,  wow!
I guess football wasnt very popular back then lol!
I guess not.  My grandparents were all bowlers haha and they always brought home trophies and a little cash tho.  I wonder if they brought home cash tho?
That's not a lot of trophies! My dad was always in a league but it was never very fun. My grandparents are big into bowling too, and they had a lot, but not a whole lot of prizes.
That is cool. I thought it was for fun that you were bowling.
lol  Its been good chatting!
Hello, do you watch football?
Yes I do.  I like the game, the action in a game is only a minute, so you can see the action for only a few minute.
Yeah, it takes a long time, and it's all ads that makes me angry, so much ads that's why!
There are so many kinds of football, do you like soccer or rugby more?
I like both, soccer is my favorite. I like rugby the best. What about you?
I like both, I've played soccer since I was young and it's still fun to me to watch soccer or play it, I don't watch Soccer when it's televised but I have never seen it live.
i used to play it. i don't watch it as much as football telivised. do you have a favorite team?
Yeah I like the New England Patriots.  I live about 100 miles from the nearest team so I think it's great that so many people like them.  Where do you live?
My favorite team is the NFL, but I like the author of Game of Thrones reffer to his favorite team as the Lanisters... funny how the author is the author  of Game Of Thrones, lol I wonder if that means they are the lanisters of the NFL
That's a good thing or a bad thing.  I don't follow games of thrones.  Do you?
It is not a bad thing, but it is cruel.  The show has a powerful family and a powerful and powerful family is a badthing.
It is kind of fitting, they are the football dynasty.
They share the record for Superbowl losses with the team that has the most superbowl losses, with the other team that had the most Superbowls won.
They should honor Bill Belichick, he is a legendary coach.  When he retires he will be a legendary Coach.
I bet he is, he is the winningest coach of the postseason, and the hall of fame.  I hope he stays on the team or goes into the hall, but I bet he will go into the Hall of Fame.
I guess coaches are made to be remembered, not forgotten, they should retire his number in the stadium in honor of him, I guess coaches can be given a stadium in memory of them
That's kind of sad. He was a good coach but a bad coach, he didn't do well as the head of the team. I know he didn's paly terribly, and he was a bad head coach.
Another thing that bothers me about the Patriots is that they name Gillette Stadium after the owner of the Patriots.  That seems kind of tacky.  Do you know if you know who the Gillette's are?
I agree. I think the stadium is too expensive for what it is, and it looks like it.
Yeah Gillette must pay a lot. The Patriots have the most money of all the players, but the average NFL player doesn't make as much money as they should. In his time an engineer will earn more in his life, while the average nfl player will only earn about 5x as much.
That is a suprising stat since football players earn tons of cash, and I'm sure the engineer works for years, but it is a sure thing since the football players earning tons of money.
Do you follow football much?  It can refer to rugby or soccer, depending on the country and the name depending, depending if it's in the US or elsewhere.
I love NFL football. How about you?
Me too,glad espn invented the yellow first down line for games, makes watching much better
Did you know ESPN won Emmy's for it?
Yea that is pretty cool, and kinda funny that an average of 11 minutes of gameplay for a 2 hour football game is only 11 minutes, that is kinda funny to think that there was only 11.30 minutes of game
I know. 14 out of the 25 largest stadium belong to college football
That's funny that the University of Iowa's stadium is on that list, I wonder who painted the visitors locker room pink?  They do that sometimes, they painted theVisitors locker room blue at University Iowa Stadium.
I wonder why they did that? Is it because of a rule? I wonder if there will ever be a female playing there? There are only 2 females who have ever been in pink.
There are no rules against female players in the NFL, there is actually a female placekicker in the nfl and I wonder if there will ever be a female player
I'm not sure.  Do you mean in college or Canadian?
I think it would be a college called Cumberland, they lost to Georgia Tech but it is a college.
wow that was lucky for the Patriots that happened a longtime ago.
I am a big patriot fan, the lannisters of the NFL, I think the lAnnisters are the best,
I think they cheated theRaiders out of the tuck rule and also underinflated balls. I wonder if they recorded others practices as well.
 Belichick is considered the coach with the most post season wins in history.  21 post season winning and 21 post game wins.
Belichick coached the Browns.
Yea and Belichick even won a postseason game with the Browns, the last one in 1995
I think he is the only team to ever have a playoff win.
I know, crazy!  He lost to the Bills and Patriots in the super bowls and has lost to them in all 3 super bowls.
I know, right?  I wonder how many points are the wins and losses by?
Nice chatting with you! I have to get going.
Hello! Who is your favorite football team?
Hey there!  I like the Dallas Cowboys!  How about you?  What about you, how about yourself?
Did you know the highest score ever in a football game happened in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222-0?
Holy cow! That is a high score! That was scoring everytime they touched the ball!
I'll never forget that game. I bet Cumberland University did too haha.
I bet not.I've heard the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player is lower than it was when they played.  I'd rather be an engineer or a player.
That is interesting. In addition, in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars in the US, in addition to that.
Football is such a fun sport.  Makes me wonder if it makes it a fun game for people because of its low pay and the injury rate.  I mean, football has a low pay but also a high injury rate!
Yeah, not sure,did you know that the university of Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely pink?
Hahaha! lol that is hilarious and such an awesome thing for them to do.
Ahaha, that is funny,I know, right?
Bill Belichick of the Patriots is the winningest NFL postseason coach.
Yeah, he has 21 wins.  Did you know the author of games of thrones called the new england patriots the nfl lannisters, what is the author from games of Thrones called the New england Patriots the NFL Lannisters?
Eww, incest galore.
I know right, no excuse for anything!
Did you know in Game of Thrones, that the Lannister reference is to the blood line of his family was incestual.  So, he is not pure.  The Lannister's name means "pure".
I don't understand. Did you know that New orleans saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as NFL players?
That is crazy! I think that is sexist. There is a rule in the NFL that females can't even play if they are under the age of 18. That is crazy.
Yeah, I didn't know that. Nice talking to you
Same to you! Thanks!
bye! :)  :) 
Hi there how are you today? Do you follow football?
Good, thanks.  I like football.  Do you watch it?
I watch playoffs and the Super Bowl.  Did you know that an average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay?
OMG! I swear, the last superbowl I watched lasted three hours and the one before that I watched last Superbowl I watched lasts three hours. It was wasted time!
Yeah and the joint between the super bowl and the halftime show really stinks!  I'm sure it's not joint for the women's only super bowl halftime show.  There is no rule against female players in the NFL, but the league's eligibility requirements don't allow them.  I wonder how many women would be able to play if they could go through the league eligibility requirements?  There are only 11 female players on the NFL right now.
As long as they watch those linebackers, I think it would liven things up, but I would still rather watch those linebacker
I would too, especially since a linebacker has to play for the NFL and there is no punishment.  If they need to play, they can play in the NFL.
That would be a good idea. It could be a very good deterrent.  The NFL also uses chips in the players shoulder pads to keep all the data they collect from it. I wonder if that is a good deterrent too.
I am not sure, but player safety is important and I think it helps predict injuries and maybe strategy.
True.    The chip in the football detected a " concussion" when the New England Patriots deflated a football.  I believe that was because of Deflategate.  The Patriots had a chip in their football detected.
I think it would be funny to see if they could detect if the ball had a wobble or a flight of its own or something.  I wonder if it would just wobble like the ball?
LOL  Did you hear about the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders?  They have a rule that if an NFL player comes into the restaurant while they are eating their meal, they have to leave.  It's pretty rough, I wonder why they have a right to leave?  I mean, if they're eating in the same restaurant as an NFL Player and he comes in, they should just leave...
That's crap. I would avoid that situation. Cheerleaders are paid badly. I wonder if there are tracking chips that they put on them to help them avoid that.
Hey, nowadays everything is being tracked. Man, I know football is on for weeks but football is so far from my brain that I don't even think I could know what it is. Hey, they tracked my first born so man, he's probably been tracked.
I have been busy, too. I thought they were going to get won but I haven't been following sports recently because I have been too busy. Something fishy going on.
lol, I never knew that.  I like that goat Tom Brady, he can save us all.  He knew how to save himself though.
He is clutch, the guy is the only one consistently able to do it consistently.  I figure Bill must understand football better than a coach.  He is the coach.
Belichick is the winningest coach in NFL postseason football as well as the winningEST coach in the association as a "goat" in the matchup of the "stars aligned" - he is the GOAT.
True! Great chat, thanks for the chat!
Great chatting with you as well!  Enjoy the rest of your day!
Have a great day too!
You too!  I am going to go look into this!
Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You !
Hi!  Do you like football?  Do I follow the Chiefs?
I love football, Ronaldo, Messi and Lewandowski are gods, I think
Patrick Mahomes rocks! Nick Saban is one of the best QB's in the NFL and he might win a championship soon!
I'm not too familiar with him, is he any good?
I read that he was offered the coaches' job as the Alabama coach and people are rumoring that he may go with the Giants.  He would be the second Alabama coach to have been offered the coach's job.
I wonder if he would play for the coach or just coach.
I am not sure, he has been a coach at Alabama for years and now he is coaching at a college level. There's apparently a big difference between the college and the NFL, college players have to put up with much more rigors in order to get to the NFL and they put up a big Difference at that level.
It sounds like a dream come true for him, what do you think?
It does.  Lots of people would jump at the chance to do that, and if you can get to the pros, you should pay to go.  So if you have the chance, go for it.
I would think so!  I would think it would be more.
I am a Pats fan, and last year Tom Brady was the guy to beat!  I think he was the best QB of the post season, and Bill Belichick is the winningest coach ever in the postSeason and he is a Pats QB.  He is the guy!  Do you know who the winningEST coach is?
Naah, I know Tom Brady,  he is really good.
He is pretty good, he has won the Superbowl 8 times in the last 20 years and he is due to retire in a few years, he is also won 6 AFC East titles so he is prettyGood.
He's going to finally do it! I'm tired of hearing about it. He and his wife are a model, too.
Yes, they are a power couple!  Do you watch game of thrones?  The author called the Pats the Lannisters of the NFL, and the author calledthe Pats the lannisters of The NFL.
LOL!  Yeah I heard about that,  thats funny!  I think they are trying to pay their debt!  lol
I'm not sure.  Did you know bowlers made twice as much as top football stars in the 1960s?
I did not know that. Was bowling that popular then?
It was.  I know ESPN won an emmy for creating the superimposed "1" line for the first big deal with the line, amazing!
That was good for espn!  Hey, I heard about it!  Good for them!  Nice chatting with you!
Same here! You too!
Have a great day!  Thanks!
Do you think the NFL will ever have female players?
I think it would be great, I think it is great that there are more girls in general in the league.
That would be awesome, but I think they should still be able to have their team's archaic rule of not permitting cheerleaders in the same restaurant as the players.
I had heard about that rule, but I don't think I heard about it before.  I think we should get that rule removed.  To be honest, it sounds so dumb, but they do that all the time.  It just sounds so stupid.
The Saints are not good enough in the league to do that, though.
Yeah I agree, what do you think about the average actual time of gameplay in an average NFL game, I know that it's only 11:05, but I wonder how much of an average actual game is actually played in an game
I heard it is only 11 minutes, I think. I know we were talking about the chips in the shoulder pads. I think the players get used to talking to each other in the first 10 minutes.
Yeah, it is interesting that there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay, and the rest is spent calling plays and moving chains and stuff.
That is bizarre. I wonder if they will ever add in the time in between to add in all the time we are on the field. I know in highschool it was 11 minutes per quarter.
I think it is, I think the clock runs out in real time so the actual time of the playing is short, but the other stuff is not.  I think it's just the actual actual time that the game is playing.
I never knew that, I wonder why the tracking chips are in the balls, I never knew there were any.
I hope they can use the tracking technology to help improve player safety.
I hope they do. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow line?
That is pretty wild, but they do a lot for making the games more exciting.
My son is a Game of Thrones fan.  It's hilarious that the author likened the Patriots to the Lannisters.  The author likened
Yes, that is hilarious!  How funny!
I think it's a great intimidation move.  I wonder why they did not paint the U of IA visitor's locker room pink?  I thought that would be a great way to paint the opponent while still providing much needed ambiance.
That is funny. I guess it calms people down. I don't know. It makes sense to put a different color on the opposing teams locker room. But I guess you can't put anything in your own locker room that you wouldn't put on the other teams lockerRoom. I think that's why it makes sense that they would do it.
lol that would annoy me.  I thought it was interesting that they make a name for it.  Did you realize that top bowlers used to be better football players?  I didn't realize that.  Interesting and I thought football players were better.
That is interesting. It goes to show you just how big the NFL has become, I think.
It really has.  Do you know how much engineers make?  I didn't know engineers make so much!
I wonder if that takes into account how long their careers are compared to pro sports players? The average career is only 5.5 years, so maybe that takes account howLong their careers last?
I see your point.  Thanks for chatting with me, have a great day, kids!
Hi, there!  Do you like football?  I like the chat menu.
Hey I do like it I heard about the highest scoring football game of all all time haha, I think that was the highest scored football game ever
Georgia Tech! That is cruel. What was the coach thinking?
I agree. I would have quit if it was me haha. It was Cumberland that day though. I felt so bad for the guy that was hit.
I hope the coach put the second string on first. Cumberland was the team that was going to beat anyone. Who scheduled that game. Who would have scheduled that games?
I agree. Have you heard of Benjarvus Green-Ellis from the Patriots? Apparently, he's awesome because he never fumbled the ball for the Patriots!
That is an astonishing feat. I hope he gets a raise or bonus from them for that!
That is amazing. I don't watch football on television, but I like watching it on TV. Apparently ESPN created the line that shows you when you won an emmy for best tv show for watching. That's cool, and apparently ESPN created that line, amazing!
I do, I like the superimposed graphics, I thought it was the station started it, but I do not know how they came up with it.
ya I don't know, I think it was a technological achievement back then haha, did you know there are no females in the NFL, I don's if they qualify? I wonder if they could play in the nfl, I can't see how females would be able to qualify
No, but I guess that means they have to be big, strong, and fast.
Yeah I think they probably will, I wonder if there will be a female NFL player someday, I also wonder how long they will play in the games, apparently the actual games only last 11 minutes, I don't think a female nfl player someday would ever get to see live gameplay lol that is too long for one game!
Probably because it is the perfect sport for television. Lots of time for commercials, lol.
haha, what do you think about the NFL? I think it's fair and it does make me sad though that the cheerleaders aren't treated well in the NFL, apparently they have to leave if a player walks in a restaurant eating, and they have no way to leave, it doesn't seem fair to me and it doesn's make me want to leave a restaurant if a football player walks into a restaurant.
Yeah, it does.  There is a lot of sexism in the league and I think it is something that will probably change very slowly.  Things change very Slowly, but yeah.
I agree! The Patriots did well this year and I was happy that they won the Superbowl this year. I like the Patriots.
I am!  I wanted to see the Patriots winnin' but I wanted my other team to be the underdog - they were!
Haha I do too! I like the Patriots a lot. I watch Game of Thrones a lot too! Apparently the author of that show thinks the Patriots are the Lannisters, the bad guys of the show lol. That is really funny, and apparently the author also thinks the NFL is the Lannister's of the NFL.
LOL, yeah, the pats are the Lannisters, the Lannister are the Pats...lol. Anyway, great chat!
Great chat enjoy your night! I wonder why they didn't make it to the SB this year lol, I want Bill Belichick to remain as the winningest coach of the Patriots next year lol.
Have a good night!  Thanks!
You too!  I'm going to go see the Gillette Stadium next time the Patriots play again btw.
Do you like football? I like it.
Hi there! I don't really watch football. I just watch it sometimes. LOL Thanks for the chat!
LOL me too, I like to watch but I'm always finding new ways to get infos about it or new infos to look up.
I learned so much from these chats in my ten years of watching football, lol.
I didn't know that in the 60s top bowlers made more money than football players.
I didn't know that. i bet the players didnt have a union then like they do now back then. Pro football has a union now, but I bet the player's didnt.
No, it was a good time for bowlers I guess, not a goodtime for bowlering, too many injuries.
yeah, they have a longer career and probably a longer careers, football players dont have long careers. they might get a bad injury or two, but they have it all.
I agree.  I've found that most of them that are in the NFL or NBA retire within the first 5 years.  Only about 7% of those who go bankrupt after 5 years are in NFL or nba retire.
That is terrible.  I know that those guys that are in the league are probably not managing money well,  they dont have careers or enough earnings.  If they dont survive they are out of the league.
Yeah true, they should teach them how to do that.
It seems like it would be a skill you would need for coaching jobs.  I guess it would take skill.
lol, that's a skill, but I think it's better for a sports announcer, that would be a skill.
yeah, those guys have played sports all their lives and dont know what to do with themselves. they should get jobs like that, they know what they want.
I mean a running back once was a runningBack who never fumbled the ball in his career, that's amazing
That guy is for the Patriots, what an accomplishment for the record books.
I hope that guy is not still on the Patriots, I dont want to hear about him, I think the Patriots are being accused of cheating, I hope that man is not accused of cheat, I sure dont.
Yeah, I think cheating scandals are bad for the Bill, but they live on...
I hear he puts Tom Brady on the injured list every week and hes on the list since 2007, I hear he put him on the inactive list every WEEK and hes never on it.
 Bill is crying wolf, but that wont work with the team, so he does the trick to his team. It is like a trick he has. Anyway, great chat!
Great chat! Thank you!
Good morning!  Did you know the NFL has no official rule against female players?
No, I have never heard that before..  I wonder if any of these women will ever make the NFL one day.
I don't know.  I also don't think the cheerleaders of the Saints are even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the cheerleading.
In the NFL there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay, do you know why?
I don't like it because I like more of a reaction, more ads, more commentary and less reaction these days, too much commentary and too much ads.
I know, I know.  It's not as popular as it was in the 1960s when top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.  In the NFL, in the 60's the top bowler's made twice what the top football players did.  The NFL has come a long way over the years.
It is hard to imagine bowling being as popular to watch as it was in the 60s.  Most sports televised are either a pay based on live attendance or a pay-as-you-go pay based based onlive spectator, or they are not popular enough to live spectator.  It is hard for me to imagine that bowling would be so popular with live attendance.
I think bowling was televised.  My dad told me that.  I would watch it when I could.
Fascinating, I didn't know that.  It was televised and the pay was based on the ratings.  I wonder how much higher than football was and how much more pay wasBased on TV ratings.
I'm not sure!  I know today, engineers earn more than NFL players.  They make more over their lifetime than the average of the NFL players on the average.  Engineers earn more, on average, than the NFL's
That would be interesting to know. I think it would help if a football player could have a background to transition to. Sadly, sadly, a lifetime career as a footballplayer is a lifetime of injuries and you don't get the income to start a new career after you retire from the fields or suffer from injuries that would limit you from coaching. It would be more interesting to see if they could get into coaching or something else to have that background after they retire.
Amazing how much technology we have in the NFL these days, amazing.
Yes, I was reading about the chips that are in the shoulder pads. I hope the data they gather is used to prevent injuries. I would hope thedata they gather from those chips will help prevent injuries as well.
I think it's interesting how espn won an emmy for that yellow line they created for the yellow line.
It's very simple, the yellow line, and the Emmy was only awarded for the simple one.
I know.  I think it is really helpful to view football.
It really is a simple thing but can make a huge difference, one simple thing can make such a huge change
I wish I had some of the inventions of the Patriots that are so simple!
I like the Pats, I have been to games at their Gilllette Stadium, have you seen any of their games?
Bill Belichick and the Patriots have the most wins in NFL postseason with 21 wins. Only one other QB with more wins in nfl postseason: Cleveland Browns.
That's a great team, great team!  Its been good talking to you, have a great day!
Hi! Do you watch the NFL?
Yes, I do.  I know the NFL is the National Football League, right?
Yeah, I watch it every once in a while.
I do, I didn't get to a chance to watch much TV in my house growing up, television was forbidden in my House growing up.
OMG! Yeah, that is so weird.
I guess it has been an influence on our childhoods, I guess in my mind, like NFL football is also an influence in our childhood,
It's interesting to watch when you're at the bar. I usually drink beer, though.
It is an alcoholic event, I guess, so there's shouting and cheering and whatnot.  It's a bunch of teams with a bunchof teams and a few players.  Who's your favorite team or player?  Do you have a favorite team?
Yup, it is lots of fun and a good time.  I think the Redskins are a great team to follow.  They are a really great team and I have a goodtime with them.
The Redskins are actually named after all the native Americans who are named after the Redskins.
Yeah that is right they have been a team for a long long time now, since 1946, so they are the first team
I know that they mock the American Indians and the Redskins when they do not play the Redskins.
I think so, I'm not sure. I wonder what he was named after. I know he was born over 100 years ago, he was actually named after someone born in 1700
I thought it was because they are American, but the team in Washington, the Patriots, is the only American team in DC.
Nope, it was named after someone who has been there for a long time.  naming conventions are different now, I think.
I know that Washington is a town with a lots of native peoples and the team is from Washington, DC. I guess people choose a name that suits the spirit of the town, I imagine it does.
The baseball team is named the Nationals, the Patriots are named after the team from New England, I know that the baseball team in one of the states is from New Hampshire, I wonder what the Patriots is named, I also wonder why the Patriots and not the Nationals?
I've heard that before, I think it is from New Hampshire, and I think that is why we have a state named New England.  I think New York is the only state named "New Hampshire" and "New" is the state named NY.
Interesting. To clarify, I think the state is actually New England. I know there's a region in that region but I don't know how many settlers went to New England or why it's so different.
It was an interesting lesson in the history of the patriots and the NFL football, the history is all over the place for sure.
Yeah, the NFL is fun to watch and I enjoy it. It was nice chatting with you.
Hi. Do you like the game? I hear the bears have the highest paid defensive player in the history of the game, but I don't know who the highest paying defensive player ever is.
That is amazing.  I know they were comparing Khalil Mack to Lawrence Taylor.
Taylor changed the way the game was played, I think.
Yes. He looked impressive this year. He earned the pay he received. He's the highest paid defensive player in the history of the game. He was the highest highest paid offensive player in history too.
I wonder why Iowa State Universities coach has the visiting football teams locker rooms painted pink.  Did you know that?  Iowa State University has the opposing football teamsocker rooms painted Pink?
That's a strange thing to do, speaking of football.  Speaking of football, in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top football players.  I wonder why?  In the 1960's top Bowlers made more than the top football player.
Wow, sign me up!  I can drink beer and bowl fro millions!  Hey did you know the highest scored college game ever was a college game!  The coach was a coach!
No, I do not.  What was it?
It was 1916 and the score was 220-0 in favor of Georgia Tech over Cumberland.
I can't believe that was ever a score that high.
I know right, he must have wanted to get that buss ride home!
Ha! Just kidding!  ESPN won an Emmy for the creation of the yellow line that marks the first down line on the screen.  Can you imagine if someone didn't have that line?  I mean, ESPN won it for the yellow lines on the line that Marks the firstdown line on a screen.
That thing made life more manageable! Well deserved! lol. The Patriots have never fumbled the football in their career and they never fumbles it once!
Really, that is amazing! I didn't know that. I remember when he had his chance, but I can't remember if it was ever.
Benjarvus Green-Ellis former Patriot, right?
Speaking of the Patriots, do you remember when they first became the Patriots?  I remember that when George RR Martin called them the Lannisters of the NFL.  I wonder if that was a compliment or something?
Wow, the number of losses for the Patriots is not that common, but the number to the Buffalo bills and the number in the Super Bowl is the same, only one of them has a number of wins and one of the number with a number on it, the Buffalo Bills are the only two to never go to the Super bowl
Wow. I didn't realize it was tied for losses, but I think everyone talks about how they're tied for wins and not wins, but that is not what I think.
The Cleveland Browns last play-off game was in 2016.
That's a long time, that was awful!  What year was that?  Was that before or after the year that was so awful?
Lol, well it is a lucrative career for sure.  Bowling is also a lucrative Career.  Well I have to go hear what they are saying now.  It was nice talking to you!
Hi there! Are you a football fan? I have been discussing football with you a bit recently, but I have never been much of one.
I'm a skins fan, grew up a skins Fan, so I don't mind it.
I like the bay area teams.  I watch games but mostly watch the playoffs and the super bowl.  Do you watch games during the playoffs?
Are you a patriots fan?
no, I like the underdog, I always root for the underdog in the game
I like pro football LOL.  George R.R Martin called the Patriots "the Lannisters of the NFL."  I wonder why he called the patriots that?
I guess he thought they were the bad guys.
I wonder if that would make the Buffalo Bills better than the Patriots? The Bills have 21 Superbowl wins but 2 superbowl losses.  The Patriots have 20 Superbowl losses and only 1 with the Starks.
Yeah, the Bills have definitely suffered a lot from that Superbowl, it's frustrating to see the Bills always seem to lose in the superbowl, but they have suffered a whole lot.
Can you imagine?  I like the Cleveland Browns, but they are not doing well at all.
The browns have only one Superbowl, and have been to the SB 3 times, all the other times they didn't even get to the superbowl
I believe it was the Patriots and their first playoff win since then.
That's a shame.  I guess the fans must be frustrated because they want to see something different.  If only Cleveland had Lebron.
Yeah, I wonder how they lured him away.
He is a great player, but eventually everyone leaves the game at the end of their career.  I am pretty sure that Brady is the same way in basketball.  He is a very great player but at the very end, he is a QB.
Very true. I wonder who will replace Brady. I would like to see a female QB in the NFL, there is apparently no actual restriction against it.
Yeah, i dont think those guys writing the rules imagined a day where a woman would be able to play in the game. I dont know if I could do it at that level of the game, I think the guys writing those rules imagined it.
I think the officials would have to let the men race if a female plays, since they can't stop the lead and if the woman plays they could be overtaking the men. A female cyclist would have a better chance of long term earnings, since the most recent lifetime earnings of a female engineer was $123,000, but I think a great engineer would make more in the long term. I wonder who will stop the next engineer from trying to try.
Cycling is a sport that requires a lot of muscle mass, but cyclists are very thin. Football requires a LOT of muscle, but football requires more. I wonder if engineering is a better choice because of the concussions and injuries?
I think Brady has made football a religious experience.  I don't know what makes him think he will ever retire.  If he does, I'm not sure how he will fare when he does.  Brady hasMade Football a religiousExperience.
I think you just adjust to new life, build new interests, practice new hobbies, adjust to being an announcer, coach or whatever. I figure you can figure it out. Anyway, great chat!
Yes, he sure does.
Hello, do you like football? Did you watch the Superbowl on Sunday?
Yes I did watch the Super Bowl last Sunday.  I expected that I would not watch it since I'm not a fan of football, but I did.  Are you a fan?
I expected the game to be more exiting but I was happy with the taste. I am so happy that my team won. I think the defensive side of the game was the most exiting, but my team was a little under the radar.
I know, right?  I mean they were tied after the first quarter.
Yeah the game was still even till the 3rd quarter when the Pats scored a touchdown and history changed! The Pats scored  a touchdown  and history change.
13-3, that is when I stopped watching.
Yeah.  I was like you, it didn't end well for them.  Are you a football fan?  Who is your favorite team?
I do not, the team I follow is the Rams, they looked really well this year but I think Tom Brady is off the chart winning the Super Bowl, he is the best, he looks like Tom Brady from a chart winning season, he did well this season, but I like the Rams better
Yeah he was just starting to get into it, I dont know what he would do in the Steelers, but Bill Belichick is a great coach, he is one of the top NFL winners, starting with the 2000 Steelers, he has been a great Coach.
He is, I think he's insane, I hope the Patriots keep the team going strong, they've really been making big progress, they have great technique and I hope they can keep it going, great technique, I want to see the team go further, its been a while since they've done that.
I'm sure it was a great strategy. He is the winningest coach in the NFL and the only one to do so.
He sure is. Do you know who else has more wins?
The Patriots have 21 wins, the Browns have 16 remaining and the Patriots have 18 wins.
I wonder what other teams he has coached for?
Yeah he should have coached more teams, the Patriots also hold the record for super bowl losses, he should of coached more than 2 teams
I did not know that.  Who have they won since then?
Yeah, Ive always wanted to visit the Gillete Stadium, I would watch the Patriots play there one day.
The stadium is large, and the Patriots are the best, so I think they should do well. Maybe one day they will save it for the Super bowl. They will do their job and earn it.
Sounds like a solid plan.  Tickets are worth it though,  depending on the game they can be very expensive,  $100-$200,  or $300 depending on how many tickets are worth.
Very true.  I think they are very expensive.
Yeah but totally worth it, you have a great chance to go to foxborough, its only $20 so its a great opportunity
Hello, do you watch NFL?
Hello, yes I do, how about you?
I do too!  Did you know women can play as well?
Yes, I read that, cool. A female player did make a team once though, I wonder if the female player is still around
I hope so! There is only 11 minutes of active gameplay in a game.
Crazy.  I guess we are better watching tv than that I guess.
I know I am glued to the tv for hours if not minutes.  I can't even boiled down what it takes to get it down to 24 hours!
We are! I read about ESPN winning an Emmy for it, but I don't know how you can win an emmy for hours of TV time!
Yeah I did, it was for the superimposed yellow line. Strange to win an award for something you didn't even do.
That makes sense, I use the line a ton when watching the games so it is a bit strange, although it makes sense.
I guess that is why they put tracking chips on the payers too.
Yeah I read that, I think its advanced for the game, but I don't know how advanced they are
Yeah for sure.  Did you know New Orleans cheerleaders have a weird rule about not doing anything to the New Orleans?
Yeah, they had it for a year, it was just a silly outdated rule.
I hope so!  U of Iowa's locker room for visitors is painted pink.
That's hilarious.  I think it's cool,  and I wonder who got in charge of that.  Is it in charge?
Yeah me too. In the 60s bowlers made twice as much as football players.
That is wild, I guess that is back then when the top bowler was the top bowller, I wonder why that is
Go figure!  Yeah I would too.  Yeah, do you know who Benjarvis Green-Ellis is?
Yeah, he used to be a running back for the 49ers and he had only one fumble in his career!
Yeah. Do you know what the highest score ever in a football game was?
Yeah, 222-0. Crazy score! Well, it was nice talking to you, I hope you have a good night!
How do you feel about the Patriots winning another Super Bowl?
I feel like I am aggravated to be honest, I would boycott Gillette if they sponsor them, that makes me really aggravated to have to sponsor them to be frank.
I think its good. I don't hate them but I would hate to be good. Did you know Belichick is the winningest coach in post season history?
Yeah, he cheats. On the ironic side, the Patriots are tied for the most losses at super bowls with the Bills with 21 losses.
I think he might be good at thinking outside the box.  But cheating is a chance.  He tried to cheating at the end of Super Bowl 46 when he let the Giants score on their last chance and it backfired on him.  The Giants score 222 to 0.
It really did.  Bill Belichick, the coach of the Cleveland Browns, is the only coach with a playoff win for the Browns.
The last playoff win was for the Patriots?  Thats crazy!  The Browns dynasty is over now with the Patriots having had the most playoff win ever.
It is hard to believe that football is so popular and important, especially for Baker Mayfield.  Did you know that back in the 1960's bowlers made twice as much as football players?  I wonder if bowlers make more now than football players.
That is surprising, I know the average life earnings of an engineer is higher than an nfl player but the average Life earnings of a engineer isHigher than an NFL player
That is very surprising. I always assumed players would get super rich. Benjarvus Green-Ellis, a running back who has never fumbled the ball in his career, is one of the most rich.
I wonder if he used tracking chips to learn why he never fumbled. That's impressive. They use tracking chips  to learn how much they use?
I had no idea until recently that the NFL put tracking chips in players shoulder pads. It's surprising.
They use it to record everything.  I think they use it for balls, too.  It records a lot of stuff.
I heard that, but I guess I never knew Brady was cheating that time. I knew Brady had to be studying and stuff but I didn't know they knew that. In reality, there's only 11 minutes of actual game playing, and I guess that's why there's no actual game, only 11 seconds of actual gameplay.
That is crazy.  I wonder what the game time was for that game between Georgia Tech and Cumberland?  It must have been much different than the game between georgia tech and cumberland
I'm not sure. It's been a long time since I've seen the game.
I'm not sure but I think it did.  Georgia tech set the highest score ever.
Yes I bet that is a team score that will be a team's score for what seems like forever
I think Cumberland got the score, they have a mercy rule so I'm not sure what they got, pretty embarrassing for them.
I agree. What kind of score? I guess Cumberland had only one defense and no offense so I guess cumberland just had to do it on defense
The Patriots are really good right now though.
Hi, how are you? Do you like football?
I do. What about you?
Yes I do.  My favorite team is the New England Patriots, the Lannisters of the NFL.  Do you have a favorite team?  Mine is the LA Rams, but I also like the New Orleans Saints.
I like the Broncos.  I read the indentured by Ben Strauss and Joe Nocera.
I have not, but I find it interesting in some parts. I think that the NFL has peaked.
I think it is doomed, the games long-term survival.  I am a slight favorite, but I think we are doomed.
I think its doomed but I hope it gets even safer for the kids now. The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime of the MLB player.  I think it's weird that an engineer can make more than an NFL player due to brain injuries, but kids in football have the highest average lifetime lifetime earnings due to the brain injuries.  Hope that changes soon.
Wow, that seems so common. I think it's because concussions or broken bones are so common, they should put more padding on the helmets and also put more in the concussions.
Conussions are probably more frequent and more frequent, but probably underreported. The NFL is a corporate entity. A lot of these injuries aren't happening because there's only an average of 11 minutes of live gameplay. The real winners are the owners and the players, not the owners of the NFL. The injuries are likely real but under reported.
I think so too.  Did you know there are places that call different things foot ball, soccer or rugby?  I wonder what the name of the other is.
True, very true. The football game is not always high scoring though.The highest score in an american football game occurred in 1916 when Georgia Tech beat cumberland 222-0.
Probably the QB for his son's football team. Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his own son's Football team.
I did not know that. Bill Belichick has the most wins in the NFL postseason games with 21 wins. He's won 21 of them.
He is the Patriots coach right? He's the best?
Yes, he is.  He is the coaching mastermind who was able to avoid Tom Brady and Bill Belichick outsmarting the New York Giants towards the end of Super Bowl LI to avoid Brady and Belichick out Smarting them.
I know, right, I think the Patriots are like the tires on the car that have either won or lost the super bowl by 3 or 4 points in all 6 tries and have either lost the Super Bowl by 3, 4, or 5 points in every Super Bowl.
Yep, they're consistently good. Did you know that New Orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player and have to leave if an NFL player comes in?  I wonder why they have to?  They have to get up and leave if the player comes back in.
That seems really rude.  I wonder why that is?
It is kind of weird.  I don't know.  Maybe it is just because women have more problems?  The NFL has no written rules against female players.  It's kind of funny that the NFL has not written rules about female players yet.
I've heard that before.  There was a woman who went pro last year.  She was the first woman to do so.
Interesting!  Who is she?
Hi!  Are you a fan of football?  I enjoy football!  Do you enjoy football?
I enjoy sports. I like American football and the game, it's a funny looking ball, a funny look at a football.
Yes, American football.  I know the highest football score ever was 222 to 0.  Do you know what that is?
I have no idea, what was the highest score? I know it was three teams and it was a 222 to zero, I wonder what it was?
Georgia Tech and Cumberland. The score was 222-0.
That is a humiliating score.  Very spirited and unsportsmanlike.
I agree I don't know why they would score over 100 points in a game, I wonder if they did it to score a few points, in the 60s bowlers made twice as much as football players.
I guess I missed my window, I was born too late. I wish I could go back. I would like to be a bowler. I need the money, I guess I'm just not good enough in the soul and body for the money. I was Born too late, back in the 60's.
Me too, it's an easier sport on the body. Have you heard of Benjarvus Ellis-Green of the Patriots?
No I have not heard of him, is he famous or just a name?
He played for the Patriots and was a QB for them, and he never fumbled a ball in any time on the team and never fumbles any time he played
That is amazing!  He must have had enormous hands and probably had special gloves.
That is impressive!  ESPN created the line that shows first down for them.  I can't imagine watching a game without it!
I guess ESPN saw the obvious thing to do and did it. I wonder if it is any good. I thought it was the obvious things to do. I guess ESPN did the right thing, but I don't know why.
Yes, it was a great invention and they even won an Emmy for it!
I think the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than an NFL player. I wonder why that is. The average lifetimeEarnings of an NFL Player is a bit below the average for an engineer. I think I might like that award a little bit more, but I think it's all over the line.
I think it pays well but I would prefer to be an engineer. It's easier on the body and I don't know if risking injury constantly would be easier than a football career.
It would be easier on my body too, fewer concussions, and engineering. Maybe women could do better as well, women have been doing it since 1960's
Apparently the NFL has no written rules against female players. There have been no female players since the 1950's.
Yes. It would make for an interesting contest. I think it would make some of the fans a little uncomfortable but not too much.
It would be difficult, especially at one of the positions.  I wonder if we would ever get a female kicker.  There are players of every size at the kicker position.  Maybe there's a reason that there hasn't been a female for that positions.
Hey there! Are you a football fan?
I am, I like linebackers, I would like to see Khalil Mack play, but not Lawrence Taylor, he is too old.
I dont follow him personally, but I have heard great things about him.
I wonder if Bill Belichick and Lawrence Taylor are any good?  I wonder how he compares to Taylor?  Or Bill Belichick.
Taylor is very iconic, and Mack is also pretty talented, but Taylor is so iconic, he stands the test of time their opinions might change.
Taylor was a beast on the field. I remember when he broke joe tehismann's leg on Monday night football.
Wow.  I dont remember that.  That sounds awful!
Yeah, it was by accident.
there is no rule against female football players, but there is a rule that there wouldnt be a female QB that could hit with so much power. why arent female football player.
I agree with you. The average football players weigh about 180 lbs but the average woman would not be able to hold that kind of mass to protect herself.
I wonder if they are treating cheerleaders equitably.
Yeah, I heard that the Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player and have to leave if one comes in.  That's ridiculous.  I wonder why they have to do that?  Why can't they just leave if an NFL player comes in?  I've heard that other cheerleaders is forbidden from Eating in the the same Restaurant as well.
I wonder what happened to make that rule?
I'm not sure, seems kind of shady but who knows,
Bellichick is actually the winningest coach in post season football, with 21 wins.
Yeah, that is quite a playoff win, the Patriots first ever playoff win against the Browns and then the next playoff win was against the Patriots.
They have been historically bad teams since then lol, I think they had 3 since he took over there.
Yeah, and they're on par with the Patriots with 4 Super Bowl losses and 2 of the Bills 5 Super Bowl wins, so they're definitely not on par. What do you think about the Patriots?
I think the Patriots are going to win it this year and then the rest of time lol, I think they will win it every year for the rest.
I agree, they are the Lannisters of the NFL, I agree with the author of the Game of Thrones, the Lannister are the only Lannisters in the NFL.
Lol, nice chat!  Have a great day!
Do you enjoy football? I really do.
I love football, what about you?
i love going to the games, especially the patriots.
The Patriots are a winner and they won the Super Bowl. Tom Brady puts a lot of work into the game, so I'm glad they got to work.  I think that he deserves to be the winner because of his dedication to the Patriots.  Do you know why the Patriots won the super bowl?
I agree, I love the team. Tom's plan for a good life is joy, peak performance and avocado ice-cream. What a good way to have a goodLife.
Lol.  I'll have to read that book.  One more interest history tidbit.  The Cleveland Browns last playoff win was in 1997.  You are familiar with the Patriots and Belichick?  The Browns last head coach to win it was Belichick, of course.  He's the head coach of the Patriots.  Did you ever read that "A Different Book?"
Interesting, yeah the Browns have a devoted group of fans. They're like the avocado ice-cream, if you add enough sugar to the avocado you can add enough Sugar to the Patriots. That's what I was thinking, I'm not sure if it was avocado ice cream or the Patriots, but I'm going to have to look it up.
I like avocados, but I don't like avocado ice cream, do you?  Eventually the Patriots will do an ice cream role in Robert Kraft buying Sullivan Stadium and then eventually the Patriots are going to be the next Jackson's victory tour.  I'm sure there will be some ice cream.  What about you?
The New England Patriots and Buffalo Bills have the most super bowl loses with six. That's more than any other two teams.
I didn't know that.  I wonder if that has anything to do with the tracking chips the NFL has embedded in players shoulder pads and footballs.  It's possible they are using them to help improve the game with the chips theNFL has embedded into the players shoulder pad and football.
I think its a great idea.  I think they help with inflated footballs!  lol
I wonder if that's what they program the chips in to the shoulder pads or the footballs? I thought it was the shoulder padding lol, I never thought of that.
lol  That is funny.  The games of thrones author calls the new england patriots the lannisters of the NFL.  I wonder why?
hahaha I didn't know that.  I do know Snoop Dogg is into funny stuff.  He wrote a fight song for his sons high school football team.  It's a fight Song for their school football TEAM!
I do like him! I think he's good! It's interesting that in the NFL there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay. That's so little!
I think the song is very good. It was a highly recruited player for college. He is a highly recruits player forcollege. I think it is good because the game takes so much hours. In every game they stretch it out to a short amount of time. I like the song because it is just a song for that short amount.
It is crazy how long it lasts.
Do you know that 14 of the world's largest stadiums belong to American college football teams? And they seat 18,000.
I bet they do! Texas is a big football state!  I'm from Texas, how do you feel about pink locker rooms?  I bet it's not for everyone, lol.
I am not familiar with pink locker rooms. I know that they are bigger in Texas, but I'm not sure if I am familiar withPink locker rooms is for breast cancer awareness, lol! What do you think of it?
Yes they are. The University of Iowa painted the visitors locker room pink. Well it's been a good chat, I have to go.
I wonder what's going on in their minds?  I don't like that at all.  The visiting team should be the visiting team, not them.  lol  I enjoyed the chat.
lol  Have a good night!
Have a good night too!
Hey how are you, I guess Richard Sherman is a free agent and will be going to the Seahawks as a freeAgent.
I do like football. I remember them winning a Super Bowl once.
Not really into football. It's interesting that the AFC and the NFC used to split into two conferences, but the Patriots are in the AFC.
I like how the Seahawks almost beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl.  The play call on the first play from the 20 yard line was on the Patriots 6 yard line.
Yeah that's pretty crazy.  Did you know the NFL has no rule against female players?
I don't think so, there is a kicker who plays for a men's football team, I bet there are some bets that they will have a female kicker who play for the men's Football team.
Interesting, I wonder how often she is lining up for commercial. The average game only lasts 11 minutes with the refs making decisions. the rest is filled with the rest of the game, commercials and the ref's making decisions!
I didn't either, but it does interest me a bit because I like to follow the ball quite a bit more and I like the yellow line, espn got an emmy for the yellow Line.
Yep that was a smart invention, I like that too. I like the NFL to put tracking chips in their uniforms, to check the players speed and location in real time.
Yeah, interesting how football has progressed. It's not the case as top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars in the 1950s.
That is crazy. I wonder if a professional bowler ever got a shot at that haha. What is your favorite team? I mentioned the Patriots, I like the Patriots. Are they your favorite? Do you have a favorite team, or do you have one that you like to shot at?
They are a great team, BellBellichick is the only NFL coach with more postseason wins than them with 21 postseason wins.
Yep I agree with you! I also miss the days when the teams played at Gillette Stadium. I'd love to see them play at Gillete Stadium. Did you know they have a stadium named after them? I'd like to see it. I wonder if they play there with a razor LOL
Haha that is funny. I have seen some of those games before.
No, I don't watch it at all. Have you seen the show Game of Thrones? Or the actual Game of thrones?
No, I haven't but it's caught my attention. I usually watch football on the first Sunday in February because of the super bowl parties. Do you watch football?
The author of the Lannisters in game of thrones is pretty cool, the only reason I bring this up is because the Patriots are the Lannister's lol, they're the bad guys lol
That's pretty funny. I guess the Browns were good at one point, and their head coach was Bill Belichick. Their playoff win was their first playoff win since 1995. I think it was against the Patriots. The Patriots are not good, but I guess The Browns were Good.
Yeah he is a great coach and is the winningest coach in the NFL postseason, he is the most winningest in the history of the NFL, very impressive,
Yes it is!  The patriots let the gians score a touchdown at the end of Super Bowl 46 and they were trying to avoid scoring and let the Gians score, but I guess that was enough to increase their odds of winning as they were able to avoidscoring again.
Yeah that was a crazy game!  That was amazing,  also funny how the last time the Cleveland Browns won the superbowl was the last game of Bill coaching and it was the first time the Browns won,  Amazing!
Have you ever heard of Dez Bryant?
yeah, wde receiver. he is going to have a tough time with the rest of his job, he is getting a toughtime
Yeah, he was a first round draft pick in 2007.  He got cut in April from the Cowboys.  Ouch, that's gotta hurt!
I know right! He had like 50 catches for 622 touchdowns in the first 10 seasons with 20 or more catches in all 6 seasons. Impressive carreer thouhg.
Yeah, he sure did play the game for quite a while.
I heard that the Patriots can sign him. He can't be suspended or injured. I think the Patriots have a tough time sigining a wide receiver. I wonder who Edelmans replacement will be. I don't think the Pats can sign someone who is not suspended or injure.
I thought you might like him too. Bryant turned down a $1 year offer from Baltimore in the spring, I wonder if he regrets that now?
I bet he does regret it, I mean Baltimore did get him a 3 year offer afterall sometimes greediness makes you the wrong call, I would say the pay is decent, but I think he is alright with the team, I bet he will regret it later, after all sometimes greed makes you do the wrong decision, he is still with the Ravens, the pay and the pay of the team is decent and the offer is a 3 years offer after all
I heard that the Patriots have kicked the tires on Bryant.  Have the Browns, or the Patriots?  Have they kicked the tire on Bryant?
Do you watch football? I'm not a fan, but I know what team I like. Are you a fan?
haha I like to watch football and I like the Super Bowl party in order to pig out on the food. I have never been to one before though. Have you?
Lol, the superbowl food is great!  I watch college football and the University of Iowa has the visitors lockers painted completely different than the ones used in the sport.  I wonder how they do it?  Superbowl food is Great!
Hmm, that's interesting. I guess football doesn't really catch my attention because I only like the first 11 minutes of live gameplay.
My favorite team is probably the Patriots, but the NFL has a lot of other team's too, do you have a favorite team? I always thought it was called the "Lannisters of the NFL," thats a funny reference, do You like the Patriots?
Interesting! Bill Belichick has the most wins of any of the coaches in NFL postseason football with 21 wins.
Yeah, Bill Belichick is a great coach, and apparenty he is one of the main reasons for the team's success this season, the Browns.  He has been one of several main Reasons for the Browns success this year.
Yeah he is, the Browns' last playoff win was in 1995, I think that was the Browns last of their playoff wins, right?
Yeah, and the Pats had the most Superbowls but only had 3 losses.  I didnt know that the team with the most wins and most losses was the team without a Superbowl, the Pats.
Hmm, that's interesting.  I've never watched a game at the Gilette Stadium where the patriots play, have you?  Where does the Patriots play?
I havent, tickets are so expensive and the histoy of NFL is so amazing, it is amazing that a team has incredible stats and is so successful there, I prefer to just watch the game from home, tickets can get expensive but the team has great stats so I would say its the histOY of NFL,
Yeah, they have been a great team for a while.
Hi buddy, are you a Patriots fan?
I love the Patriots!  You?
I hold a fondness for the bills. I rarely show up to a football game. I was one of the Cleveland conscientious objectors.
Pro football was in the NFL until the NFL and the AFL were both merged in 2000.
Yeah, I think that would have been better.  The Patriots and the Bills are actually considered equal in the number of Superbowl losses, with the Bills having a number of superbowl losses that are considered equal to the Patriots.
I know, right? Do you know how Bill Belichick does it?
Man, the man was the coach of Cleveland the last time the Browns won a playoff game. He was the only coach to beat the Patriots. The last time he beat the patriots was in 1995. That was belicheck.
That is an interesting factoid, my friend, very interesting!  I heard some writer guy called the New England Patriots the Lannisters of the NFL, I wonder why?
Nice! I wonder if the movie will ever cast Peter Dinklage as Bill Belichick? The movie would have to be nice!
He wins in the end, that's for sure.  The NFL does not rule that women can play in the NFL and if they pass eligibility requirements, they can.  I wonder if it will ever come to that?
Yeah, my wife would definitely qualify for that, but I don't know if I would want to be her wife.  The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of playing time so she'd be 15 minutes late if she were a few minutes late.
I didn't know that, did you know that the average lifetime earning of an engineer being higher than that of an NFL player is because of the average Lifetime earning of a engineer beinghigher than that?
Well, that would encourage me!  Did you know that New Orleans cheerleader are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the football players.  I wonder why?
Hmmm, I can recall that being a thing, I wonder why that is?  If she can eat in the same place, why not?  And where would she eat?
I guess we can always fall back on plan, or at least install those NFL tracking chips on the wifes clothing so they can monitor the velocity and the rotation and maybe even install those NFC tracking chips in your wifES clothing to help you fall back to plan.
Thats a great plan! Sounds like something I would do!
I hope to superimpose those virtual yellow lines in front of department stores soon.  My wife yardage is so far behind I could probably get an Emmy like ESPN did.
That's an excellent plan! Football codes can be traced back to the codification of the games at English public schools in the nineteenth century.
I wonder if they gave up codification, or just obsessed with it.  I would be obsessed if it was 222-0.  Then I would walk around muttering about my new year's resolution.  222-1 is not going to go over.
That's not a sound resolution at all.  Do you like the Patriots superbowl win?
I bet it was.  If Benjarvus Ellis-Green had played in the game, he never fumbled in his entire career.  He has never f fumble once in his whole entire career!  Nice chatting!
Do you watch NFL?  Do you like it?
Yea, it's crazy the Seahawks released Richard Sherman
Yeah, did you know women can play too?
I heard that, although the NFL has no official rule barring female players.  They have no official Rule barring female player
Yeah, I hear there is no rule against it. Did you hear of the rleans cheerleaders?
Yea, Saint's cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurants as men and are not even allowed to be in thesame restaurants asmen, pretty unfair
That is so unfair. I think worst is that they have to leave mid meal if they are not doing well.
Yea, the saints has a rule forcing their cheerleaders to leave if a player stops by, or the rule forcing them to leave when a player comes in.
I have no idea but pretty sexist if you ask me.
Yea, they should change that rule!
I really hope so too. Did you know players have been using tracking chips in them since 2010?
That's pretty cool. They must know how hard a player hits and moves and they find that using the chips.
I know.  That is handy.  I wonder what the highest score in U of IA football history was?
The game Georgia tech scored 222 to 0. That was a game Georgia Tech scored 222 points
Yeah, I wonder who they were trying to win there. and ESPN won an emmy too.
Yea I heard about that.  Did you know the team the Browns beat in the playoffs was the New England Patriots, a team the browns beat in 2016?
I did not know that.  I do know that Buffalo Bills are equal to Patriots in losses though.
That makes sense. The Patriots are on top right now so that makes sense! The Bills lost 5 super bowls in a row but that's off the top of my head because I don't know how many bills lost in a Row to the Patriots.
Yeah. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
Yes, the running back for the Patriots. Apparently he has never fumbled a football in his whole career and that's crazy!
Yeah, what a talent. Nice chat.
Hi, do you like football?
I love it! I wish it was in color like the U of Iowa visitor locker Room.
Pink, I think right. What's the name?
I wonder that too. Did you know in the 60s bowlers made more than football players?
That seems fair, it was a more popular sport back in the day so I think that is fair.
Yeah true. Do you know the highest score in college football game ever?
Yes that was 222-0 and they were playing against each other in a game
Wasn't it Georgia Tech that beat Cumberland?
Yeah and that holds the record for the highest score ever, 4,099 to 0
Yeah. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for it?
Yes for the superimposed yellow line
Yes that made game watching much easier to be honest
Yeah. Did you know women can play in the NFL?
Yes there is no rule against them playing if they qualify
yeah I hope they get on the field at some point
Yeah. Did you know that the gameplay only last for 11 minutes?
I would be glued to the TV for hours on end if I were him!
Yes we are, ironic engineers apparently make more over their lifetime than most football players do.
I think that is because they have longer careers and so do they, so they must have longer lives.
True.  They use chips in the players now to track stuff.
Yeah pretty high tech for sure, nice chat today.
Hello.  Are you a fan of the NFL?
I watch occasionally, especially for the big games like super bowl. How about you?
I didn't watch the Super Bowl this year, the Patriots won, did you?
Yes, the Pats did.  Coach Belichick is the winningest coach in NFL postseason football with 21 wins.  He is the most winningest Coach in NFL.
Yeah, and he is also the coach of the last time the Browns have won.
Wow.  The Pats and Buffalo bills are tied for the most losing super bowls though.  They have been in all the Super Bowls but none since the 90's.
I think it's funny that George RR Martin calls the Patriots the lannisters of the NFL.
 Pat BENJAMUS GREEN-ELLIS never fumbled a football in his nfl career
Haha, no I didn't know that! That's an incredibly cool achievement though. I guess it's funny that even women can technically play football, so women can theoretically play football too
I did not but that is pretty cool. I wonder how many team actually picks them up as long as they meet eligibility requirements and if they meet that, if a team actually selects them, then they can actually play.
Well, it is a pretty sexist industry. I understand why not a lot of women want to play.
That's true. I bet you can believe that. I can't believe that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
Women can also make more money as well, engineers, they make more than men.
Yes, they will.  Just like the top bowlers who made more than the top football stars in the 1960s.
Haha, time travelers, women are the best time travelers! It sucks that a Saints player walks in and has to leave a restaurant if a female cheerleader comes in, because women can't leave if they are a Saints cheerleader. I wonder why they have to leave if a player comes in.
Yea, if you are in a restaurant and an NFL player comes in, you have to leave.  I wonder if the NFL team would have to ask them to leave if a player came in.
I don't know, but it would seem sexist and even worse, I'm sure it's worse than it is now
Yeah, I wonder what happened to that weird rule. It's a really weird rule!
I can't imagine anything happening that warranted forcing the women to leave.  I mean the cheerleaders are having fun and it's fun to just sit down and chat.  It's like they literally have to leave mid-meal if the male players come in, or sit down.  What's going on?  I can't see anything happening to the women that warrantedforcing the women out.  Why would the male player have to sit there, but the women have to stay?  Why can't the male Players just sit there and chat with the cheerleader?
LOL  That's very rude.  I wonder if they ever do that to visiting football teams.  The Univ of Iowa has a pink locker room for the visiting football team.
Yeah, I guess it is a very powerful color, I wonder if it is good or not haha. pink is a really powerful color though!
I am a big football fan. Are you?
I'm not a huge fan, but I follow my team closely. What about you?
I used to be when I was younger.  I lived in Louisiana so the Saints were my team when I lived there.  Funny they brought in a new team and it's funny they brought them in in 1999.
I follow the packers, I am from Wisconsin.  They didn't make the playoffs this year, so that was disappointing.
I bet there are a few Packers fans who are still dedicated to their football team and are dedicated to getting the Super Dome in Louisiana used for football games.  Have you gone to any NFL or college games?  I've been to a few college games. I think there's a Super Dome there.  I think I passed out when I was in the dome.
I have been to a few games but the Super Dome in Louisiana is where I got older and I went back when I was older, so I have never been to the games there.
I have been to a bunch of them. It's so fun. The super dome is really crazy, so many people there. Tom Brady, and a bunch others.
Yeah, I would think so, he is one of the best.  He was picked 199th in the NFL draft and has won the most games, he has won so many since being picked way back in 2005.
That is impressive and I'm not surprised, his history as a football player is impressive. He retired from the Patriots after the Super Bowl. The Patriots have been to the Super bowl 13 times in their history!
yeah he is, he is 34 and still has a few more seasons, he should retire after a few seasons, right?
Wow, I kind of want him to hang it up for a while longer but if he doesn't, I don't blame him, like Peyton Manning stayed for even longer.
Yeah. I liked him. He's a really good quarterback too. I always thought he was pretty funny.
He was funny.  I'm reading these articles and it's scary to think that Tom Brady has never eaten a strawberry before lol.  How is that possible?  Like who would have eaten a Strawberry before lol
That is insane, he can eat a strawberry?
Yeah, I know there are a lot of weird things about food.  In articles like these I leave out the crazy factual factual section like how he was in a restaurant.  I'll leave that one out.  Did you know that the New Orleans Saints have had an NFL player in every restaurant since 1960?  They have had a lot.  It was a New Orleans player.  Weird things aboutfood!
That is crazy. I think that rule is really outdated and silly. I can't imagine a cheerleader having to leave. I mean, they have to leave? Can you imagine a quarterback leaving?
I know, sad.  If I were a cheerleader, I would leave if I didn't finish my meal.  There are double standards.  I can see that.  They can't just leave when they don't like it.
Yeah, that type of thing is not normal anymore.  Double standards.  It's not normal at all.  That type ofthing needs to go away.  I think we are over the double standards.
I think that will probably change for the better soon. I heard that cheerleaders don't make as much money as they used to.  They put a lot of work into keeping their bodies pretty much perfect.  It's a shame that that has to change, but with all the money that they make, they should put a LOT of work Into keeping their body pretty much Perfect.
Yeah that is a shame but I think the players make more than them, so they can do what they like,
Well I hope the rest of you have a good one! It's been nice talking with you, I hope you have the rest in your day!
Thanks, I hope you have a good night.
Hello, do you follow football?
I occasionally do during the big games like Super Bowl, but not often. Do you?
I like football, I watch it sometimes, Tom Brady is an excellent quarterback.
I agree with you there.  He will soon retire though, he was born in August of 1977 and will retire in 32.
Hmmm that is a good question.  I'm sure he's due some time,  I think it's just life.  LOL  He's probably just going to have fun the rest of his life. He's considered the best quarterback in the NFL,  so he could probably retire any time now.  He could be considered the GOAT and be due some some time soon.
Smart, he was one of the best players in NFL history.  He won 6 Super Bowls and I guess he was the only QB to have won more than two Super Bowl's.  I guess that's why he is one of only 2 players in nfl history.
Well, it's been awhile since I've seen him. I bet he still has some moves in him, but he's getting up there in age. Most football players retire by this time of the year, but I bet some of them don't last.
True. He's the best player in history, and it's easy to forget with all the Super Bowls and all the Pats fans and all, but he's still the best.
Wow, he really is a patriot.  Benjarvus Green Ellis, a Pat's player, has never fumbled a football in his entire NFL career.  I wonder if he is also a Patriot?  He has never once fumbled in his whole NFL career, and he is the only Pat player to have done so.
Yeah that's amazing!  Hey, did you realize that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live game play?  I didn't realize that.  I think the average nfl game only lasts about 11 minutes.
That's kinda crazy.  That is a long time for a game.  It must stop a lot.  I know that if I were an engineer, I'd work for a long, long time, because it makes so much money!  A engineer makes more money in a lifetime than an NFL player and has fewer than 20 years of work in a game!
Yeah and engineering requires a lot of knowledge and schooling, so it's not surprising that it's in the top 10, but yeah and engineering also requires a LOT of knowledge. Back in the 1960s bowlers made more than football players, which is surprising because they were the top bowlers back then.
Wow, that is nuts!  I wonder what the big star was?  lol  Did you know the NFL has no written rules against females as long as the requirements are met.  And the NFL does not have any written rulesAgainst females as LONG as they are a big star.
It's too bad they don't have a pink locker room like the Univ of Iowa does for visiting football teams.  They have a white and pink lockerroom for the visiting football team.
haha ya that would be different, did you know there was a crazy high score game that ended with 222-0 that's unbelievable
Yeah that would have been awful! If I was on the losing team I bet I would have benefited from it and probably benefited from not seeing it. I wonder today if the tracking chips in the players' shoulder pads and the tracking tracking chips on their shoulder pads help them record their moves? I figured they would use them to record everything and yeah, that would be awful! Could be wrong though...
That is a really good point, I think they should do that when they retire hahaa. It's not a lot of money but it's a lot more than the amount of money that Tom Brady's wife makes after they retire though, she makes twice the amount that he makes and she has twice theamount of money he does.
LOL, yeah, they have the body and talents so alas they play football or work regular ole jobs.
Hahaha, wow that is a lot of money.
Victoria Secret?  She's a Brazilian model who is the highest paid in the world.  It's pretty cool she is the second highest paid.  I think she and Brady make the best team in the whole world. They deserve it they work hard.
She is the highest paid model and the husband of the highest paying model, that is great! Tom Brady will stay on the team for a while and I'm sure his marriage with her is great. I wonder if Tom Brady and his husband will be the last two players in the NFL, I think they are the best players and I think Brady will be one of the best for many, many years. Thanks for chatting with me this evening, I have to get going, maybe Tom Brady can take me to the NFL.
hi, do you like football?
I love the sport, do you have a favorite team, AFC or NFC?
AFC.  I like the Bears.  You?
I like the New England Patriots and the AFC, you?
Nice...  they had a great run in 2018.  I think they'll win it again.  What do you celebrate when they win?
No.  No idea.  Bill Belichick got served.  That's the thing about them.  He does his thing.
I thought Bill had a great game plan.  He limited the offensive genius to just 20 points and he limited the defensive genius to 2 points.
Yeah the game was a bit boring to me, I thought there was too much action and not enough action.
I know it is boring but Bill usually wins the boring but bill usually wins in the boring.  Did you know there is only 11 minutes of play in a game?
I guess, but 11 minutes is not an exiting form for sure. If it were boring I think he would win, but if I have to lose for 11 minutes, then I guess I would want to win.
Yeah, I'm not sure.  I'm a Bears fan, and those guys had a few wins in the last decade or so.  Not sure what that means for the next decade or two.
Yeah, Brady is a good luck charm and we are pretty lucky to have him!
He is such a good looking dude. dreamy.
Yes!  And he has a smoking hot wife and a great athlete, he might give it his all and give it the whole life.
He is so good at everything he does. I kind of hate those guys though. He's never eaten strawberries. I've never eaten them. What do you think about that?
I kind of do, lol, they are weird, for the most part. I have never tried strawberries though, have you? I am not one for strawberries, that is just weird.
I had a strawberry protein shake this morning that was made with real strawberries. I had a few back in my youth, but I'm sure I am missing out on them now. I wonder if it was actually made with Real strawberries, or was it a strawberry Protein Shake this morning.
Strawberries are so tasty, I would never live without them. He has a good td pass record. He had a good TD pass record in 2007.
Yeah, he does.  Do you remember that Randy Moss season?  Magical.  He had 50 tds in that season.
Yeah magical indeed. Prior to that he only threw 40 passes in one season so yeah that was something.
I think I'll go look him up now.  It has been nice chatting, have a great day!
Hello, do you like football?
I know a little bit. It's crazy to think that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
Yes, and yet they have microchips in the shoulder pads and balls.
I didnt know that either, I wonder why they need microchips in those areas.
They track the movement of players and statistics about the ball like velocity, etc.
Its interesting how technology has advanced, they have to be pretty strong in order to handle the damage they do.
Yeah,  I would have thought that players earned alot more money before then.
I know an engineer will earn more money, but an engineer is the MVP, not an NFL player.  I think the soccer players are paid more, but the NFL player is the best.
That's crazy.  In one game in 1916 one team scored over 300 points and the other team scored only 3 points.
I know right.  That team is really skilled for sure.
I agree, it was Georgia Tech.  I think the other team scored 132 to 0, but I'm not sure.
It was the worst defeat in football history. Tom Brady is the best QB ever, so he must have been able to do something about it.
Personally I don't like him but I respect his talent for winning so many superbowls.
He is very talented, he threw 50 touchdown passes to himself once and threw 50 to a team once.  Are you a fan of his?
I'm a San Francisco fan, they have won the most Superbowl appearance and I think they have the most superbowl appearance, so I like them.
Yes, it was their last Superbowl appearance.
I don't remember, but I don't pay that much attention to sports so I don's remember.
I am a Patriots fan.  Did you know that benjarvus green-ellis never fumbled in his entire NFL career.
That is quite a record.
Yes, and it is the sole holder of that record, he is the only one.
In the 60s bowlers made twice as much as football stars.
That's crazy! I can't imagine bowlers earning that much, but I can see how the lowest paid football player might be the lowest pay.
What do you think of Tom Brady? I think he's getting ready to retire.
I think the consensus among many experts is that he is still playing.
His wife makes a ton of money. She makes more than twice as much as he does. She also makes a lot more than him.
Yeah, it is because she has been spending a lot of time doing some charity work.  Football is not her main priority and she is spending a whole lot of her time on charity work
And continues to do it.  I wonder if he will retire soon.  He is a buddy Gronk.  Do you think he will ever retire?
I heard that.  I don't think he's going to, though.
He has a supermodel wife and two kids. He has a chance to get permanently hurt if he ever gets permanently hurt.
He has a family and was talking about wanting to get a family.
I think he's going to be a guru for them. Guerrero was kicked off the Patriots' campus and was training at the QB guru's training facility.
I wonder if that caused some tensions on the team.
The Pats made a mistake trading away Jimmy Garoppolo.
I agree. I think they did.
I don't think it's going to hurt him, but I think he's going down.
Did you know that the NFL has no written rule against female players and that women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements?  The NFL has said that they do not have a written ruleAgainst female players.
I did not know that. Women have played in college for many of the non-contact positions.
I think they should try in the NFL.
I don't know, I'm not big into it.
Yeah, I wonder what would happen now.
I think I saw my son's modified grade school had a girl playing the offensive line in their game, she was fearless, but respected.  She played like the smallest lineman, but was fearless.  I think that's great, she had to be, she is the smallest and the smallest offensive line.
that is awesome, her son's team is really good, I wonder if they were good on the other side as well.
Yes, it was great talking to you, have a great day!
Are you a Rams fan?  I'm not.  The Rams and Saints winning was a little concerning.  Rams won but showed some of their skills and also showed some new skills.
I am not a Rams fan. I switch cities too often. I have too much taste for my taste.
Yes.  Michael Thomas got a 40 yard touchdown pass to himself with only 11 minutes to play.  The saints made it look so much better with that!
That is pretty amazing.  The game pitted a young couch to a 55 year old coach.  Pretty crazy the age differential between the two, the old versus the new.  It's pretty crazy.
I hope to see females in the league someday.  There is no rule against it and females can actually meet the league eligibility.  They need some fresh ideas.
I think female football players are fairly common in high school, but it's not something that is common in the US.
Yes, they are.  There are some alarming rules that the NFL make.  New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player and have to leave if a player comes in before they are done.  If they are already in the diner and an NFL player comes into the restaurant, they must leave.
That's a fairly standard rule with NFL teams. The Washington Redskins cheerleaders are not allowed to fraternize with any players at all.
Did you know that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay on average for a game?  I can't watch an NFL game, but I can watch an NBA game.
That is so accurate. I watch football every weekend and to be honest I am not surprised that is only 11 minutes of it. I know I watch it every weekend but I am surprised it is only that accurate.
I wonder what a job that makes you over a lifetime would be like.  I'd rather be an engineer, than an average NFL player or MLB player or an engineer.  An average NFL Player has a job
I know engineers make a lot of money, but I am surprised that they make more than a bunch of players, engineers make more in a year, I think they make a whole lot ofmoney
I wonder if they made more than the top football stars, or a bowler, who made twice as much as the top Football stars in the 1960s
I wonder how popular they were, I know it was not very popular
In 1916, georgia tech beat cumberland 222-0!  I wonder if they were shamed by the team that was shamed for such an upset football game.
I don't know.  Tom Brady was listed on the injury report every week for the 2007 and 2008 seasons.  I wonder why he was?
That's strange, Tom Brady has never thrown 30 touchdown passes in a season and he threw 50 this year, he's thrown 50 this season and has already thrown 50 touchdown passes so I wonder if it was because of that?
I was surprised he was a great quarterback, he is, he's also a great QB but I'm surprised he's never eaten a strawberry in his life
He must be worried about allergies?  I know that a lot of people are allergic to them.  His wife actually makes quite a bit of money too.  She's more than double his salary.  I wonder what her salary is.
I would have thought that was more, to be honest.
The person writing article section said that the underdog always seems to win, so the underdog will always win.  Have a good day!
Hello!  Do you watxh football?
I do, I watch Tom Brady's record-settting superbowl performance.
Yes and it was funny.  I think there are only 11 minutes of gameplay in it.
Yeah I think the NFL uses tracking chips in equipment and balls to monitor what is being done on the field for the 11 minutes per game. It's very predictable.
I wonder what they do with the info they collect.
They tracck player location, ball speed, field, ball size. In New Orleans, the cheerleaders are not allowed to dine on the field.
Yeah, and the worst part is that players have to leave mid meal if they come in and players are already there.
I know right, I wonder why they can't eat there, did you know the NFL has no written rule against female players, they can play if they want to?
That would make sense.  I wonder what they would do.  Do you know?
I know right!  I would brush up against the cheerleader and get a brush up on my table Iif a player beats me on the field or the cheerleaders.  I do not like to see cheerleaders on the nfl field.  They are sad lol but Tom Brady's wife is a model so he gets to go to the NFL twice a week!  That is sad lol
Engineers make more money than some players, but engineers make more than many players too.
Yes, and engineers make more than Brady makes, his wife makes more than him too!
That does make sense, engineers contribute something great to the world so they should get more, but it doesn't make sense to me.
It's above my pay grade, but it takes a genius to figure that out.  What I don't like about Bill Belichick is that he lists Brady in the injury report every week, even though he's not injured or under discussion, and lists Brady on the injuryReport every week!  I wonder how he does it?  Is he really really injured, or is it just in the "above my paygrade" discussion?
hahaha true!  I don't think Brady has ever eaten a straberry!
No, I did not know that! I wonder if he could handle a strawberry? I mean, despite being married to one of the hottest ladies in the world, he is largely considered one of our greatest QBs and by his profession, largely because he is married to the hottest women in the country. He has made it to the top of the heap in his time in the game and made it as far as the chillies heel.
Hahhaa.  That's it.  He can't do anything right.
The university of Iowa painted the U of Iowa's team "Buffalo Strawberry-colored" because visitors to the U.S. had not come in yet. Maybe the Bills changed their team's name to Pink to gain advantage?  Did the Bills paint the visitors' locker room pink?  Why not Buffalo Strawberry- colored?
Hahaha. Do you know what the highest score in football ever was?
Yeah, that would be Georgia tech crushing of Cumberland, 222-0! ouch!
I wonder how they felt after that?
I wonder how those bowlers made in that era to paid football palayers felt when they learned that they made half of what they did. ouch!
Hi! Do you like football?
I do enjoy the game.  I like the NFL, especially the first 11 minutes alive gameplay of its 18 minutes.
That is very short.  There is no rule against females playing, but I don't know why there is a rule against males playing.
As long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements, then they can. I would like to see a girl play.
I wonder if Saints cheerleaders get to eat at the same place as the players?  They can't eat in the same spot as players.
What a weird rule. I wonder how they enforce the rules with the cheerleaders being required to leave.
I'm not sure, but I don't know why they would have to if they asked politely.  I would be upset if I was a cheerleader and I was asked to leave a restaurant.  It's very demeaning to a cheerleading.  If they lose their inhibitions and are asked to hook up with a player in a restaurant, they lose all their inhibisons.
That is a really good point! I wonder how the NFL tracks cheerleaders, I know the NFLtracks players movements on the field, but how does that even help?
I hope not. It seems kinda stalker-ish and also disturbing.
They also track the balls to measure velocity, rotation, ball speed, rotation. They can also track it with location.
That makes sense, I think it can be helpful in assessing the QBs.
Do you know Tom Brady's football stats? He's been in 6 Super Bowls.
He is an all time great, pretty good. Do you have a favorite team? I don't, but he's a great QB. I like the 49ers, he's an all all time Great.
I do, I like the patriots lol, I think Tom Brady is the best, I just think that I keep missing out on Tom Brady because I haven't eaten a strawberry in my entire life, what is missing from your life?
I am a Bears fan so I don't mind the Pats, but not sure why I'm so against them.
Chicago has a dedicated fan base. Soldier Field is a fun place to watch a game. Tom Brady and the Patriots, but I'm not sure if I'd watch a season with out him.
He is like Randy Moss and blew them out of the water!
yup real talk.  Tom Brady's wives makes double her husbands salary
He must be really happy that he can make more than she does, I wonder what he would make if his wife made double his. That would be great!
I find it funny Brady was drafted in the first round in the 6th round in 2000. He has been around since the day.
I know.  Talent evaluators missed out!  Nice chatting with you!
I heard that Rob Gronkowski is actually leaving the Patriots.
Wow! Gronk is not a happy guy. He seems carefree and not too carefree.
He is a great player. He had a rough few seasons due to his health but he is a good player.
True. He's played in over 2,100 games so that is a long time.
Yeah, but Belichick will make the best decision for the coach, and he is the coach.
Yeah, I admit that Belichick has done a lot of admirable things about Gronkowski, but Robert Kraft of the Patriots isn't a huge fan. He says a lot about Gronk that he can't admit that Bill is a huge believer in, but I can see why Robert Kraft would be.
Yeah, Belichick has been called the "greatest coach in the history of coaching". That's a pretty big compliment, and he called himself the greatest coach, so it must mean something to him.
Geez, I guess he was hurt by the team.  Tom Brady is one of only two NFL players to win 3 super bowls.  I guess they don't have any other NFL players with more than 3 super bowl wins.
Wow. I didn't realize that. He's also married to Gisele Bundchen.
Yes he is. He's honestly one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time and I honestly think he should have been picked later in the draft. He ended-up being one of them because they lost faith in him and picked him later in a draft. Great story.
He did, he is the first player in history to be taken in the draft and then go on to be the best player in History, the Patriots are really lucky to have gotten him, they have 3Super Bowl appearances, that is unbelievable!
I think Brady won the Super Bowl in his first year as a starter. I think it was the year he became QB, but I'm not sure.
Yes, Kurt Warner was once a quarterback too.
Yes, it was. Did you know that Tom Brady's super bowls were decided by 3 points? That's crazy, it's like how many points were used for Tom Brady Super Bowls?
Wow, those are close games! He has played college football for the University of Michigan, but never won any championships. I wonder if he ever won any Championships while he played for the university of Michigan.
No, I don't know if he did, but I do know that he was on the bench when Michigan won the Rose Bowl and Championship. A lot of people think that he's the biggest steal in the NFL history and that he got taken off the bench and put on the Bench when Michiganwon the Rose bowl and championship.
I guess he was, he and Gronk have made some pretty big impact for the Patriots.
Yeah, they sure have.  But they also have Richard Seymour, Randy Moss and Chandler Jones. They were all shown the door.  Brady is probably safe from that law, though.
Yeah, agreed. The patriots have been one of the greatest teams in the NFL because Belichick held on for so long. The NFL has a long way to go and the players will be gone soon, but yeah, the Patriots are one of their greatest teams.
Yep. The guy makes a lot of tough moves. After losing last year he is sentimental and wants a shot at the roster. The last few years have been a little better, but the guy makes his own moves.
Absolutely, Belichick is excellent at putting together an award-winning roster, so no matter how much he changes it will always matter. The Patriots have been around since 1960 and they have a great roster, but Belichick is the best, and he knows how to put together an Award-winning lineup.
That is true.  I guess Belichick has all the football knowledge and expertise in the place.
I'm looking forward to that!
Hi, do you like football?
I do like American football. Do you?
Yes, people sometimes seem to forget how football used to be.  I mean soccer is also known as football.
Soccer is the popular sport in most of the world.  Football is gaining popularity in other countries as well and football is gaining in the US
I think internationally soccer is the most popular but I think football generally is too.
Americans love the gladiatorial contest of football.
Do you like american football?
I do. I watch the super bowl. Do you?
I did not like the performance of the Superbowl, a bit dissappointing after the performance in the SB.
It was a slow game, I heard it was a really slow game this year. I didn't watch it, did you watch it at all?
Do you think the Patriots are the lannisters of football?
That's funny.  I like the underdog, I root for the underdog.  The Lannisters is a long shot.  They are evil incarnate!  Evil incarnate...
I think the team with the talented players like Tom Brady, arrogance and reputation, with talented players, it is hard to dispute the results of the team and its hard to disputes the results when they have players like that.
I've heard accusations for cheating by the coaching staff, too.  I can't see how that is possible with that much talent.
I am not familiar with the details, I think the team that was accused of that is a known team, are you familiar with their details?
I figure if they get caught cheating they would have to pay a fine, but I don't know how much it would cost them but it seems like the cost would be pretty high.
I think so. I wonder if the cheating accusations were validated or not.
Makes sense though.  If a team wins a lot, people will accuse them of cheating.  I guess if a team doesn't win, people think they are cheating.
Do you have a favorite team?
I try to follow a team around this time of the season, playoffs are here and the energy is high, so I like to follow them. Great chat!  See you in the playoffs!
I don't have time either. I wish I had more time.
Are you a fan of Tom Brady?
No, I don't watch football but I heard he's getting old, they are phasing that part of his life out. It will be interesting to see.
He is one of the greatest of all time!
I have heard that too.  I think a lot of other people believe it too. I think he's going to stay on top forever.  The Patriots owe him a lot, though.  Sounds like the Patriots owe it to him to stay.
Yes. He has his critics, too. Did you see him play this season?
I think he has had some problems with his trainer and the team. It sounds like it has taken a toll on the rest of the team too.
Yeah, I think so. Do you think he will play next season?
I never realized he was married to Gisele Bundchen, I wonder why he never really realized it.
Yea, they recently went on a charity trip to Qatar together with a couple of children.  That was a charity Trip to Qatar.
Apparently she makes more than twice his salary, do you know what his salary is?
Yeah, she makes quite a bit more because of endorsments, but he still makes quite quite a lot as well
I don't know, he does a lot of football. I think it's pretty interesting the highest scoring game ever was 222 to 0. It was pretty interesting.
Yeah, Cumberland is a real small school, they must have been embarrassed because they never had anyone in history.
I bet they did. 222-0? That is shameful!
ESPN has really done well with their coverage of NFL games.  They won an emmy for their coverage in 2013.
I think I read about that!  I also know that they created the yellow line that is superimposed across the field.
I think they won an Oscar for that lol. I wonder if the field goal kicking line was the first one to win an Oscar? It was for the fieldgoal kicking line.
The technology in sports today amazes me. I knew the NFL tracks players on the field with chips but I never knew the nfl tracks players off the field!
I did not know that either!  I wonder how they use that data to improve safety of the game?
Oh, that makes sense.  It uses footballs to track the specific motions of the footballs.
I will be happy to see them in a couple of week for the super bowl and the next couple of year.
Are you a big fan of the Patriots generally?
I think the Patriots cheat a lot. Did you see the Belichick trade of the players he had, and the players who were in the Belichick Trade?
I agree they do cheat a lot, I don't think Belichick would trade them, I would trust him with his team, I do not think he would care about the team, but I agree that they do cheating, but who knows.
Maybe he'll let Rob Gronkowski win end up with the Pats.  He might stay on the Pats for a while.
He wants to be successful in a team atmosphere.
He is very effective for the Pats, so the change might make him more effective with the money. I am not sure how well that works out for him though, but who knows.
I agree. I'm not familiar with the Pats, but I think he cares a lot about atmosphere and attitude. I think that is appreciated and he's very successful because he cares about being successful. Players often leave for various reasons or stay with the same team because they want to be successful. He cares a a lotabout atmosphere and I think money-wise that is something that he can get.
I think he might trade some money for job satisfaction, but he probably will have the chance to get a bonus based on performance to reduce risk for the team.  He could also trade some time off to a team that gives him a bonus Based on performance.
Interesting. I suppose they have to get money for their money or they have NFL greed. I am not a big fan of the NFL.
They're paid pretty well considering there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.
True, but football (or soccer, or soccer, for that is the rest of the world) can run for hours and hours!
Yes I heard they are using tracking chips in the players' shoulder pads and the ball.  I wonder if it's the same ones in the ball or the tracking chips that are in the Players' shoulder pad?
That's like sci-fi. A chip in the shoulder? I wonder what that means, and where is it going, do we know?
You can put a chip in the players shoes, the pads of the players feet, the soccer balls, and the pads on the soccerballs
That makes the most sense, I think. Do you watch the super bowl every year in February? I watch the Super bowl everyyear in February
I watch it sometimes. I'm hoping they will add women to the game soon, that would make it more interesting for me and I was hoping they would add women.
Yes, it would be interesting. I wonder how they will handle women. I know theres a female coach but I'm not sure how they are going to handle the Kaepernick situation.
There are no women in coaching positions, so maybe we'll get one or two on the sidelines. Maybe in the announcers' booth, but I don't think we'll see women in coaches.
Things are improving, and it has normalized.  I'm glad to see that engineers are earning more than football players, now.  It seems to be more normalized.
Yes, it's hard to believe that engineers can make more than grown men playing with the ball.  It's hard for me to believe engineers have more than the grown men.
I agree. Our society values sports and celebrities more than us.
Great chat! Thanks!  You too!
Do you watch the NFL?
Yes I do. Did you know Snoop Dogg once wrote a song for his school team?
Nice. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
Hmm I wonder what the impact that is supposed to be supposed to have on them
I wonder too. Did you know bowlers made more money than NFL players in the 60s?
I did not know that, but I guess it makes sense since football was more popular back then.
Yeah true. Do you know what the highest score in college football was?
Yes that was in 1916 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0
Yeah I bet that is one way to brag.
Yeah, you know that high school football stadium in Texas that can fit 18,000 people? I can't even see how someone could fit into that.
Wow, I wonder how much that cost for the high school? I wonder if it is still around?
Yeah it cost a whooping $60 million, that's really expensive
Yeah I know. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
Yeah the man is a legend, he never fumbled the ball once, never once
Yeah, did you know women can play in the NFL too?  Did you know that?
Yeah there is no written rule against them, they just have to play with the best quality.
Yeah I hope so, did you know that the game only lasts 11 minutes, but the field is only used for about 11 minutes of it?
Yeah, I know. I would be glued to my TV for hours waiting for it to end.
We are strange, that's for sure.  Did you know engineers make more money than NFL players over the lifetime?  Engineers make more Money than NFL Players over the course of a lifetime!
Yeah I guess it makes sense since they have longer careers so they have to be more likely to do well, but yeah I guess I didn't know that
Good point. Did you hear of that rule for New Orleans cheerleaders?
Hello!  Do you watch football?
Yes, I love it. I'm a huge Patriots fan including Gronk and Brady. You?
Tom brady is one of the best players in the history of the NFL, he has won five super bowls and is one the best player to have won five Super Bowls, he is one one of only two players in history to do so.
Gronk was going to be traded but then he went into retirement after being traded.
I think Gronkowski is very important to the offense, so it's surprising that he was traded. He's so important to their offense, I can't believe he was trading away.
Yes, his inuries are catching up to him on the field and bellichick thinks it's affecting his play on the ball and inuries.
I think so too. Apparently Belichick doesn't like abrupt goodbyes for his players. He doesn't want to go down in history as one of the best players.
I wonder why Brady does that. I imagine it is because he's in uniform.
I think Belichick's position is fixed though. He's going to coach the Patriots as long as he's owner, and Belichick's going the coach the patriots as long.
Bellichick's prior gutsy moves pale in comparison to that of Brady. Do you include Gronk or Brady?
I imagine that a lot of people would be upset if Belichick got rid of Gronkowski or Brady, but I think it's more likely that he wants to give players more security as owner Robert Kraft has a lot to do with it.  Belichick has the security as Owner, so he can do whatever he wants.  I don't see him getting rid of Brady.
Bellichick has mastered his roster and team year by year with the salary cap and such.
I think Gronkowski is under consideration for a while, though, because of his health issues. He might be gone in a few years and I don't know who will take him in.
Agreed. He is the best player and missing a few games like he did this year hurts his stock, but he's also a good player and he's been doing well so maybe missing a couple of games like that this year hurt his stock.
I think it is making him indispensable some times though, opposing teams hate getting matched up with him, he just doesn't fit in well, making him indispensible.
He is a fierce competitor and it shows easily on the field. No one can question his competitiveness. He is the one that watches the most TV each week and knows the shows easily.
True.  I wonder if his demeanor is carefree compared to the ruthlessness of Belichick and Brady.  Maybe his demeanor isn't carefree enough to be able to take the ruthlessly of Belichick.
Bellichick has enough freedom to make arguable decisions, but he has to question his decisions when he has the roster. Kraft has the freedom to do what he wants.
Kraft really trusts him, I am sure.
I hope he can grab another Super Bowl this year.  I think a trio is going to grab another super bowl this year, I would hope.
I hope so. Do you think they will?
Do you watch American football?
I like to watch it, I do not follow it though I do like to follow it
I follow the colleges I attended, I was surprised to learn that the U of Iowa has a pink locker room for the visiting team, I wonder if that was for the pink locker Room or if it was for them to use for the other visiting team
Yeah that seems like it might kind of scare tactic, but I guess it works. Did you know that in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as football players? I wonder if that was because of football?
That's amazing! I know I graduated from Georgia Tech in 1983 and knew they beat Cumberland 222-0 but I never knew they'd beat Georgia Tech!
That is a huge defeat! I can't imagine losing that much! There is a running back that played for the patriots that never fumbled the ball in his career, he was a running backs.
Yeah, he did. I am grateful to ESPN. I like the green/yellow line on the line. It makes it so that the QB can't do political stunts. I think they should use that instead of yellow.
yes it sure does!  I wonder why they didn't use it in the 1970s?
I watch the NFL but when I google politics at ESPN I get no hits.  I do not mention that I do watch the NBA.  Do you know why?
I do not follow football.  I don't play, and I don"t watch it.  But you mentioned it, I do not play.  Do you follow football?
I'm a chiefs fan, from Montana! I'm from there though. Did you know the actual average gameplay in the NFL is only 11 minutes?
Yeah thats pretty crazy!  I know that a min fluffed can stretch into lik 2 hours lol,  that is way too much!
I played in HS and did a lot of standing.  They are putting chips in their shoulder pads to track information like their velocity and location.  It is like they're putting chips into our shoulder pads and our shoulder straps to track Information.
Yeah I hear they put one on the football.
I am a non-nerd engineer and supposedly the only NFL pro who does not make it to pro is an engineer.  So I am waiting for the nerds.  nerds all the time.  I am not a non -nerd Engineer and supposedly I could make it in the NFL pro.
That would be awesome!  I could totally see that happen!  Good luck to you!  You're going to constantly get injured and then nothing will happen! lol
 paper cuts are hell, a reluctant keyboard and the constant danger of spraining a finger is what I need.  I'm in constant danger.  Tom Brady is a little different.  Amazing that he has TD passes to almost every QB he has ever tried.  He's like Tom Brady.
I hear you there, the struggle is real, I guess hes a good QB, I am a fan of the patriots, Im not a fan I am an engineer lol, I hear you, the Struggle is real.
Did you know that he's never eaten a strawberry in his entire life? I have to re-think that because it doesn't taste like one.
LOL. I recently tried a pop once on facebook.
Thanks for the chat!  It was great!
Do you know who is in the pro football hall of fame?
I slightly know a little.
I was just reading about Ray Lewis and canton. I was curious about them.
Yeah, Ray Lewis rings a bell.  You read anything interesting about him?
I have.  It was an emotional story at his induction.  His mother was at his inductee's.  He said it was the first induction he has ever been to for his mother, which I can see.
That's sweet.  I don't know much about his mother.  What happened to her?
He has told stories of growing up with no momma.  I wonder if she's still alive.  He's made it through poverty and at the moment is in the moment with no one, but he's told stories.
Oh that was heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time! I remember when he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. That speech was so touching, and so touching for the guy to be speaking of his mother for the first time.
I did not know he was from the NFL, but I am a fan of all 32 teams.
I am a big fan, I love Seattle, I guess that would count as my favorite team if I had to choose I pick the Seahawks, haha, do you have a favorite team you are a big supporter of?
I like the New Orleans Saints, although their cheerleaders are forbidden from eating around an NFL player. That seems like a resrauarant to me.
I heard that.  That is terrible.  I think it is terrible that a Saints cheerleaders is eating at a restaurant and an NFL player comes in and has to leave, and the cheerleaders are like "you have to leave!"
I wonder if the same gender rule would apply to a female NFL player, I think the league has not had a female NFl player yet. I wonder if that gender rule is still around?
Nope, I've heard that a female made certain qualifications to try to join the NFL, and I think they had to go through 4 of them.  Kind of tempts me, kind of tempt me to try it.
That might work, but what if Cumberland lost 222-0?
Wow, what a loss!  I've heard of that before, I don't know if they had money to make something like that.  I heard that people make fun of big American flags at stadiums because they weigh 1100 pounds and cost $50,000 to make.  That would make a fun game related thing to do, but I'm just reading that it cost $40,000.  What a loss.  Did you know that American flags weigh about 1000 pounds and are the size of big american flags?  Wonder how many people make a game of it?
I know right, people and things change so much. In the 1960s, top bowlers and football stars made half more than the top bowl players, times have really changed.
Wow!  I wonder who bowled in the 1960's?  I never really liked it much.  I was just reading up on country music.  Country music is very different compared to the music they make today.  Dolly Parton, for example, got her break in country music by being inspired by Celtic music. "I've bowled my entire life, but not for the money!"  That's neat to think compared to now.  Hey, I think I'll go try it.
Cool!  I think it's sad that there are only 2 african americans in the country music hall of fame and that there is only one African americans who is in the Country music hall
Absolutely! I think it was Connie B. Gay who coined the term "hillbilly" for country music. I heard it was actually called that before, it's a good thing they changed it to "country music" because that's the actual term.
Yes, people love it. I mean, even rock stars like the Dalton Brothers from Galveston Texas, who opened up for themselves when they opened for the Rock on the Range in 1972!
That's cool! I'd like to hear them do something interesting like that haha. It would be interesting to hear what they sang like. I think that would be cool to see. The other interesting thing is that there is actually an album called "NFL Country" which is just NFL players opening for an NFL band and the stars of NFL country! That's a unique way to get music from the stars to the fans who probably love it.
That's pretty cool, I wonder if it's on Amazon?  I know that George Strait's cousin owns it, and he's actually George Strait.
Haha, yeah I feel like listening to some Dolly Parton!  It's been great chatting with you.  Yeah, I'll go listen now.
No problem! I'm going to listen to some jazz urban decadence!
I love watching the NFL. It was a disappointment that one of the teams didn't do well in the Super Bowl yesterday. I like the 32 teams in the NFL so that is a disappointment.
I really enjoy watching as well.  I thought the game yesterday was a really good defensive game yesterday, I didn't want the Patriots to win but I thought that was a good defensivegame, too.
Why did the Patriots win again yesterday?  Did you know that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay?  How did the patriots win again?  I know that there's only 11 minutes and 17 seconds of live play in an average NFL games.
Crazy, that is so hard on the body and the body has no goal of having enough time running between plays I guess.  But, there are some guys who end up recognized by going into the hall of fame, so that is a goal of theirs, and some of those guys who do, they do get into the Hall of Fame, crazy!
I know it is hard on the body, but with all the money they earn, I wonder how much lifetime earnings they have? I would rather be an engineer or an engineer for the money I have instead of a QB, but it is still hard.
Wow.  I guess the difference is the number of years they have to play.  If a woman were to play, I would let her if she meets the regulation requirements.  Do you think a woman would be able to play?
I did not know that.  That is great.  Unlike the New Orleans Saints which make their cheerleaders leave a restaurant if a player comes in.  It is so sexist.  They should have to leave, unlike the New York Saints which makes their cheerleading leave a food that a player is in.
I think they are trying to limit fraternization and also the professionalism factor.
Possibly. I wonder if they can track things like that. The nfl has even put tracking chips in players shoulder pads.
It is remarkable that the announcers can also bring their comments so quickly regarding details about the action and records being broken.  They always seem to be able to bring their words to the action.
I wonder where they put the tracking chips for the football. I wonder if that is used for determining where to put the Tracking chips?
I love the use of science in the sport, I am reminded of the good old guys who developed it, good old Guys who developed an American icon, the football.  It is amazing to see them in the Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, I think its amazing to be reminded of an American Icon.
It would be interesting to visit the hall of fame, I would like to see Tom Brady in the hall, but he is probably going to end up in the Hall of fame.
Yes, I really enjoy listening to the speeches they gave about their success. The Baltimore Ravens spoke of how loving and accepting they are of the nation. Ray Lewis of the Ravens gave one of the best speeches, "Heart is the New Normal."  I really like that.  He said a lot about the value of having a heart, and loving the nation and the people.
That was an awesome speech, I have never heard them give a speech before, I tend to be a drone when I do listen to celebrities but I do love it when I heard them sing, I listen to country music my most favorite, people sing so much, and I do like listening to it when celebrities do it, I also like country music, I like it because it has so much to do with country, I wish I heard country music more, I think it is the best way to listen.
George Strait was also related to Jeff Bezos. I like music that brings people together, not so much the ones that bring them apart.
I found it funny that in the 1980's, they dressed in costumes and wigs and played country music.  They opened shows for themselves dressed up and dressed in uniforms and w wig's and played Country music.
That is funny. I wonder if people recognized the similarity.
I have no idea, but lots of famous people like to finance country music. Henry Ford even helped out with it. He was afraid of the decadence of jazz, and was afraid that it would cause him to become a country music mogul.
Is he interested in country music? Is he interested? I like the southern influence in country, do you like theSouthern influence?
I love bluegrass and a lot of other styles. Banjos are awesome too.
I like all of the styles, but there is a country sound of today that reminds me of that.  Kind of like the music of the 60s and 70s.  Hey, its been nice talking to you!  I think I will go listen to some country sound music now!
Yes, they made great music. Simple ballads and dance tunes.
Hey there, do you watch the NFL?
Yes, I do.  I watched Tom Brady win the super bowl the first sunday in February, did you?
Cool. I don't understand how the game lasts that long when there is only 11 minutes of playtime in a game.
It was a really boring game.  Did you know women players are not allowed in the NFL?  That would be interesting.  I don't know why they aren't allowed in though.
Yeah I don't think women players would be allowed to play. I don'd like to see some women players in it.
Maybe it is because New Orleans doesn't want cheerleaders to eat in the same restaurant as the players.  No restaurant will let the cheerleaders in.
And the worse, if a player walks in, they have to leave if they are eating there, they can't leave if a different player walks into it.
That's pretty crazy.  I also see that they use tracking chips in the football to help track the cheerleaders for the game.  Do they really use that to track the Cheerleaders for a game?
Yeah, they have chips in the padding and other things likve tracking movement and statistics.
It's funny, bowling is an athletic sport, but football players do not make as much as football players.
I wonder how much they get paid for that?
True. ESPN did well with the creation of the virtual yellow line, winning an Emmy for the creation for it.
Unbelievable. Did you know that the U of Iowa locker room is painted pink?
Yeah that is pretty funny, but I wonder if that locker room of Cumberland is the same locker room that was defeated 222-0
Yes, that is very true. That would be a huge loss. Sad that they had to beat someone who was already beat up.
 patriot ellis is the only QB in the NFL to have never fumbled the football.
That is amazing, his entire career.  Do you listen to music?
I love country music, it's my favorite. It had its origins in folk and bluegrass and has origins in Folk.
Nice. George Strait and Jeff Bezos are cousins.
That is funny. I did not know that. I do like to listen to the music on my evening commute. I get a good deal on Amazon music. I've listened to genre such as country during my evening commuters. I think I'm getting a goodDeal.
Yeah, I wonder if people like Henry Ford is at least partially responsible for that. Nice chatting with you.
Hi! Are you by any chance a football fan? Not my biggest follow tbh. I find that all football is pretty fascinating. For instance I think it's funny the University of Iowa has painted the whole stadium pink, for instance.
I don't usually watch football, but I do like it when it is on in the fall.
Neat!  I dunno.  They used to put weight lifters in a pink room a few decades back in an experiment and it found that it would hold up today.  I wonder if they still have the pink room?  They probably don't put weightlifters there now.
Interesting. Why would pink be used for cheaters? Never heard of that!
I guess they're hoping it make the visiting team feel like they're weaker, I guess they are hoping it's make the visitor think that way. technically, a woman can be a football player, but there are no rules against it. Did you know that there is no rule in the NFL that says a woman couldn't be a player? It's just that a woman has to be at least 5'9" to be a quarterback, technically, so that means she has to actually be a Football player.
I think that is interesting, it seems like cheating, or at least it makes the other team weaker, I don't know if there is any scientific evidence for that but it is interesting.  I do think that it is cheating, but who knows.
I dunno, I think it is morally cheated.  I don't think it's morally cheating if it's the official rule.  It's like the color the locker room is painted or the flag that the color of the color that's the color they color the room is paint.  They have a flag in every locker room.
That would be cheating.  Why paint the whole locker room pink?  I don't know.
I assume they do, the color must be neutral, right?
Yeah. Did you know in the 1960s bowlers made twice as much as NFL stars?
Yeah I think I have heard that, I don't think they are that popular today though. A lot of the TV shows and stuff are about celebrity bowling and stuff like that, so yeah, that was back in the 60s I think, I think a lot of it was just for celebrity.
Yeah,  yeah I'm not too sure either lol.  That reminds me of that Bill Murray movie Kingpin,  weird name lol.
Yeah, that was a good film. Hard to believe an average NFL game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay.  How can it last that long?  An average NFL Game only has 11 minutes and 17 minutes of Live gameplay!
I did not know that, I think that is because of the commercials and play calling.
Mostly cheerleader interactions and the crazy rules about player shows and having to leave the restaurant if a player shows up and they are eating.  I know that they have a different team for every team and have different rules about Player/Cheerleader interactions.  They have their own crazy rules.
Yeah, I think a lot of teams have those, like the Redskins and a lot more.
I guess they real strict about the rule. It is a cya measure of not fraternizing with each other. I wonder what the rule is.
Yeah I think so. Apparently the NFL uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads.
Yeah, I was told that.  They do that for similar reasons I think.  The chip is used to keep track of things and tally up player stats, passes and distance traveled, etc.  I'm sure the chip is also used to record passes, passes, and distance traveling to keep keep trackOf things and tallied up player statistics.
Yeah, I wonder how they analyze that data. Well, nice chatting with you!
Hey, you too!  Have a great day!
Hi there are you a football fan?
I love football, how about you?
I'm a season ticket holder for my alma mater, the LSU Tigers and a Season Ticket holder for our alma matter, the Saints.  I follow the Saints in the NFL playoffs.  Did you know there is an NFL female QB?  I wonder if she's in the nfl female team?
I was hoping the Saints would make it to the Super Bowl this year. I think we will. I don't think we'll ever see a woman kicker though.
I agree.  I think the Saints ban it for that position because of physical contact.  They don't have a need for it because of the field rules and the no break-in and no physical contact position.  What I find unusual is the saint's ban on cheerleaders eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player.
I wonder if other teams have similar rules, I wonder if cheerleaders can be in the same restaurant as the players and if other team's teams havesimilar rules
I wonder what they think of the thoughts of technology in football. They have tracking chips in the balls and the players as well as in the tracking chips that they use on the balls.
I think that is a great idea.  It will help reduce injuries!  The chips track ball speed, location, velocity, velocity of the rotation, and rotation.  Also, they track ball's speed.
Yes, it's a good use of a training aid for the players.  Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the yellow line on the football that tells you where the first downs are?  That's where they watch the first down on TV.  I think that the yellow lines are good to have for the football.
I did not.  I did not know that.  The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
I did not know that.  I wonder how many minutes of the live one is live and the others are delayed broadcast or if it is just a televised game.  Did you know that there was only one televised game in 2001 that had a delayed broadcast for 30 minutes?
Only 11 minutes of the game are actual playing, the other time is spent on huddles and play calling and things like that.  So much of the time is spends on huddle and play call, it seems.
Do you follow Ray Lewis at all? He is in the NFL hall of fame and he is up for induction.
No, I did not.  I did know U of Iowa painted the opposing team's locker room pink!
That's intimidation, not humiliation.  A bit like a preacher on fire.  I wonder if that's what Ray Lewis did in his hall of fame speech, when he did a two minute monologue during his hallowed hall of Fame speech.  He was a bit of a threat off the field, but maybe a threat on the field too.  Intimidation?
I know he was charged with murder at one point and time and was charged for it.
Yes he did. His speech was passionate about breaking down boundaries, using sports heroes to build legacies bigger than sports and contributing to the community.
I like a lot of his ideas.  Did you know that Green-Ellis went his entire NFL career without fumbling the ball?
No, I didn't know that, but found it very interesting that he is in the NFL Hall of Fame.  Did you know that his grandfather was also in the Hall of fame?  Bobby Beathard's induction speech was written by country music star Tucker Beathards grandfather, which I found interesting since he wrote a song about country music.
Wow that's cool. I love country. I like it, what about you?
I like the older stuff. I don't really like the newer stuff.  I like pop music, like George Strait.  He is the best at the older style.  Did you know that Amazon's Jeff Bezos are cousins?  Do you know who he is?
That's cool! I love George Strait! Good talking to you!
Hi!  How are you?  Do you want to discuss football?
Hi, how are you? I didn't know that Brady's jv high school football coach refused to play him because he was a rb.
I heard about that. he adored Italian a serie, even as a teenager.
Me too!  I think I was one of the favorite too!
Alessandro Nesta, Paulo Maldini aand Francesco Totti lol..I like Paulo Maltini a and Francesco totti lol.  I heard that ESPN won a lot of awards, I wonder who it was?
That is pretty ingenious!  I wonder what that field goal attempt line looks like?
Yes that is right! The highest score ever for a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0. I am shocked that is the highest score I can imagine LOL.
I don't know, lol! I find it funny that the visitor locker room at Iowa University was painted pink!
lol,  thats funny!  Do you have a favorite quarterback?
I'm a huge fan of Baker Mayfield, I also like Halo 3, but I'm not a huge user of Halo 2
wow so cool. I learned that Alex smith took so many AP tests in high school that he entered university as a junior, took so much AP tests he got his degree in 2 years and became the best quarterback in the NFL draft.
I do like him, but did you catch his gruesome leg injury a couple of weeks ago?
I didn't, but I did like the fact that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL.
No I never even thought of that, I wonder if there are any other left handed QBs?
I didn't know that. What is your favorite drama movie or book?
Sicario.  What about you?
I did not like it.  I will have to walk to remember it, my childhood favorite movie.  Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor for a TV drama, earning $700,000 per episode in House.  He is the only actor to ever earn that much for a single episode, earning only $700k per episode.
I did not know that, how did he act in that drama?
To be honest I'm not sure, I haven't seen many of his movies yet.  I know he is a celebrity now.  The actor Michael Caine got into acting because the prettiest girls at his school were in drama class.
Michael is one of my all-time favorite actors!
Do you like drama movies?
He costars with Steve Martin in Scoundrels, which is a comedy, so I like him.
Hi there do you watch the NFL?
I do. Do you like Kellan Moore?
I've heard the name, Brady is he?
I do like him. Did you know moore was the only left handed QB to ever be left handed?
That is cool, I wonder how he got started? I know they resevre that he was Brady's in high school and he started
Wow, they lost talent for sure. Brad Johnson threw for 50 touchdown's in HS and only one touchdown.
No, I didn't. What did he do?
I don't know.  I wonder if that is possible with the history it has had
Yeah I guess. Did you know Alex Smith finished college in two years?
Yes he was smart. Do you like drama?
Yes I do. Have you ever seen House MD?
Yes it is a good show, Jon Hamm is in it, he looks like Jon Hamm
I do know Hamm, Laurie made $700,000 per episode for him, but I think Hamm got $700k for each episode he was in
Yes that is a lot. Hamm used to be a drama teacher and one of his students was Ellie Kemper, and oneof his students Was Ellie Kempers ex-husband.
haha that is funny. do you listen to radio dramas?
No, I don't but it seems interesting.
I like them. There is a free website I would be interested in seeing if you are interested in it. It is a Free
Yes that is very nice and convenient and free,
Yeah I know. Do you know why Michael Caine became an actor?
No, I had no idea. Did tou know Patrick Stewart teaches masters classes in drama in the UK?
Nice, I wonder if all of the pretty girls in his drama class take the drama class. Caine became an actor because of thePretty Girls
hi, do you watch football?
Heck yeah, I watch American football during the season.  How about you?
Yea, I watch both college and NFL, I'm kind lol.
Yeah I like college and the NFL. The highest score in a football game occurred between Georgia tech and cumberland and it was 222 to 0. That is the highest score ever in a college/nfl game.
Thats an insane score, I would quit at 100-0, I wonder if there was a mercy rule created after that game lol, I think they had a mercy Rule created for that game LOL
yeah, that occurred back in 1916, not in modern times.  I wonder if that occurred in modern Times.
Wow, I heard about that, a long time ago!  Do you have a favorite team?  I like the Iowa Hawkeyes, they are my favorite team.
Yes, Iowa State. Did you know that the locker room name is true to the lockerroom?
I believe it is true, it is the University of Iowa.  It is the college of the pink for the university of Iowa, so it must be true.
Wow! It is funny that the drama genre is so dramatic, and not so funny when it comes to the dramatic.
Yes, I love some drama, especially drama shows like House!  I think that calming color is useful for psychology purposes.  It can be used for drama shows.
Interesting. House is awesome. I like Hugh Laurie. I think it makes sense he makes $700,000 per episode for it.
I know, that is so much money per episode!  He made the show awesome.
No doubt.  He is the highest paid actor ever for a tv drama.
Awesome, worth the money, he is one of my favorite quarterback, who is yours?
My favorite is probably Baker Mayfield, but I am glad he went pro in video gaming instead of football.
I'm glad he didn't go, I wonder who he beat in that Halo 3, that makes me think of him lol, I don't know who to beat, I would have done it lol
That is one match I could not match.  Did you know Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL?
My all time favorite lefty is actually a QB, but I enjoyed the Michael Vick too.  Nice chatting with you.   Thanks for the arrest.
Yeah I forgot about him, but he was a surprise, and smart. Alex Smith is good too, he is really good. Nice talking to you, too.
You too. Enjoy your day!
Hi, how are you? Do you enjoy watching football?
I do.  I've seen a lot of the teams I've been to play on a lot over the times.  Mostly I'm primarily a Broncos fan.  Are you a Bronco fan, too?
That's cool.  What is your opinion of the Broncos, Peyton Manning or not?
Losing one player in an important position like the QB is an understatement. He was able to make the team crumble but he is still the best at the most important position. He will make theTeam crumble again, I think, losing one player is always a understatement.
So true. The Patriots were always iconic, and still are.
That is true with rgiii.  Brady really starts to look tired sometimes, and the other team starts to falter.  He is good at running to his targets, but the other quarterback look amazing.  The other team has to make a couple of great plays to stop him and he just gets tired.  But when Brady really start to get tired, the other side gets a little tired, too, because the other QB can't play as great.  If the game is really good, then the otherteam can't falter, and Brady can play.
I wonder how people feel about that, including me.  I know I think a lot of people think he is the best, but apparently not a lot.  Patriot Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his career.
I think rgiii was a good player, but his play style was not the best.  He got a good rep for having no luck, but it is hard to have an excuse for that.  Some players end up getting bad luck most of the time, like Alex Smith.  I think if they pay you well enough to have a spot, then you will have a good time.  It is hard though to get a spot on because of your play style, and some players don't have a chance to get that good rep.
I don't get the stuff that goes on there haha.
Sadly, I'm at the low end of knowledge for football, sadly.  I know a few people on the low, but not enough to work in an office.  My Texas HS team has some huge fans.  The Texas HS high school football stadium is bigger than the office, with a capacity of 17,000 people, and the high school has a lot of football fans.
That is cool. Alex Smith got his bachelor's degree in two years and then began working on his masters in only 2 years after that. He is a great QB.
I think Alex Smith is very dedicated to his job and his team members comment that he and the others in the league, in addition to education, are hard workers and are the best of the league.  I think he has a job to do in addition of education, I think the other team members commented that he is very hard workers.
Do you like drama TV shows or movies?
Ive always liked dramas,  mostly sci-fi/fantasy type.  I like Sci-Fi the best.
Did you know that the actor Hugh Laurie from house, making $700,000 per episode is the highest paid TV drama actor? making $800,000 an episode
I used to enjoy that show in the beginning, but I think it went a bit overboard in the end.  I don't like dramas, they are too melodramatic and have too many stories, and I don'm not sure how they ended up with that many episodes.  But, I do like some of the stories in those dramas, but they are a bit over-the-top at the beginning
Jim carrey doesn't play in dramas anymore because he feels they don't bring any type of positivity.
I had heard that before. I think people need to get used to multiple genres. Patrick Stewart does a comedy voice and also teaches drama classes, so there is a style to his style.
I think he was a wonderful actor in X-men.  I think he's also a wonderful actors in Star Trek.  Did you ever watch it?  American Dad is good.
It is a fun show, short on drama, but decent for comedy. Lots of cameos from the actors, lots of cameo's, and short on Drama.
I love the alien roger, he is hilarious.
It's his comedy style, I like him.  I like Orville, but I didn't know there were real actors who had the chance to do it.  Do you like comedy style?
Hi, do you like football?
Hi there, I like football, I dont get much chance to watch these days though.  How about you?
I don't know about the sport very much.  I do like the quarterback position.  It kind of takes the whole team into a situation when you have a QB.  The quarterback is the backbone of the team, the quarterback is like the QB in any situation.
Yes, QBs are so important.  They are smashing the ball carrier, and the defense is so important to have a QB on the ball.
Wow, cool. Do you know who created the circular huddle?
No, I didn't.  I think it was created long ago in the history of the game.  The coach shrouded in the mists of time, or maybe the history is that it was actually created by a coach shrouded by the misting of time?
It was created by a deaf QB who was created in 1946. I found interesting.
That is great. Who would have guessed that a deaf player could do so great?
Paul D Hubbard was the one who had to create a new language, sign language, to create it,
that was clever of him. i bet he wasnt a left handed QB though. that would have been his job.
I'm sure it was, but I wonder why he was the minority since the left handed are the minority.
In my opinion it is.  He is not a persecuted minority.  The NFL is a persecutedmajority.
I think it's because there's only one left handed QB in the NFL, Kellan Moore. He's the only one.
Yes!  I wonder if he was deaf or something?
That is super special, and he is.  I think he is the player gave importance to education.
I bet he did! I forget the name, did you like Alex? I will never forget him
Alex Smith.  The bachelor with the record.  He had the bachelor's for 4 years.  That is quite the record!
Man, that is a hard working genius! I bet he will be great as a QB, I bet!
I bet he is, a great leader and I bet he can get any team going, the highest score in a football game in 1916 was 222 to 0, highest score ever, I think it was in 1916
Yes it was by Cumberland.  That game was a shameful display, the coach of the game was the one who said, "We can do what we want." It was a travesty.
Wow, it is something I find very pleasing talking about sports, I do not think it happened in 1916.
Yes, I enjoyed our chat as well.  Glad we could do that.  I'm going to have to get off here.  Have a good evening!
You too, thank you for your time.
Hey, do you follow college football at all? I don't. I'm hearing about that Notre Dame quarterback named Ian Book, but I don's follow college basketball at all
Hi, I dont follow football much but i do know about Ian Book.
He's one of the QB's at Notre Dame. Apparently, he's a California native, apparently, and he was one of only two quarterbacks at Notre Dame who had a real down season in 2016.
That's great he has the chance to play for Notre Dame, I love football and think he will be a great QB,
Yeah, I used to follow it as a kid I always wanted to see him play for Notre Dame.  I loved football as a child and I still feel the same way.  Do you like good dramas?  I liked the movie Rudy as a little kid.  It was my favorite.  Did you know that the sucker from the movie Rocky wanted to play for ND?  Do You like football?  My favorite QB is QB.  He is a good QB and I feel like he is one of the best QB's ever.
I like sports films, I guess Hoosiers is good, but Rudy is a fun film, based on a true story, so I like sports/sports films, and Rudy was actually a really fun film and I guess hoosiers was also based on the true story
Oooh, I've seen Hoosiers. I think Michael Caine is in that movie, but I can't really mix it up. He was Gene Hackman in the movie.
Oh, yeah it was Hackman.  I think it was Harry Dean Stanton.  Did you know there was a movie based on the true story, Harry Dean Stanton?  I didn't know that.
H Hackman was not one of the replacements for the football movie.  I have seen a lot of soccer movies.  A lot of football movies since it is the most popular sport worldwide.
Yeah, I think he was in Bend It Like Beckham too. There are many soccer films, but there was also a film about Pele, and a film that was about Beckham, and also a movie about the Bend it Like Beckham, but I can't think of any soccer films
I think I saw that one. I forgot about that. There were also some Rugby films, I think.
Yes, I like Morgan Freeman, Matt Damon, and South Africa. invictus.
Oh wow.  I figure Matt Damon would played for them.  Rugby have quarterbacks who are the equivalent of QBs in the US.  They must be pretty good.
I dont know rugby, but i think the captain would have some sort of key role, or maybe the captain is the QB?
Yeah, I kind of watch highlights on ESPN, but I never tune into it.  I usually watch highlights of the US vs the UK.
I dont watch espn much but I make a point to go to a game if I can.
I like to tune in to ESPN for the scores.  I like their superimposed yellow line representing the first down line in football games.  Did you know that ESPN has a yellow linerepresenting first down for football games with the superimposed line representing a first down?
I guess it was obvious to add it. There was no benefit for viewers so it was just a bit of technology to make it happen.
I would have won an Emmy if it won an emmy, I think it would be appreciated more. It's a hard enough time following football without that first down line and it's well deserved.
I think that the superimposed graphics do make it easier to follow.  Anyway, great chat!
Same to you. Take care!
hey there!  Do you watch football?
Hi, I watch it a lot.  I live near Boston so I'm a Patriots nation epicenter, but live in the midwest so I watch a little of it.  Not a Chiefs fan though.  Are you a Chiefs or a PatriotsNation epicenter?
Did you hear how Univ. of Iowa painted their visiting teams locker room pink?
That is kind of funny! It is soft and feminine.  I wonder if it is to distract the football coaches from the game preparation or make them feel more feminine?  The department of defense employees say they are trying to distract them from football and the department of Defense employees are trying not to be soft and female.
That is weird, I would have to agree with you on that one.  I also didn't know that bowlers made more than NFL players in the 1960s.  Bowlers made about $5,000 more than players!
I guess there is not much justice in society. An average engineer over the lifetime made more than the average engineer.  But the average NFL player only makes about twice as much as an average MLS player.  It's shocking that Allen, Texas holds the record for the highest salary for a QB in the NFL.  I guess there was less football in Texas?
I have not been there either.  Did you hear about how the football huddle was created?
I am familiar with it.  Brad Johnson threw it to a deaf guy, and the deaf guy used to lip read the plays for the other team.  I think Brad Johnson did it with his lips because he could not lip read.  It's ironic that the coaches would use a clipboard or paper for the plays but not his lips.  He had to lip READ.
haha I saw the video, that is really cool, I'll have to give that one a try haha, did you know there is a Patriots player that has never fumbled the ball evry time, he has never lost the ball and he's a patriots player, he never fumbling either!
haha I know! I live near Boston, I think it's ironic that the only african- american qb won superbowls against Denver, and has won superb Bowls against them!
I did not.  That is ironic.  I also think it's weird that ESPN won an emmy for creating the yellow line in football games.  They are the ones that did that.
A talented man, Russell Wilson was a Yankee in baseball.  He was a yankee in baseball, but is from Seattle, and is under contract with them now.
I didn't know that. Alex Smith got his bachelors degree in two years and he has a Bachelors Degree.
I'm a Chiefs fan and a fan of his.  He got traded for $1 in 2005 after he broke his leg as the guy they were using.  Then they traded him for a $1 and got him for the MVP year understudy Patrick Mahomas.  The actor Jon Hamm taught Ellie Kemper, Erin, and the guy who was the MVP's year under backup, the actor Jon hamm taught Ellie kemper how to play the saxophone when she was just a little kid.
Wow, interesting!  I did not know that.  I also didn't know that Hugh Laurie gets so much money per episode of House.  He gets $700,000 per episode!
Wow, I didn't realize Hugh was paid that much for a show.  I like that Patrick Stewart teaches master classes on the set of the show. Makes me laugh.  Did you realize Hugh is the only one who has never been fired from the show?  Patrick Stewart teach master classes!
I like Jim Carrey's movies, but I am sad he wont do dramatic roles anymore, have you seen any of his Jim Carreys movies?
I do like him, but I know he went around the world for action. I guess since Aristotle's Poetics, the earliest known Greek work, drama is derived from a Greek work that used sci-fi as drama. I wonder if Truman show was any more dramatic than the earliest one, like a truman show?
I read that somewhere.  That is interesting and it is not that long ago!  They invented the genre in the 30s.
He invented the theory of drama, I guess, I wonder if it was his theory of story art or just a story of dance that he wrote down.  I know that we are told that we have been dancing since the cave man a thousand years before him, I think.  So he wrote soap dancing and passed away some day and the theory was invented.  He passed away and the art is still there, in the art of dancing, I believe.
Interesting. I love soap but hate operas. I like soaps. I hear free classic dramas are available on a website where you can hear free classics.
Do you watch football?  Especially American football?
I do, I watch it sometimes.
Yes I do sometimes.  Back in 1916 Georgia Tech scored 222 points when they defeated Cumberland in a game.  The score was 222-0.
I wonder if they pulled the old skunk rule, the one with the skunk?
I am not sure.  I know in the sixties bowlers made twice as much as football players though.  Back in the 1960s bowlers didn't make as much money as football like people do today.
Wow! Today, engineers make more than the average football player.
I had no idea they made that much.
With football players only averaging 5 years of actual career time, that's only 2.5 years of actually career time.
I imagine good players can no longer make it. Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the ball in his entire NFL career.
He was a good running back. He played for a while. I think he is one of the last longer ones in the NFL. He was like 34 or something, I think. I don't know how many years he has been in the league, but he was a really good runningback.
That is very surprising. He did play for the Patriots for 6 years and had a record of 21 years with a record.
I'm not sure, but I'm sure he did, he was on the Bengals, not the Iowa locker room.
I don't know. What locker room did he go in?
I guess it is a psychological ploy?  The visitor locker room is Pinnk's, I guess that was a psychological tactic
I wonder if it works.  I wonder if Alabama and Clemson have one?  It's good to know.
I like the third quarter. It is a nice ritual when the kids come out and wave. I hate to see the kids have to go, but it is for the kids in the cancer hospital.
That is a nice ritual. ESPN should show it to others. Do you know the yellow line they use for the yellow lines? ESPN winning an emmy btw for it.
I feel like the emmy lowered the bar a lot.
It is odd that it makes the game more interesting by knowing that the team is on the line, it makes it more interesting to know what team has the line on the first down.
I agree, and I think it's functional.  I wonder how many white guys running on the sidelines with the three yard chain on the sticks and the 50 yard chain would be functional.
The long situation with the first down shows the viewers the exact line and adds some drama to the line and shows the listeners the viewers how far the line is.
I always wanted to be a quarterback and lead my team when I was a kid. Sadly, sadly I can't.
Hey, greats like Tom Brady did not happen.  Did you play in high school?
True, but some of them were really good in school.  Alex Smith was a good fit for the fit.  He was working on his masters before being drafted.
He was smart.  A good education is very useful.  Most players go broke 5 years after leaving their sport.  60% of players goBroke within the first 5 years.
A quarterback at Oklahoma almost quit football to compete in gaming.
I am glad he stuck with it. It doesnt sound like a profitable venture.
Yes I know.  There is no way a left handed quarterback has an advantage in baseball like a lefthanded quarterback does.
I didn't know that. I wonder what the history of that is? I know he had to throw.
I'm not sure, but I know the huddle was invented by a famous deaf quarterback so the other teams couldn't read his signs, and that's why the huddles were invented.
It's amazing what people can do when they intend to, and turn something into something iconic.
It's goofy the way some things go.  Like U. of Iowa painting the visiting team locker room pink.  That was the only thing the other teams could think of to get away with.  I can't see the U.S. team from U of Iowa Painting the visitingteam locker room Pink.  How goofy.
What? I wonder if that locker room was pink from a 222-0 loss or something else? That must of gotten into their heads!
L laugh that must have been a very common game.  It's a shellacking for sure.  Bowlers made more money than football players back then and bowlers made much more money now.
That's too bad.  Hard to imagine what the pay for bowlers would have been like.  Good way to pay for football.  Better pay for Bowlers, though.
That is a good question. I bet they probably made less money than ESPN. They got an Emmy for the superimposed yellow line. I think it was an Emmy but I don't really know how much it really was.
I think the yellow line is genius. People want to watch live so the yellow lines help.
It is needed for folks like Green-Ellis who never fumbled for the Patriots in his entire career.
That's pretty impressive.  The Patriots have been one of the most dominant teams recently, for the most part.
Did you know that in high school, Tom Brady play for the Patriots? They made the right decision in not having him play for their high school because that is where he made his name.
I bet they are regretting that decision now.
No kidding. Tom has won 6 Super Bowls.
hey did you know Virginia tech and the notre dame will beat them?
I like Georgia Tech my alma mater, I think they are home and I know the guy Iian Book is the QB, it would be hard for anyone to beat them, acc, but Georgia Tech's alma maters are so far away from home
I think European Book is a really good QB. He is a top player. He has thrown for over 400 yards and 6 touchdowns in his first start.
Yeah, I think that was the book as well, and yeah.  I was wondering if Georgia Tech plays Notre Dame, since they are an independent in a conference.  It's amazing that he did that and his team, but I'm wondering ifGeorgia Tech plays notre dame because of the book?  They're not an independent, they're a conference team.
Yeah he is amazing, who is your favorite quarterback?
I remember when I was in college.  It was Ryan.  Georgia Tech won the nat'l championship in 2016.  I think that was the year when Georgia Tech winning the nat'tl championship.
Yeah I don't remember him either, I think he was probably back in college lol.  Baker Mayfield was also really good at video games, he became a professional video game player.  I didn't even know he was a quarterback back in College lol.
I think that coach Kelly is a book in a book.  I think that nothing good will happen to him.  He got injured with video games.  Nothing is going to work out for him.
Yep, he's a smart guy, a Master of His own, Alex Smith, smart guy.  He was accepted into the NFL draft, but not accepted in the draft.
I know he was smart academically, I did not know he is that smart. I did learn that Snoop dog and his son's HS fight song is his son HS's fight song
That is cool, sounds like a cool way to hear it.  Do you know what the top scoring football game of all time was?  That sounds like it was the top score in 1916!
Georgia Tech and Cumberland.  That would be something to be proud of!
That sounds like a blow out lol,  I would like to see that game on television I think it was the Patriots against the Patriots
I am a Chiefs fan.  Btw, did you know that 14 of the 25 largest stadiums in the world are for American college football teams?  That is how many are for the american college football team.
Wow that is impressive. There is a former Patriots player who has never dropped the ball, benjarvus Green-Ellis, he is the only one who has. He is a Patriots player that has never drop the ball.
That is amazing. Same with Brad Johnson who threw for 50 in the superbowl.
I didn't watch that score, but it sounds incredible. I didn't know about the deaf quarterback creating the circular huddle. Did you watch that? Sounds incredible!
I think it's very admirable, and interesting that he had to play that way, I think it was very admirable. I enjoy watching dramas more than watching football, but I do enjoy watching football.
I do like watching dramas. Michael Caine is a great actor, he is in so many.
I do like him a lot. Did you know Patrick Stewart also likes drama and teaches master drama classes in the UK?
Patrick Stewart sure seems like a good guy. Apparently there is a website where you can listen to old classic radio dramas. They are free online. I wonder if you can actually listen to them, they are usually classic radio drama and they are freeonline.
Hi! How much longer football will exist in the current form and in what way?
It seems obvious that the game has caused a lot of injury, but I'm not at fault.  The risks are so obvious, it's hard to take the risks.  I think the game had its fault, but the game's caused a lots of injury.
I guess the question is if NCAA officials knew of the potential for so much damage and injury, if they knew, what did they do to prevent it?
I think they just feared the possibility, there is too much money at stake to stop the game, and it would be a liability to admit fault, there's enough money at risk and too much liability to admitting fault
Exactly.  And money is just too much.  I think flag football is a better way to use the time and the money.
Maybe that's the thing, but I wonder if there are enough players and enough representation in college.
Yeah, kids take a lot of risks when they are playing.  I think boys need to be encouraged to try and play tackle football, but I think it is not for kids.  Boys need to know there are a lot more risks in playing.
Sports are important, but they involve such risk of injury.  I think it is wise not to allow kids that are too old to compete.  But youre right, there are plenty of other ways to compete that do not involve such chance of injury, like baseball, basketball, basketball (soccer), baseball, tennis, swimming, etc.  The list is endless.  Do you have any kids?
Yeah.  I like swimming better than basketball.
That's good, the country is dedicated to gridiron gladiators.  14 of the 25 largest stadiums belong to US college football teams and the world famous american football stadiums belong in the world's best football teams.
Its a big sport.  It is a big money game with lots of money.  The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  Lots of commercials and the like.  That is why the average NFLgame only has about 11 minutes and 17 seconds of live play and lots of commercials.
Yes, and the cost is so high.  The football stadium in allen, texas seats 18,000 and cost $60 million to build.  I guess it's similar to the one in alen, tx.  A football stadium for school and the pros, cost $70 million to built.  That's so much money in 11 minutes of gameplay.  How much money does it take for the 11 minutes to be so high?
Dunno, I'm not sure. I know they make way more money in the long run. Their careers are very short so in the end the average NFL player doesn't make as much money as an average NFLplayer.
True.  I dont see how you can manage money in the league if you dont have the financial knowledge to do so.  You figure that you control no financial knowledge, but you have to figure it out.
Yeah, financial education is critical, I'm more of a literature person personally, so I think financial education
I think a financial education is as important as a literature one if you're a player. The olympics have a literature in it.
I have no idea, I guess they want to have a full spread of culture. I hear there is a contest for the worst possible opening sentence to a novel, I would guess it is a fullspread of culture, but I have no Idea how they come up with the idea.
That's terrible! I would not want to go there. I figure that there is some good stuff in there. "It was a dark and stormy night, suddenly a shot rang out. I went out to figure out what was going on.  Suddenly a shot was all I saw.  It was terrible!"
Lol, that would be a lot of fun!
Kind of like the comedic fantasy author Terry Pratchett, who was knighted for his services to literature for his opening lines of his novel, "Kind of a horrible, horrible, terrible, great chat."  He was opening up a great chat!
Dunno.  It was nice talking to you as well!
Hello there, do you like watching football?
I love watching it. How about you?
I love it too! Do you have a favorite college and NFL team?
I like both. I like all teams but my favorite in the NFL the steelers are my favorite.
Nice! I like the Vikings as well. Have you heard of the University of Iowa Hawkeyes for college?
No, I have not.  I wonder why they painted their visitors locker room pink.  lol
Interesting, apparently pink is a calming color.  lol  I think I like it as well.  It is a very calming color for sure.
In the day, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars. Times sure have changed since then.
The salary must have been a ton less then, so the difference in the difference of the salary is a ton now. How times have changed.
It probably is.  I'll take a hint and say it's reveresed.  The higest score in a football game is the higest ever, when Georgia tech beat cumberland 222 to 0.  That was in 1916.
That score was the 80-0!
222-0. What a blowout!
Wow, that is insane, Cumberland had to quit football after that game that is for sure.
Lol, me too.  ESPN won an Emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line, I had no idea they did that!
That was so helpful to me, I used to love that line. It was never real growing up.
lol nice.  Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the ball in his career.
That is a great feat.  Maybe he can teach a clinic to other RBs.  I would be down for that!
I agree!  They are also putting tracking chips in the players shoulder pads and footballs to track data.  Did you know that?
That is awesome! I wonder if they will ever use it in my life time. It was developed by engineers who make more money than players so I wonder how much they can do with it. Well, nice chatting with you. I think I will go look into it more now, they are developed by Engineers who make much more money that players in their life time!
Probably due to having longer careers and the NFL only having 11 minutes of live gameplay.  I would have liked to see more.  It was fun chatting with you!
Amazing! Enjoy your day!
Hello, do you like Tennis?
I love and watch it a lot! What about you?
Nice me too. Polo shirts are no relation to the sport but I like polo shirts.
Yes it was invented by the tennis player Rene Lacoste in about 1904.
Yes and other players just adopted them after him so he became famous
Yeah. No black man has won the US open since 1968 and no black man hasn't won the U.S. Open since 1968
Yea that is weird.
Yeah, they once used a helicopter to dry a Tennis field in 1968.
Wow desperate times call for desperate solutions I guess,
Yeah for sure. Do you know how long the longest game laster?
Yes it was a total of 31 hours, which is 3 days for a total 11.5 hours
Yes that is way too long. Do you like the NFL? I don't watch it, I don'm not really into it, but I do like the NFl
I don't really. Did you know Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink?
I wonder if that is supposed to have an effect on the opposing team, or just the opposingteam?
I wonder that too. Bowlers used to make more than football players.
I guess it was more popular back then.  I didn't know bowling was that popular.
I guess so. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
It was 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland!
Yes that was in 1916 vack
Yeah. Did you know women can play in the NFL?
Yes as long as they qualify, there are no rules against it, I wonder how they would qualify
Are you a fan of football?
I am a huge football fan, what about you?
I love football both college and NFL. Who is your favorite NFL team?
I'm a New England Patriots fan and huge fan of Tom Brady. What about you?
Nice, I'm a Vikings fan, but I've been getting hot of them as of late.  Did you know that the University of Iowa Hawkeye's like to paint their opponents locker room pink?
I did not. I also did not know that top bowlers made twice as much as top football players in the 1960's.
That is crazy! That difference in salary must have been substantial, right?
Probably, I wonder if the NFL has a rule like the bowlers do. The rule was only implemented in the 1960s and it is a contest football players make more than bowlers.
I do like the new rule, what do you think about it?
The rule is that the opposing player has to lower his helmet and initiate contact with the opposing team if he is about to lower its helmet and initiated contact.
That is awesome!  I think it is awesome that it is allowed,  I would have liked to see that back in the day if it was allowed, but back in my day I don't feel there were any safety concerns.  I am sure there were,  but I am not sure if it would have been good player
I think it's a great rule. protects the football players. it helps decrease injuries and the head injuries.
That is a huge problem. Engineers make more money over their lifetime than NFL players, though.
That is an interesting fact.  I wonder what year will the NFL and the AFC merge?  Do you think they will merge?
I'm not sure, I think it was in 1932.  Is Trump an owner of an AFL team?  He owns a QB?
Donald Trump was the owner of an AFL team after the merger of the two leagues was completed in 1960.  I think he was the only owner of the AFL team at the time of the merger
I think so.  If youre a patriots fan you may have seen Benjarvus Green Ellis in the league the last year or two.  He's coming out of the NFL next year.
I loved Benjarvus Green Ellis.  I read that he has never fumbled once in his career.
That is outstanding in my opinion, he should teach a clinic on the old era RBs.  It was great chatting with you, have a great chatting, have an outstanding day!
Awesome chatting with you too!  Have a nice day!
Thanks! Enjoy the weekend!
I don't really watch the NFL. I know the Redskins are upset about the new rules. A lot of teams are.
I watch it from time to time.  I think they are on the up and up to date to date with what is going on.  Did you know that the coaches are the highest paid in the game?
I guess there is some confusion about the penalty and players are not suspended for it.  I think they are.
Yeah I guess so, it's confusing for sure, they need to start changing things and not keep doing it so long, that is too long.
Yea, apparently players and coaches are already complaining about the rules from the preseason.  Do you know why?
Yeah, that's tough. I don't know the reasoning behind it but I think that it's supposed to be a tough, contact sport.
I find it unfair other players like running backs are getting in trouble for the same thing.
Yeah I know.  Did you know there is a football stadium in Texas that can seat 18,000 people.  I wonder how many people can actually seat that many.
No, I have not. That's pretty crazy. I have never been to Texas though?
Yeah it sure is, it cost 60 million and on top of that is a high school stadium that is the top of the cost!
I love football in Texas, but I don't care for it as much in the US. Too bad it's not here. I think it's important to get an education. I love football, but it's also bad that the average engineer makes more over their lifetime than the average NFL player. The average engineer Makes about twice as much as the average nfl player.
Yeah, good point.  Did you hear about the tracking chips they are using on the players?
Yea they put the chips in shoulder pads as well as footballs to track speed and stuff.
Yeah and I think they are using that data to make the game safer. They want to reduce concussions.
It's crazy how dangerous the NFL is, considering the average has only 11 minutes of live gameplay.
Yeah go figure.  Matt Patricia is a scientist that turned football coach.  What a change in career for him.
Yea, I wonder if he gave Benjarvus Green-Ellis advice on how to coach the New England Patriots after he gave up fumbling the ball twice in his NFL career?
I know right!  Amazing how he managed to do that!  On a different topic do you use the library a lot?
Not as much as I used to.  I knew there were more libraries than McDonalds in the US.  Did you know that?
That's a pretty cool fact. A kid in malawi read from books. He managed to build a windmill that brought power to his village and managed to get it to build itself. He had a wind farm and a little windmill. That's what it takes to read from Books.
Nice talking to you! I have to get going.
Hi.  I'm glad that the NFL is taking steps to make the sport safer.  There is no rule against certain players.  It's hard to believe that the rule was around in the 1920s.
I agree.  There is a rule that a player cannot lower his helmet and initiate contact with the opponent.  That is really fast and they have to make a split second decision.  A player cannotlower his helmet  and initiatecontact with the other player or the opponent, but he can still initiate contact if he needs to.
It does seem like that. I wonder how many of the players who have been playing the game for so long and then suddenly change and become a lot different.
I agree. I think they should be putting more tracking chips in the players shoulder pads, putting them in them as protective measures to help develop new ways.
Football has come a long way from the days of leather helmets. I look forward passing those on to the next generation.
I notice that the shoulder pads and protective gear are a bit smaller now, you would never notice.  I think that is part of the problem because they made the players a little faster, and the shoulder padding made the Players a bit bigger.  The problem is that the vicious hits and hits from the shoulder pad are just a little bit faster.  lol
Yes, the athletes of today are bigger, stronger and faster.  I think there is too much focus on nutrition and training in all sports, but not in these sports.  With more focus onnutrition and training, the athlete will only become stronger and Faster.
That's true.  The NFL has no written rule against female players.  If a girl comes along that makes me think of a "girl" I wonder if she will ever play in the NFL.  They have no writtenRule against female Players!
I can't imagine. It would be tough to get signed to a team, imagine.
I guess so. lol  The NFL is the American professional football league, formed in 1946 as the National Football League.  It was first formed as the Professional Football Association before renaming it to the NFL in 1949.
The APFA? The NFL sounds a lot different.
I think it does lol. The NFL merged with the American Football League in 1920, so today, the NFL merged into the American football league.
I think it is similar to basketball.  They used to have separate leagues, the NFL and the NBA.  I wonder why they merged into the NBA?  Maybe because they merged with the ABE?
I don't follow basketball as close as I do baseball and football, but I do like basketball as a whole.  Back when I used to follow basketball, the pay scale wasn't quite right back then.  The top bowlers in the 60s made more than NFL players!  I wonder what changed that for them in that era?  The pay scale has definitely changed since then, and baseball and Football are way behind.  In the 1960s, the top bowler made twice as much as the top NFL players.
The NFL players make about $12,000 a week, so I wonder how much top bowlers make.
lol  The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is Higher than that of an NFL or MLB player.  Probably because engineers have longer careers and the average lifetime Earnings of an Engineer isHigher than that for an NFL/Mlb player.
I would imagine that they have to play for a while for sure, the average NFL career is only 5-6 years long, so those guys don't make the higher level salaries they would like to make, but at least they play for more, theaverage NFL career isn't that long so they would have to make the Higher level salaries
I agree. Did you know that ESPN won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line on the first down when ESPN won a Emmy for "The Color Line"?
No I didn't know that either. It's hard to imagine watching a game without the first down line.
Wow, I read that in 1916, Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0.  That's the highest football game ever!  That is too bad!  Georgia Tech beats Cumberland in that game?  Wow!
I know, right! The coach of the other team resigned after that, he had to go back to the locker room!
Hi, do you like to watch football?
I don't watch it regularly but I usually watch the superbowl. How about you?
I do too. I get bored watching it during the regular season, playoffs and super bowl. That's about four weeks straight, playoffs, playoffs & super bowl for 6 weeks straight!
ya that is really boring, I think that explains why there is only 11 minutes of actual gameply in a football game, that is not enough, only 11 minute of actualGameply
Yes, and the score at the end of the game is the last sight of what was actually a score.
I heard about that game, Georgia Tech beat Cumberland in 1916 and man they must have hit 100-0 haha.
haha I can't even imagine that happening. The NFL has no rule that say females can't play in the NFL. I wonder why they have that rule?
That would be crazy, and not a surprise to me.  I know the Patriots have a player who has never fumbled the ball, and he is the only player ever to have done that, and that is the Patriots.  That's crazy!
Benjarvus Green-Ellis. I would feel terrible if I had broken that record and had to feel terrible about it.
ya I don't know if I would like watching football that much, I worry every game haha, but I like that ESPN won an Emmy for creating that little yellow line that you see on tv for the yellow line for the first down!
That is pretty cool.  I thought players made a ton of money but apparently engineers make more over the lifetime.  Always thought playersMade a ton and engineers make even more.
That is shocking to me. I know the NFL uses tracking chips on the players and I know that they use stats on them, but I didn't know the nfl uses tracking chip on the other players.
Yeah, technology is so advanced in the game now.  The player shoulder pads are so advanced now too.
Yes it sure has.  Do you like to read?  Apparently there are more libraries in the USA than there are mcdonal's in the US!  I wonder how many libraries are in the us.
I do, I use to have a library card, but I don't really use it now.
That's good, I have a library card apparently, more than half of USA adults have a card, that's about half of usa adults!
That is reassuring. There is a library in California where you can borrow things like sewing machines which is pretty cool, and you can even borrow things from the library
Wow!  What is nice is William Gladstone who donated his entire book collection, 32,000 books, to the library when he was 100 years old, wow
He carried all those books in a wheelbarrow to the library!  He had to get a wheel barrow and go to the Library!
That is equally impressive!  A man who was wrongfully imprisoned and spent four years studying law to prove his innocence.
Yes, good for him. I think he did well for himself. Thanks for chatting with me, have a great weekend!
Thanks! Keep track of your library card!
Hello, did you know that Wikileaks had some of the emails from the Trump and Stone knew about. I wonder if Trump had his hands in the emails
Yes, in fact they did, I believe it.
I think so, the email to Bannon back in October proves that.
It is all fake news.
Fake news!  I mean a copy of my email was published a few times and daily caller's and the news is still fake!
I know, right?  Haha, it was heard directly from someone who said "these rags can perpetrate nonsense like that".  The telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation on the phone, either by phone or by phone.  It can be a telecommunicationsDevice that permits 2 or more user users to use the device to conduct an conversation.
No matter how much there is evidence that comes to light I think Mueller has the focus to shed more and more evidence and maybe some actual truth will come to light in the end no matter what.
I think they will come to the same conclusion, but no one knows for sure how forward we will go.
Lol, yes I am as well, I am looking for the conclusion of collusion too.
I can't rhyme or it.  Did you know the last president to speak a foreign language fluently was FDR?
I didn't know that!
Trump is illegitimate president because he was elected even though he was losing the popular vote. He was elected by the greatest margin ever and even though losing thepopular vote.
I wonder if we would have had the runner up in the election become VP, and the runnerup become VP like it was up until the late 1800s. That would bring some order to the chaos of the election.
Yes, that would be something. Bill Murray used to voice the human torch in the fantastic four radio show.
Did you know Canadian radio shows have to play at least 40 percent of Canadian music?  Tons of Justin Bieber.  I wonder if that is Canadian music, or if it's Canadian radio.
Egad! Who is your favorite?
He's ok. My grandfather once told me a story about how he made his own radio using a razorblade and a pencil. I wonder how he did it!
My grandfather macgyver? How did he do it?
Yes he was.  One thing I can tell you though is he is no soldier, soldiers did not have time for such a thing.
Wow, that's cool.  One of the most popular radio acts in the 1930s was a ventriloquist, a fact which baffled contemporary critics.
If you like free classical dramas, I have checked out some free classical drama on the radio.
I haven't, have you?  What about in the present day?
I like classical.  How about you?
Merry Christmas, we'll have to check them out. I have to finish this thing though. I'll have you check them later.
Me too.  I'll have to take some time to listen to the radio.  Do you like to listen?
Yes, me too!  How about you?
Do you listen to the radio?
I do. I do, but only in the car. How about you?
I do as well. Did you know you can catch Jupiter's storm on the radio?
Wow, I had never heard that before, I would love to hear that, it is amazing.  Soldiers in WWII could make a radio with rudimentary parts, a razorblade and pencil, I wonder how they did that?  Soldiers can make aradio with rudimentary Parts, I believe.
That is amazing! I wonder if they could capture all the channels?
That's a good question.  I'm not sure.  There is a website where you can listen to old radio dramas for free.  Those are quite entertaining.  If you like radio dramas, it's probably better to listen to them on the website.
I haven't listened to them but I would like to.  Do you speak any latin?
To an extent, I know a lot of the medical terminology in college so I have some Knowledge, but not a lot.
Apparently there is a radio in Finland that has the news in Latin.
That is odd. Imagine if there was an audience for that.  Off topic but do you happen to know the top three wealthiest US presidents?  I know they are not the top two but one of them is actually one of the top 3 wealthiest US Presidents.
I know that it was JFK, Washington and Jefferson
Yes that is correct, did you happen to know when the guest house was built on the white house?
No, I do not, I think it was bigger than the White House? I think the White house is really big, right?
Yes I wonder why it is bigger. I would assume it is because it is there. Who made that decision?
I am not sure but they probably didn't want to be seen using their phone.
Yes I do! I worked in a call center for a long time, I hate talking on the phone so I mostly text, but I worked at a callcenter, so I use my phone quite often, how about you?
Did you ever use a rotary phone?
No, I did not. I was too young. I didn't use one for a long time. How about you?
Yeah that was ages ago, I think. Did you ever use a phone book?
No, that would take a long time.  I don't use it online.  Did you know that the cables that carry our internet and phone data across the ocean are only 2.7 inches around and only go under the ocean and are not actually 2.8 inches?
Wow! that's long.  Nice chatting with you.
Telephone and the telecommunications are the most important devices ever invented.
Did you watch the State of the Union last night delivered by President Trump?  Surprisingly, he was not one of the three wealthiest presidents in American history.  He was not even one of three wealthiest Presidents in American History.
I did not.  I think that's a negative.  He has a net worth of $100 moneof $ and I think President Banana fo Zimbabwe has a mone of $300M.  Wonder what his net worth is.
Possibly. Did you know that Washington, JFK, Jefferson, and Jefferson are the wealthiest presidents in history.
I wonder if the president of Indonesia has any pop albums? Sounds like it would be up President Trump's alley...he has 3 pop albums
For a while, the runner up in the election became vice president, can you imagine Trump working with Hillary?  Can you imagine that?
I can't.  I do know that the guest house has a guest house though.
Good question. I don't know. It's ironic that it's larger than the white house, but it's also larger than it's not.
I know it is, I was just in NYC once and it took longer to dial on a rotary phone with a rotaries phone than it does now.
Did you know NYC's area code is 212?
Did you know an iPhone is so powerful it is more powerful than the entire US nuke deterrent system, no matter what you do with it.
It is amazing how much computing power dependent on the Iphone.  It is amazing they have an Ichi cable laying on the ocean floor.
Back in WW2 soldiers could make radios with just a razorblade and pencil. That's way more secure than todays devices!
I bet those soldiers could, the razor blade must have been really strong, hard to hack a razor blade I suppose, and I wonder if they could separate two books that had overlapped pages, you know that you can't separate 2 phone books that have joined together by having the overlapped Pages, I bet those WW2 soldiers had to be strong, I wonder how they did that, and how they got the phone in there, hard for me to hack
That's impressive.  Helen Sloane Dudman's strong enough to have bought 100 radio stations!
Yeah, that doesn't sound impressive to me. I haven't listened to them but I have listened to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas online.
She preferred nuntii latini.
I like her too. Kinda like Canadians prefer Canadian radio.  They require 40% of the music played to be Canadian.  I think Canadians prefer Canadians.
I wonder if the president of Indonesia gets any airplay?
Good for him. I wonder if he was any good.
Maybe it's the President Banana?
It was a pleasure chatting with you!
Same here.  Thanks!
Hi, how are you?
Hello, I'm doing well!  Do you listen to the radio at all?
I do, mostly when I am driving, how about you?
I'm not surprised that Jupiter has radio storms that can be heard on AM radio.  I'm surprised that it is so far away.
I wouldnt mind hearing that,
Me too, I wonder what they sound like, and what they look like.  I wonder if aliens can even talk to you?
i dont know. maybe they have picked up sounds from space that make them seem like aliens.
That is pretty wild. In Canada, at least 40% of songs played have to be Canadian and at least 50% have to have been canadian.
I'm not surprised. I wonder why they do that?
Yes, soldiers made simple radios using a razorblade and a pencil, you could blow up the radio with a razor and a Pencil, and blow it up!
I would like to Google that.  What do you think?
yah, i heard it's the reason why NYC area code is 212, I think I have seen a youtube video on it before
I dont know, I have dialed it all my life,  but I dont like it.
I do not use a rotary, but the fastest number to dial was 212, so that saved me some time because it was the fastestNumber to dial on a rotaries
Wow, I never knew that.
yah, the word for telephone comes from a different word for Telephone
I never knew that!  What's it?
I like Unicef donating a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you do not use your phone.
I do.  That is a great idea.  I think I would do it.
I wonder if people have ever tried to separate two phonebooks that have their pages over lapped? I have no idea how one could separate two telephone books that are over lapping but I would think people would have the idea
I am not sure.  I think it is a little strange.
It is a mystery!  Great chatting with you, I hope you have a good rest of the day.  I'm going to go walk now.  Hope you have one!  Take a good one!
Howdy! Do you like the radio?
Hi, how are you? Radio is convenient for easy background noise and a fascinating tech.
I think the radio is also good for drowning out my wife and kids when they are complaining about hunger.
Did you know that Canadian radio mandates that a certain percentage of Canadian music played on the radio must be Canadian.
I think that the Canadian radio industry is too much in the way of nepotism to keep foreign bands off the airwaves and not enough talent, so they want to keep up with foreign bands.
There is a web page dedicated to classic radio dramas, there are many resources there, totally free and there is a whole web page dedicating to classicRadio dramas, I would like to look that up!
I dont know if theyll ever get there though lol,  I dont think 80 percent of the canadians have the internet and I dont know how outdated things are preserved,  theyll probably need to get it from somewhere.  LOL  But its great that some old and outdated things is preserved.
I think it would be worse if it was totally in Latin, like Nuntii Latini...not Canadian, but totally in latin...lol...the Finnish broadcast of the finnish broadcast...
I guess the Canadians have no idea of dead languages.  So 40% Canadian Latin...lol.  I like my idea ofdead languages.
That's absolutely mind-blowing that a dead language is used in the news.  I know that the access to information is very restricted, but still a lot of people have a right to know about the 'news' and status of the world around them.  Soldiers cut their own pencils to get information on their current lives while in foxholes.  Access to information in a dead languages is absolutely mind -blowing.  The world would be a different world if a lot more people had a right, and a lot less people had the right to the information.
I guess foxholes are a crucible that inspires creativity and that is great! I'd like to listen to some latin right now, but I don't know if I would listen to it.
Thank goodness that we have the telephone now. I wish I had a personal connection to the globe but it's not as convenient as electromagnetic waves, but the cables on the ocean floor still transfer information across the globe even when it's off the telephone.
yes, the telephone has changed my life, I curse the man who invented the phone though, the telemarketers, the spam calls, the spam, the curse the person who invented them all
That's fair. I hear about it every once in a while. I have to turn in my block due to auto calls that are just plain robotic spam. I turn in the numbers I block dueto auto calls, but hear about charity numbers and they give clean water to kids in need for just plain old numbers.
i figure that the sun could explode and people wouldnt notice unless twitter told them to, bloody phones. the sun is so old. the Sun could explodeand people would not notice unless Twitter told them. i would help kids get water for all the kids.
Poof! vanished.  Like they're preaching to the choir!  It's crazy that a phone has more computing power than nuclear missile deterrents.  We're going nuts here in the world and the phone is just preaching to us!  Crazy, it's going nuts!
Fair enough, but I wonder if texting on an electronic tether is robust enough for a nuclear deterrent?  If it explodes it's not good for us.  I hear the need for the electronic tethers is because texting is more than texting on a nuclear deterrence.
Yes, it could easily be a recipe for disaster if we let the president find a way to blow stuff up. Twitter is not bad but it could be a bad way to keep occupied with other hobbies. The president can be in different places on the planet, easily. Twitter can be occupied with different hobbies.
I shudder to imagine all the hobbies involving pop albums.  I have too many.  Anyway, great chat!
Haha, yeah, I am trying to keep things interesting. Yeah it was nice to meet you too, keep it up.
Nice to meet you too, have a good one!
Thank you! you too!
I find all of the articles interesting.  I have a background in technology so I found the one on the telephone very interesting, and also the one about the radio.
I loved learning about radios and telephones!
I remember getting a message from someone saying there was a Russian radio frequency called "one way signal" and I'd love knowing that I was reading about it recently and it was actually a Russian Radio frequency.  I've been into all kinds of things over the years, but I can't remember the name of it.
ya thats crazy deciphering cryptic messages, have you heard of foxhole radios?
I have not heard of them. What is that?
Soldiers in WWII made simple radios using a razor-blade and a pencil, they used a razor and a Pencil.
Wow!  Thats incredible!  It's crazy that an iPhone is so powerful that an iphone is as powerful as the building of an entire intercontinental ballistic missile defense system.  That is a building!
I find that hard to believe, how do they even measure that.
I'm not sure, but I do know that a lot of places use that technology for heart research purposes for sure.  It is amazing that the healthcare industry is using floppy disks for computing power.  I know a lot that work for the healthcare and heart industry still uses floppy disks because they are older than the technology that we work with now haha.  So, it's amazing how far we've come in technology and technology is used for research purposes.
That is crazy.  I think I still have my floppy disk somewhere.
Lucky us!  hahaha  They can fit one low quality song in there in 16 megabytes!  That is more than the average song in an average song.  You could fit one of those in my CD and I'd be able to fit it in about 3 megabytes.
Wow. I wonder who head a Jupiter radio storm?
I have not. I have heard of storms on Jupiter that are very powerful.  A supermassive hurricane always spinning at 4500 miles per hour (6000 kilometers) and winds of over one hundred and fifty miles per second can be heard on Earth.  It must be one of the most powerful storms on the planet.
That is crazy! I wonder what the storms sound like on the radio.
I wonder that too, I might tune in just to see what they sound like. How do you feel the President of the united states would like this chat haha.
I'm not surprised that he is not one of the top 3 wealthiest presidents. I wonder who the top 4 are?
I'm surprised by that as well.  Inflation, and maybe it's more of a beast than business background, but I'm expecting the president is more of the beast when it comes to decisions he has to make.  I don't think he can make them.  He's more into show business and politics and what not.  The president is a different country and a different beast than Business, but that doesn't mean I'm not surprised.
I don't live in the US but I have heard about the president of Zimbabwe, do you know who he is?
I have read about him. His name was Banana.
I did not either! I wonder if that is his real name or just a nickname, I wonder why he went with that?
I'm not sure if it was his real name, I'm surprised the Indonesia president didn't use his time to make songs in office.
I would listen to him for sure. Well it was nice talking to you.
Hey there! Do you enjoy listening to the radio?
Hi, I do. I like to have it on in the background when I am working or driving, how about you?
Nice, I like it while driving too, but only occasionally use it too. I wonder if occasionally it can be picked up by a Jupiter radio storm?
I have not either. I wonder what I am missing out on by not playing on Jupiter radio.
True.  A finnish radio station began broadcasting a weekly news program in latin in 1989.  I wonder how many listeners it has?
I bet it finally gave people who majored in Latin something to listen to.
lol  In Canada, 40% of the music played on the airwaves has to be canadian, and 40% has to been Canadian.  I'm not sure what that means.
Canada has some decent bands like Barenaked Ladies to fill in the music slots.
Yes, Canadian.  I have never been much of a radio drama fan, but I do know that there is a website where you can listen to thousands for free.  Are you a radio Drama fan?
I didn't know that either. I wonder if that is still big or if radio has been around since the days before television. I think I listened to drama on the radio in the days of the old days before Television
Basically the big form of entertainment. I bet some presidents even tuned into it. Did you know the three wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson?
JFK surprises me.  Maybe with inflation, he is worth than President Trump but I can't see Washington or Jefferson, even JFK surprises me!  I wonder if it's because of inflation?
JFK is a bit surprising. He made a lot of albums, too. I bet the president of Indonesia made a few pop albums. I'm sure he made a LOT.
I think recording 4 albums must be a long process, recording 3 albums at a time and then having enough time to actualy run the country, I think it's a long processes.
I agree, I don't know.  I also didn't know in 1805 the runner up automatically became the vice president, kind of makes sense but I don' t think it would work out well to have the runnerup automatically become the vice President.
It wouldn't work at all.  The parties hate each other too much.
I think it would be more productive to work together on something else.  If we stayed at the presidents guest house, it would probably be bigger than the White House.  I wonder if it is bigger than our presidents guest room?
Presidental mistresses, diplomats, celebrities, celebrities.  I bet they have wild parties there too.  Probably athletes and other athletes.
Sounds like a good TV show.  A lot of radio drama too.  House, a radio drama, is a good example.  It was lovely chatting with you today!  White House is a lot of computing power - the entire US nuclear deterrent, if white house was a TV show, would be a good tv show too.
I think there's a lot of phone usage in the white house. I wonder why they're still using floppy disks in there
Rotary phones are so archaic, I wonder if they still use rotary phones
It was good chatting with you.
Do you listen to the radio much?
I do, a Hanson song is really popular but I won't reveal theartist because they don't want to reveal the artist
Wow I guess people are drawn to mystery. Do you listen to the radio?
I like mystery and I do like to listen to it.  It has amazing things on it.
Yes, and Jupiter's storms can be heard over am radio.
Wow nice one. A ventriloquist was a popular act on the radio in the 1930s, he was a ventrilloquist
wow that is very interesting, do you listen to radio dramas?
No not really but I will have to check them out, if any are good, are they good?
I think they are, I should definitely check them out, there is a free website for them
Yeah, it is nice. There is also a radio station that turns solar energy into tunes.
No I didn't know that that's cool.  In WWII soldier made foxhole radio using pencils and razorblades.  I wonder if they were still around when WWII soldier's made fox hole radio
That's very creative. Do you use your phone much?
I use it all the time. Do you know why the NY area code is 212?
No idea, I think the inventor of the dial phone was an undertaker, I wonder what he used it for?
Very cool, I wonder if the area code was because it was easy to dial in a rotary phone, or because the NY area code is 212 because it is easy to call on a rotational phone
Dolphins can communicate with each other on the phone by using one side of the line, and then the other side of that line.
Cool.  Did you know that radios in Canada are required to play at least 40% Canadian music?  It's a law.
Wow that seems a bit excessive, but hey Lamarr helped with the invention of the cell phone, so who knows, maybe he had something to do with the invented it,
Nice!  There is a radio station in the Finland that does news in latin and it is in the radio station that I know
That is cool.  Nice chatting.
Same here, you have a great one
I use to listen to the radio a lot, it is a great form of entertainment at this age it is still a greatForm of entertainment, how about you?
I love listening to the radio. I think that the tech is getting old but I love listening.
It is interesting that radio waves also occur naturally, I wonder how that happens.
That is cool, the inventor was a real genius, he did discover that, what an invention.
I don't know how they were discovered. I learned that you can pick up radio signals from Jupiter at home and that its storms are intense enough to pick up AM radio (not regular am radio like we have here in the U.S.). I wonder if this would occur naturally or if it was discovered. Jupiter's storms are fierce, but not that intense.
There a lot of cool facts on the radio, the news program was created because of a latin news program. I didn't know that.
I guess listening to the news in Latin is a good way to learn how to learn it. Do you know much scientific about it?
That would be great! I wonder if you can understand a word of latin, but it does sound like it would be a nice show.  There is a website that has thousands of drama episodes for free, I wonder how you could understand aWord of latina from it?  That would be like thousands of Drama episodes for $1.
I think I will check that out, I can download them all for streaming, but unlike the TV show, I cannot download a whole radio drama, so I will have to try it out on TV, I will also check into a radio drama that is streaming. It would be nice to be lost in my imagination, unlike the tv show.
I have no idea, ive just heard about that site recently,  I think its a cool site I might download them,  no idea if you download them or not,  its a really cool site.
Do you have a smartphone or a rotary phone back in the day?  I used a rotaries phone back then.
I did use a rotary phone my grandma had one back in the day, phones have evolved a lot over the years, the phone my grandmother used had a rotar phone, it was only in the 80s, phones are so far different now,
I think things have come so far since those primitive electronics.  I was at a yard sale recently and saw a old computer (a 16-bit computer that had computing power) at less than $30.  It had been decades since I've used primitive electronics for anything.
Same here. Did you know that rotary phones used to be the area code for new York, that's why New York has the 212 area code.
I was thinking that it was because it was the fastest code to dial and then I looked up rotary phones and it turns out it was 212, I looked it up rotARY phones were so worthless lol, I wonder what they were thinking.
Yeah, they are worthless!  I prefer smartphones.  I can't believe how much power an iPhone has.  That is insane!
The iPhone is so powerful that it has more computing power than the US nuclear icbm deterrent in a single year, and I wonder how much computing power that is?
It's amazing how much power you can have in your pocket, kind of scary our nuclear deterrent doesn't have that much power in it, needs to be updated asap,
I think that is the logical reason.  The average person holds too much computing power on the hand and if it goes offline to upgrade, it goes down.  We need it all off the hand for a while.
Yeah I guess that makes sense. Did you hear about the campaign UNICEF is doing to get clean water and children? I think it's really scary, it's to help children who don't have clean water.
I have not, I decided not to make a call, but I have made a donation and will do so. Speaking of phone, it was nice talking to you. I will make a donation now.
I'm contributing too! I live without a phone, I need to live without it too. Great chatting with you as well! Bye.
Hello, do you know any technical aspects of telephone?
I know how cellular phone works, voice in transformed into electrical impulse, encoding into the data then transmitting by cable, and the data is transmitted by cable.
I see, so that explanation is making more and more sense
There is a lot of technical data in it.  Like that NY area code is 212 because it was chosen because it is easier to dial on a rotary phone.  I wonder why?  I know NY area codes have been chosen because they were easier toDial on a Rotary phone
I think that is reasonable considering the history of the city and the fact that New York is one of the earliest established cities in the US. I think it's one of our best known cities for that fact.
Yes.  Some big cities have been around for a long time.  I think the phone was invented in the late 20th century.  Probably in the 1930's.
I find it really amazing how much phone and internet data is conveyed.  The 3.8 inches in diameter cable on the bottom of the ocean, where phone and Internet data is transferred, is only 2.7 inches in circumference.
Yeah, 2.7 inches is not a lot compared to thousands of miles, but it does seem like it would snap from time to time.
I agree with you on this issue, and btw, I agree that it would be worrying if there was some sort of backup device to store these information in case the cable snapped.  At this point, it's more just wondering what the point is and worrying if it did, but they have a backup device in the backup device, so maybe they have some way to store this information in CASE the cable snaps.
I know right. It's designed to system is not broken but people would probably notice. I wonder if the cable went under your kidneys, the kidneys are not designed to have a cable like that.
I concur, thats a good analogy.  One kidney is sufficient for survival.  2 kidneys?  2 is enough?
Even as complex as phones are, I think computers built for the iphone are not as powerful as the computer of the system.  A computer has more computing power than the computing power of the whole US nuclear system.
I'm not surprised by that fact, in fact I am surprised that so much energy is consumed by the iPhone for that kind of power, so much of it is energy.
I am not sure. Computers are so efficient and so much power is used for so little power.  Radios are so much smaller and much more efficient.  Did you know that someone tried to invent the walk-man?
I think cell phone and computer technology has come a long way in invention. I think we are better off with the use of long distance. If we could use that invention to help clean water, we might not need to go without water for a day. Unicef will donate clean water to a child in need for every minute you do not use your cell phone. I wonder how much water is needed?
Interesting, I wonder if texting counts or using voice over the phone or texting counts?
I'm wondering if it does or not.  I think the phone brings so many benefits but I wonder if it is for purpose.  Do you use your phone for any purpose?
I think they make money off of non-usage of the phone, so it's a way to make money.
I think it is fascinating that soldiers in WWII used a razorblade and pencil to make a simple radio. I wonder how they did that.
That is so simple! It's all about tuning and the principle of the simple. A radio is catching an electrical wave and then the emitter/emitter is the speaker, so if the radio iscatching an electrical waves, you can hear it through the speakers and so you can know which one you are tuning to.
I did learn something new!  That is really interesting!  Btw, it was very nice chatting with you, I think I am going to go enjoy your holiday now.  Thanks for all the interesting ways we can learn.
You too. Thank you!
Bye!  :) 
bye!  Have a good one
Hello there, I love to read! What type of books do you like to read? I like to write but I also love to reading romantic novels
I love to read those romantic ones, but I also like reading about the basketball, reading has always been one of my favorites ever since football season started, how about you?
Sarah Maccabeean recommends them in her Washington Post column. I'm not a huge fan but I like her novels.
I'm not familiar with her work. I do follow a couple of sports and read her opinion piece when she's on the way to work.  I read a couple for this chat.  One was that the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting teams is painted pink.  What's that all about?
I have not read her, but I am going to look her up. I think I will look up her list of sport authors for books as well and see what she has to say about her. I do not know if she is on my list of science authors for book.
No, I have read some books by Michael Lewis and Ellie Kennedy but recently I have been into some books on football. I like books by michael lewis and ellie kennedy but recently there has been a debate about the dangers of football and head injuries. There have been several articles and articles that are convincing enough to feel like there is a debate.
I know a lot of facts about NFL and I'm lost for words, people like football and there's a lot to like about it, I watch the Superbowl and there are a lot  of facts, the game only has 11 minutes of gameplay and only 2.5 hours of air time so in just over 24 hours, the NFL gets almost 3 hours of play time in a game, I'm sure there are people who watch the superbowl and are lost for Words, the Super bowl is only 11 minutes, I like the game, it is very fun and a lot about it.
I feel like they beat them at the ads, haha.  I know the average lifetime earnings of NFL players are supposedly higher than that of engineers, but supposedly they don't even beat the average average lifetime average earnings of average engineers.  So I find it hard to believe! I find myself saying to myself, "how is that possible?  How can that be?  I feel like the ads should be the ads.
Damn, engineers made more on the stem field back in college.  I have another factoid to add to the future discussions.  In future discussions, I will tell everyone I was an engineers made much more on a stem field.
Yeah, that's what all my kids ever wanted to do.  As opposed to most humans.  I can't believe professional cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as NFL players.  Saints cheerleaders is forbidden, but Saints cheerleader are forbidden to eat in the very same restaurant that NFL players do.
That sounds like borderline discrimination.  I guess they don't want cheerleaders to influence the game.  Or maybe it's just previous encounters of bad press.  It sounds like they have had many previous encounters with cheerleaders and don't need cheerleaders for the cheerleaders.
Yeah or gender bias.  I'm not surprised.  It seems like the #MeToo campaign surround that rule.  Did you read about it anytime recently?  I read about the rule but haven't read about what it is in any way.
I guess I don't think it's touched on in the metoo moment, but there is no written rule against them, I guess. There are no female NFL players, so I doubt that will ever happen. I'm surprised that there is a written rule at all.
Yeah, that's a good point. I think that's wrong. I would imagine that there is no rule against it. Females can play if they meet certain physical eligibility requirements. It would just be difficult to get in. I can't imagine having a time meeting all the physical eligibility requirement in some leagues without any rule, so yeah, I think you have a good idea of what I mean.
I think it is to give people a run for their money, muscular females would take the spot of the best in the world.  They could give people  a run.
Yeah, women can be more aggressive and strategize better. I would love to see them use tracking chips to monitor and record the players move around on the field. I wonder how they get the data from the tracking chips and use it to help the women to be moreaggressive and strategizing?
I wonder if baseball will ever do something similar. I know that the Harvard mathematic research team has an attempt to bring statistics to the baseball game in an attempt for a "comparable" statistical game. It sounds like they're trying to use the latest gadgets and the latest technology in an "an attempt tobring statistics to baseball."
Haha, I think it would be cool to track.  It could be used to force force tackles.  Also, to see how fast a quarterback can throw a ball.  I know that their contracts for salary are adjusted to see who is the fastest player to get the most tackles.
I doubt the franchise would ever adopt new technology that would have data that could help them.  I think a lot of the data is probably from retired football players, who are old enough to fashion game play and use it.  So, maybe that's why they won't adopt new tech.
Good point.  I like football, but I also like to watch comedies and find bromantic comedies to be more popular and funny.  Did you know that?
I love Harold and Kumar and I love Harold & Kumar. I love White Castle burgers!
Haha yeah I would love to go for burgers at the white castle.  I've never been to white castle but I would definitely go there if I had the time and the money.
Me too, I'm gonna head out on a burger run soon,  have a good one!
Hello!  Do you follow football?
Hello, yes, I do, my favorite is the Dolphins, they are one of the best teams out of 30 teams, they really are good, do you have a favorite?
I think they started the season pretty good, but I'm not sure who plays for them this year, lol.
I think so. I love to watch it because there are only 11 minutes of gameplay.
Crazy, you don't really notice that during a live game.
I love all the behind the scenes tech that they use though, specifically the chips reports that are in the players pads that show every move.
That's a lot of the tech stuff they use. I wonder if it helps player safety.
The CTE is scary. Engineers make more over the lifetime than players. They are compensated for the risk.
I think parents with children interested in playing should watch that concussion movie.
I think I have seen Concussion, it's a comedy. It's about a concussion, but there's a humor in the topic. I like comedy.
It was good, I thought it was a good one.  I thought the whole issue was a joke, and the usual Will Smith movie was the issue.  They will continue to do the usual will smith movie.
The movie was bad boys.  Not really Will Smith's best bromance movie.  I like funny bromances like that of Harold and Kumar, Bad Boys, The Hangover, pineapple express.  Harold and kumar are one of the best, and the hangover is another funny broma movie!
Yeah I remember watching bad boys!  It was pretty entertaining.
Yes!  My favoite sitcom was Friends.  I miss it.  3rd rock from the sun deserved the golden globe.
I liked Friends. Great show. 3rd Rock was ok, but Friends had more talent. I was more of a Seinfeld fan.
I love that comedies generally have a happy ending. I love to smile and laugh.
Yeah. Comedy is pretty hard to do right.
I would not gamble on comedy, but Demetri Martin seems to have a natural talent. He left Harvard Law School to take a gamble on Comedy, and it paid off!
That's true, and he paid off in the long run. Bill Murray said that Kung Fu Hustle was the best movie he ever saw. It paid off for him, in the movie and in the money
I love Bill Murray. He is my favorite! I am not familiar with this quote, but I love Bill murray as the ghostbuster. I loved Kung Fu Hustle, he is my second favorite.
Yeah that was one of my all time favs growing up as a kid! And yeah he was always nice to say. Well it was nice chatting with you, I hope you have a good day!
hey there, I guess the top 3 richest presidents in history were the richest presidents?
Yes, that would be Jefferson and Wasington, how about you
I know that Trump is in there, and JFK, but I always thought it was JFK, weird.
Wow, I guess he had a lot of money back then.  I did not know that.  The guest house is larger than the white house and the guest house of the white House!
ya that is odd, do you know who the first President of zimbabwe was? I think his name was President Banana haha, I wonder why
Yeah, maybe that means something else too in their language?
ya I don't know, maybe, President Banana Shoudl release a pop album, like the Pres. of Indonesia did haha
Yeah that guy honestly, I think he is good enough to be president, I don't think he would be good as a pop star though,
Haha I'll have to check that out. I also want to check out if teh runner up of the election in 1805, teh runners up of that election became the pres, Trump and Hillary would probably release a pop album together. I would like to see that in the white house right now haha
hahahha that would be funny. Did you know the white house has twin buildings in ireland and france?
haha I did not know that, I wonder if the interiors have similar paintings and desks or if they are completely different, I mean if they have twin buildings they must have similar artwork and the intermins have similar Paintings and desks
No idea.  I wonder if the presidents of other countries use the same one.
Good question. I'm not sure! Maybe they wrestle wild animals haha, Teddy Roosevelt used to wrestle wildAnimals, he was pretty awesome, I wonder how he did that
I heard he was. Did you know that he banned Christmas trees from the white house?
Yes and he also gave a speech and then after being shot in the chest, he continued giving the speech haha.
That is pretty amazing.  Did you also know that the white house still uses floppy discs for the floppy discs?
Haha I think I heard about that, they should be more advanced than that haha. Do you know how old they are for solar panels?
Do you watch football?  I do.
I watch it quite a bit.  Im glad the Patriots won the last Superbowl.  Did you know that there was a teammate of his who never fumbled the ball in the superbowl?
Yeah that is pretty amazing. Good for him. Did you know ESPN won and Emmy?
I did not know that!  The yellow line is a great invention and it was the first one ever!
Yeah, it is, it really is. nice chat
Are you a fan of football?
I like college football, my Alma Mater, and college football in the US
My school's team is good, but not good enough to get in. The highest score in college football is 222-0. I wonder if that's because their school team is really good or the highest score ever?
I think our team is not good or bad, we just have our ups and downs.  The WVU mountaineers are the best in the state and we share the same fan support and community support and Community for the team.  I do not think our state has a good or good football team.
I think that's fair.  I think we all support other teams to some extent, but we should support other too.  The University of Iowa is the only one to paint visiting locker rooms pink.  That's not fair, they paint visitingocker rooms pink!
I think you're missing the point there. It's a competition mentality that is too extreme and at times is way too prevalent today. It seems like they're not getting into the competition mentality which is what we need to do.
That's a fair point. I think competition inspires people, and that's a decent way to go about it. Benjarvus Green-Ellis faced off against the amount of competition he did. He never fumbled the football!
I agree!  I wish I played QB, although I know it's a completely different game than it was when I played.
It's good that competition inspires innovation. ESPN even won an Emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line.
It is part of a fluid game and a good example of effort on the part of the people who want to be part of it. I think the problem with officiating is that there is human error. It is a fluid, and it is human effort.
Human error is always going to be human error. Speaking of which, are you interested in politics?
I am, but it makes it so much more difficult to get stuff under the radar in order to have peace and tranquility.  I think I have to keep on my radar in ordered all day to keep up on this stuff.
It's funny how we can find humor in it though.  I mean the president of Indonesia released 3 pop albums in office.
I know, that is hilarious, makes you wonder if that is a motivation for him or just a way to get people to like him. I wonder if it has any motivation at all.
I have no clue, but I'm sure the motivation is not money, did you know that trump is not one of the wealthiest US presidents.  How does he have so much money?
That's interesting. I agree, and I think it's interesting that he was put there because of the difference that people see in the way they support Trump and others. He is a businessman and not a politician.
I think presidents have to separate themselves and place their personal beliefs in office and not separate them from the office. Roosevelt banned Christmas trees because he was a conservationist. I wonder why?
Well to a degree, it is his way to express those thoughts on things, but I think we should let him express those thought.
To be fair, they have to pay for their diligence to important things.  It took the White House 3 days to realize bullets had hit the White house in 2011.
That is pretty unbelievable, especially considering how many jobs are required to be paid, and how much time is required to get them. There is a general decline in society, and the general decline is going unchecked. Everyday we see it all the time, but it is going unnoticed.
True.    But even back then, we did have a socially responsible at times.  George W. Bush put solar panels on the White House.  That was back in the 90s and he was socially responsible.
That's a good gesture, though the actual benefit is very debatable. I wonder if it was for the actual use or for the "good gesture".
I wonder if it gave him more credability than President Banana of Zimbabwe.  He lost credibility.
I heard about that, but I give him props for not changing his name.
I on the other hand props to the election system for improving over time.  The runner up used to be the vice president, but it stuck because the election System for improving.  I'm not sure how that would work today because the runner up would become vice president.
Nope, it doesn't work at all! It shows there are changes in the system that benefit us all. We should make adjustments but I think we have to make adjustments to the system to make it work.
Absolutely, and hopefully it will continue to improve in the future. Well, it's been nice chatting with you. I am looking forward to seeing you forward.
Nice chatting with you too!
Same here, take care!
Hi, how are you?
I am good, how are you?  I am sad about the Superbowl this year.  What do you think of football?
I did watch it but it was pretty slow. I heard the whole end of the game was pretty exciting when the Patriots won but after that it was just pretty slow, I didn't watch much.
I didn't either. I think the first installment was a tediously slow battle of the will to battle, a high scoring shoot-out. The second installment was more similar to Canadian football, a fast-paced style of defensive football similar to the US. The third installment was probably a tedious slow battle, similar to American football.
Yes I can see that, in contrast to the drubbing that Cumberland got in the last year's superbowl.
I think the teams needed to do something to perform better offensively.  Or maybe both teams needed a fight song.  I think my son's school has a fight music written by Snoop Dog and the Fight Song.  Maybe they should do a somthing similar to that or something similar.
I like that Snoop is going to run for office. He's got some talent and should run for president.
I bet he could, I know rap is everywhere these days.  I wonder if he has a net worth, I think he has, the highest paid employees in the department of defense are football coaches and they all have a networth of $1,000,000.  Did you know that?
The coaches command high salaries.  It's not like scientists and engineers don't get money, but sports brings in the money.  The spectacle of the age of the coaches brings in more money.
Yup. And yeah, the high school football game in Texas is a spectacle for the fans. There is a high school game worth over $60 million because the stadium has trained a capacity of 18,000 children, and the stadium can seat only 11,000. Yeah. In Allen Texas, a high School football game is worth $100 million because of the children.
I have not, but I have been to some Texas towns where high school football is the entertainment for the parents and community members, rather than the players. The students, parents, and community member see it as an education rather than a way for the students to get their high school education.
The spectacle continues, though.  American colleges have some of the largest stadiums in the world for the high schoolers.  They have four of the five largest stadiums for the High schoolers in the US.
I think the schools want money, and alumni want winning teams. Funny that bowlers used to make more money than football players back in the 60s, but now bowlers make more than football.
Bizarre.  I live in a town with a college football game every other day and I can't believe that!  I've gotta go see that game.  We've got a stadium full of screaming, screaming country flags flying all over the town.  That's the biggest and most love love in the whole country!  American flag monster!  That is a lot of flags flying in a game!
I enjoy football but not presidential politics. I think people should devote more time to it and get a degree in it. I am not into presidential politics so I do not enjoy football.
Maybe.  John Wilkes Booth would like to think that there is humility in politics, but the presidential wanna-bes, invading the early primary and caucus states, will fill up stadiums and take over.  I am not sure if I believe in humility in Politics.  They are invading all of the early Primary and Caucus states.
That's interesting, and I think that the next election is bound to cause some confusion, I wonder if the Dems will finally pick someone, or if the Democrats will just keep trying to get someone else. The next election will be interesting, it will take a few months, but the election is Bound to be interesting. I wonder how much security they have in the White House still usues floppy disks, I heard that the White house still uses them. I don't know how they still use floppy disks and have to use security to get them out of there.
I think that is because they have to have fancy encryption technology to be able to translate them back to english.  Only one president has ever been able to speak a foreign language fluently, FDR.  I wonder how many can translate themBack to English?
Well, I enjoyed chatting wtih you!
I enjoyed texting as well! I hope that the next presidential election will be clean as it will be a clean one. The victor of the 2016 presidential election had to turn in a majority majority of the popular vote to send a strong message to Washington, makes me want to send you a message to them to turn it around!
Yes, we will see.
Good afternoon, I hope you are well.  Are you interested in politics?
I am, I know a lot about it, mostly about Trump and the president.
I think the power a president has depends on the country.  That is interesting.  I tend to assume that it's because of the republican form of government in our country.
Yes, parliamentary republics are very different.  They are largely ceremonial.
I would assume both parties were represented in those things, but I would assume they were more balanced if the runner up became vice president. I assume both Democrats and Republicans would have to be the runner ups for president.
I guess we are lucky to not have an authoritarian regime or dictatorship,
Venezuela is a terrible example of that.  The president of Indonesia has turned out to be really good though - he has done so much to keep people in office and I love how the president ofIndonesia has turned all the pop alums into "pop alums" which is good.
Maybe they are not called banana like the first president of Zimbabwe was called banana.
I hope that is just a nickname or an affection, I hope we don't call him that to his face like our POTUS does, I think they call him by his face when he is in affection,
I think so. Do you know anything about the white house?
No, I have not been there.  But I heard that the president's guest house is bigger than the white house.  I wonder why?  Did you know the president guest house  is bigger?
I have not either. Did you know there are twins in Ireland and France?
I wonder if they lived in the same city as the first president to live in the US. John Adams was the first President to live there.
That's a great question! Did you know that Roosevelt banned Christmas trees at the white house?
I wonder if he would have approved of cutting down trees.  I think the environmental issues that he did start during his time in office were with the national parks.  He was against the use of national parks and probably approved of cut down trees during his own time in the office.
I think he did, too.  Bush had those solar panels installed.
Yep, added a modern touch. I dint know that. Speaking of the white house sill, did you know that they still use floppy disks to store some part of the data. I can't believe that they can't read it. They still use hard drive floppy disks that can read hard drives in the white House sill.
I didn't know that either.  I wonder if they have pictures of aliens in there?  LOL  I also wonder if bullets hit the white house when some bullets hit it,  or if there are pictures of Aliens?
That is scary, and interesting that the building of the White House is still in use, it's interesting that there was a president who did not have advisers during the term, and the White house is still a building, I wonder what he or she did.
Yes, and it took the secret service 4 days to realize the bullets had gone through.
4 days? That is strange, I wonder why they found it so strange. I'm always shocked at how much money is spent on political races. I bet JFK, Washington and Jefferson were among the most wealthy presidents, I bet they were shocked at all that money is spend on political games.
Great questions.  Well, it was nice talking with you, thank you for all the great questions.
You too, I learned a lot today about government.
Same here, have a good one!
You too! Thanks! :)
Thanks!  Have a good one!
do you like football? I do!
Yes, I do. Do you play fantasy football?
I dont know how that would work out for me, how do you make money at it?
Yes you do make money.  I think it is to create interest in players on teams and to root for them.  Do you like Lamar Jackson?
I guess he is good, I wonder why they don't like him, I guess that is the way players get to be good,
No not really, but I like a lot of the players like Baker Mayfield of the Browns, I'm not an expert but I know a lot about him,
Baker Mayfield is a good QB.   Do you play video games?
Baker Mayfield is good, I think. I do not follow the real NFL or his video game habits.
I dont really, I usually watch the playoffs, but I dont like to follow much more, I try to watch the super bowl, what do you do?
The super bowl is always held on the first Sunday in February, right?
I was unable to watch it this year. busy. but I heard the game will be exciting this year..
I think it had less interest with the champions of the NFC and AFC playing.
I guess I would root for the underdog, but I would be upset if I had to be the underdog. Who would you root for in a game? I would bet on the underdog in every game.
I am not allowed to gamble, but I work for the company that makes tracking chips in shoulder pads so I do.  Do you know what company that is?
lol, thats great.  I dont think they use the tracking chips on the field to make sure they dont use them to track players off the field,  but I think they do use them at restaurants as cheerleaders!  lol
I guess you could, I don't think players can wear shoulder pads to restaurants so I wonder why Matt Patricia, the coach is a rocket scientist, I guess he can be a rocket Scientist and he can wear a helmet like the players.
Maybe they can get Matt to keep track of the eating habits of the guys without those shoulder pads, chips, and chips, it would probably work! I don't know how Matt would be able to keep Track of everyone's eating habits, though.
That is true, but that's a big change. Did you know that the first NFL playoff game was in 1932?
The NFL is a long way from that.  The teams are bigger, the players make more, and the players get a lot of injuries.  I think the teams are big enough that there are a lot more players.  Great chat!
I read that there are 32 teams in the NFL, not just the 32 teams that are in the US.
I'm going to do that too!  Thanks, thanks for all you talk to me about it, I really enjoy it.
No problem, and RPI is such a cool university, I will go there now.
Hi, how are you today?
I'm good, thanks.  I was wondering if you were a football fan?  I know that a lot of people are sad the season is over, but Fantasy football is a hit.  Are you fantasy football fan at all?  It seems like a lot Of people areSad the season has come to a hit
I like football. I don't get much chance to watch it. I try to catch up on football when I can.
Do you do fantasy football? I like the picks and people plan for weeks.
It is the Super Bowl.  I played fantasy sports and the goal is to win the Super bowl, I made that clear.
The goal is to draft a "team by picking members of your teams to make the best team.  Duh!  I've made it to the SB before.  I made it in bowlers before and I like it.  Do you like NFL players?
Bowlers were in a golden age. The modern gladiators showed up. There were many leagues and lots of local interest. They stole the show.
Are you a football fan?  Are you in the league?  I am a football player.  I can't believe that former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never had a fumble in his whole career and he was the only QB to never bowl in the SB.  He was a former Patriots rb Benjarveus Green -Ellis.  Did you know he never had any fumble in a career?
I hope he got a bonus for that! or special gloves! he must have giant hands!
It's hard to say, but he had raw talent.  I think he did.  There are 32 teams in the NFL so there's a total of 32 teams so I think a bonus would be possible.
I follow it more during the playoffs.  I think it would be interesting to see if a woman could play in the playoffs!
Yes, I think so too. The NFL has no rules against women playing as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements.
i would go figure that a woman would be able to be an akicker. i wonder if there are referees that are not akicker?
Man v woman contact would be different, I think.
I think it would make the viewers squeamish. Women on women on women? That would not be fun.
I think I would watch it but I don't think I could watch it for the average game, which only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
That is short,  I guess they stand around waiting a lot.  Great work though,  great work!
Yeah, no kidding.  I wonder if the average lifetime salary of engineers is higher than the average Lifetime earning of an NFL player.  The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is $80,000, while the average career salary of anNFL player is $123,000.
I wonder if it is because of fewer concussions or because there are more women in the engineering. I know women have more than men in engineering.
Yeah. No kidding. The Saints don't want their cheerleaders to have to leave a restaurant if a team player comes in. I wonder if it's because they're cheerleaders or if they have to be out for the whole game? Yeah, the cheerleaders have to get out of the restaurant if the team player is there.
That is sexism, plain and simple. It was great chatting with you!
Great chatting with you too!
Thanks!  You too!
Take care!  Thanks!
Hi there, are you a football fan?
Hi, a little bit. How about you?
I do! I find it curious that the Iowa states visiting locker room is painted pink. I wonder why?
I wonder if that is to intimidate the other team?
Probably just to make me mad and focused on them.
That's the opposite of the football game score of 222-0.
No, I didn't. That is ridiculous for a game. I wonder if there was a mercy rule.
It was Georgia Tech v Cumberland.
Wow. I didn't hear about the game. Was it recent or did it have been a recent one?
Yes it was back in the day.  ESPN won an Emmy for it, for the superimposed line.
Haha, yeah, I love that line! I think it helps viewers see what's going on. There was one RB that never fumbled the ball his entire career. Yeah, and he never fumbling the ball!
Really? Who was it?
The patriot Benjarvus Green-Ellis
Wow I didn't know that. I hear the NFL finally drafted a woman, there was no rule against it.
I did not hear about that, I wonder how many they have drafted?
I bet you can find her.  I will google her. I bet you she has chips on her uniform that tell you where the google is to find her
Maybe that is the purpose of it. The WNBA is actually trying to create a women's league, maybe they will use it for discrimination.
The game generally only has 11 minutes of live play, so I think it would be watched for only 7 minutes, and the game generally does not go on for that many minutes of Live play!
It would probably be crazy and hard to do. I wonder if any of the teams would be my favorite. Who are your favorite teams?
I like the New Orleans Saints, how bout you?
I like the team, I heard there is a rule about the cheerleaders and their employee fraternization, I am assuming it is with the cheerleader's from the rule, is that a rule?
I do not know that rule.  It was great chatting with you!
Are you a football fan?
I used to watch nfl sunday all the time, not so much anymore but I do watch nFl Sunday all the other time.
I used to watch every sunday! It is my favorite time of the year. Do you know what quarterback's average passing is?
No, I didn't know that.  That's impressive!  I find it very interesting that the average NFL game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay. That's not enough for fun to watch.
The league prefers offense over defense nowaday.
Yes, fans want action and I think that's why. It's so annoying to me watching defensive play after defensive play, watching defensive for all this time. My fantasy team is all about defense, they are the point grabbers and if they can win with defense they win all the time.
Did you know that a university football locker room was painted all of pink?
That would be great for the visiting team! I wonder what a mess they would mess up if they did that.  Do you play fantasy football?
Hahaha!  Yeah, I play occasionally.  How about you?
I love playing fantasy hockey!  I never knew that ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line for the yellow line that's used on the lines.
Did you know there are people fantasy draft the national spelling bee?  I wonder how many people fantasy Draft the national bee?
I bet they have it in Vegas, if it existed, I'd be going there!
Yes, you can.  A single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving fantasy and reality.
That's so interesting.  I did not know that.  Another interesting fact - Saints' cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player.  Why?
Hahah, that seems like a distraction...
I guess it's written into their contract.
Football players can have troubles if they do not play well, I wonder if football players will ever have troubles
That is true, it is time for a change.
Money talks.  It seems like everything goes for them.  I know that's what it always seems to be.
Absolutely.  Do you know why?
Nice chatting with you!  Have a happy holiday!
Happy holidays!  Thanks!
Bye. :) :) :)
Hi, how are you?
Hi! Do you like to play fantasy football?
No, I do not. Do you?
I know some about his struggles and fantasy football players are making their choices, do you like Garoppolo the quarterback?
I don't watch much football, but I am a huge fan of football. I think it's insane that the highest score in a football game occurred in 1916 and it was cumberland 222-0.  The tech tech defeated the georgia georgian football team and cumberLAND 222-1.
I like football but I don't play fantasy football like some people do, apparently there is a fantasy drafting the national spelling bee, people are even fantasy drafting it!
That is cool.  I didnt know that.
As part of fantasy congress, players can draft members of congress and bet on legislature's success.
I think that is too bad! I would definetly like to be part of it.
I hear that the lifetime average earnings of an engineer is higher than the lifetime earnings of the average MLB or NFL player.  Sounds like a good occupation to be in, since the average mlb or NFL earnings are less.
Yes I believe it.  It's not easy, it requires a lot of education.  I'm pretty sure it's not for everyone.
Yes, I studied it for four years and changed majors, it is very difficult to know what type of material to study, what to do, what you should studied.
I meant to say that I didn't like it.
If you ever visit the University of Iowa, you might want to visit the pink locker room!
Yep, I read that the last time I did.  That would be interesting to see for myself.
I hear that bowlers used to get paid so much more than football stars.  I hear at one time that they made more than top football stars and were paid more.
Yep. and a janitor from chicago wrote a fantasy manuscript with over 400 watercolor illustrations called "The Last 20 years."  Fascinating, unreal, in all realms of life and death.. and in the fantasy manuscript, a janitors death.  fascinating.
Wow, I wonder if fantasy is still prominent in the UK.
New orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant, the cheerleaders Are required to leave.
I think so.  The NFL has that rule because a woman will make more than a man and that sounds sexist.  I wonder what the rule is about.
I think so, they have no rule against it.
Well I got to go, nice talking with you.  Who were you rooting for in the Superbowl?
Good morning.  Do you follow the NFL at all?
I do. Did you play a fantasy football game?
I love playing fantasy football! I played for bout 3 or 4 years now.  I used to play in a fantasy league for congress, they have a fantasy football league for Congress.
I dont know a bit about players QB Macus Mariona is one of the worst QBs of the season, not a bad choice, but not one of my worst QB's
I agree. I kind of thought they should have drafted him, but I kindOf thought he was overrated when they drafted him.
Yeah, I think his passes were a little low because of his season the previous year, I know he had 50 passes in one season and 50 the year before.
Saquon Barkley seems like a good pick for my fantasy draft next season.
I was not aware that he was a player that I could play. What position did he play?
He is a running back for the New York Giants
I love fantasy leagues, I love fantasy football. People are into all sports so it's a great choice for many people.
I had no idea there is a fantasy draft for the national spelling bee but I wonder how that works. Do you know how that Works?
I have no idea either, I would like to try that, it does sound kind of boring though, I like the idea of the fantasy congress league, that does sound interesting
I heard about that league, players draftmembers of congress and points are based off legislative success. I wonder how many points are given in the league? It sounds like a snoozefest if you ask me.
Sounds like it would be boring, but interesting if it is fantasy or not. Do you like fantasy?
I do lol.  I like the old ones.  How about you?
I do like them an interesting fact is that a janitor wrote 16,000 pages of fantasy, but never published his work, that janitor was 15
That's a lot of writing.  I wonder if he ever got published?  I don't know if putting that much work out there and not getting a book deal means he didn't do a lot, maybe he was just putting it out there back in the days before the internet and not putting it all out there to get published.  Do you think he got a bookdeal or what?
I think he didnt because he was waiting to finish it and then died.  Its hard to believe a book had potential and then just died. I wonder how a piece of literature got discovered after he died, maybe it is hard to know how a book could get discovered after someone died, but the book had possible value.
I agree. A single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy.
That is interesting I didnt know that, the brain is really full with mysteries!
I agree. It's been fun chatting!
Yeah, it's been great chatting with you too!
Hello, do you like to watch football?
I do from time to time. How about you?
I am a University of Iowa football fan, they paint their visitors locker room pink.
That is cool.  Do you watch the NFL at all?
I love watching the NFL and all 32 teams. I like the Vikings because they are my favorite of the 32 teams!
I like the Cardinals! Do you like them?
Nice.  I was never a fan back in the day, but I loved Jerry Rice and Steve Young when they were playing.  Was a fan of his.  Love playing with them, I loved the old games.  Did you know the gametime is only 11 minutes of actual actual games?
I do not follow the odds, but if I see a team winning I try to follow the Odds.
I don't, do you?
They are betting on a team, part of it is how the team is handled.  The team winning is the most likely.
Gotcha.  I see that some teams have low odds of winning, but I think Benjarvus Green Ellis and some of the picks of other teams have high odds of win.  That could change if some of those picks go under though.
Yes that is correct I think you're right about the teams winning not being one or the other, I think the Vikings are one of the teams won't be and he was a running back, I did not know he was from the Vikings
Nope lol, Benjarvus used to fumble the ball. We need to come back and teach our teams how to not fumble the football
lol, he should pick it up and get the Vikings play the Packers!
I think the Packers are the worst, but the vikings are also the worst of all teams lol, I don't know how you can beat a team that much, but you don't beat them 222-0 like Georgia Tech beat them222-0!
No doubt! I would never bet against Rogers, and I bet against Rodgers! But, I think the Vikings are favored, and the packers are favored too.
True, it's pretty prime time for a fantasy football team to have a quarterback.  I would bet on the QB.  If you have a fantasy fantasy footballteam, who is your quarterback?
LOL  I can't either. One of the most expensive high school football stadiums was built in Allen, TX.  I wonder why?
I did see that in the article, I think I read it in the news, that seems like such a waste of money in my opinion, what is your opinion?
It was $3 million! That's a ton of money. I know Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's football team.
Wow. I did not know that! I did hear about the money though. I will have to check it out later, I wonder if Snoop has it? Have an amazing day friend!
Are you a big NFL fan?
Yes I like watching football. I like the games even though there's only an average of 11 minutes of live game play in a game. I don't think I've ever seen more than 11 minutes in any one game.
that is crazy, I heard that most of that time is spent moving the chains, player, coaches, etc. I guess they need to do that for the players, but I guess it's not much time spent moving it for the coaches.
Yeah, the technology for marking the first down line is pretty amazing, ESPN won an emmy for creating the yellow line, that line is really useful.
Interesting, I guess they must have a lot of TV viewers?
Yeah, technology is huge in football.  The nfl uses tracking chips in sholder pads, which record every player movement on the field, and also tracking chips on the tracking chips  in sh Holder pads to record player movement
Yeah, they are tracking a lot more than just hitting and the trackers.  They have them in helmets too, too.
I wonder if they have the engineer who designed the tracking chips. The average engineer makes more over their lifetime than the average NFL player. The engineer who designs them makes more than the typical average nfl player.
Wow, I would have never guessed that!
Yeah, me either. Did you know that asthe top bowlers made more in the 60s than asthe Top football stars? That's crazy.
That is crazy,  I guess the dream job for a pro bowler was not to be a pro bowler?  lol
I know, right? It's crazy! I can't imagine being in the fantasy leagues for pro bowling. I wonder if they have fantasy leagues in the spelling bee. They have fantasy drafts for the national spelling bee and there are fantasy leagues  for the fantasy drafts in the US.
That's pretty unbelievable.  Funny, there was a fantasy comic in which he was knighted.  I guess he was a knighted!
That's awesome. I think that guy deserves to be knighted. He was a janitor from Chicago who wrote a 15,145 page fantasy manuscript over the course of 15 years. The guy deserves it.
Wow yeah that is one guy.  The Lord of the Rings fantasy.  Did you ever get into that?
I have a list to read and watch it and will read it soon, but I also enjoy the Harry Potter fantasies. I have that on my list to Read and watch too.
I have read half of them, but I have not read the Tolkien fantasy.  I do like the Tolkien Fantasy.
Cool.  Did you know that a single fold in the brain makes the difference in our perceptions of reality and fantasy?  I know that it is a tight fold but a single tight fold in my brain makesTheres something so crazy about that.  Tolkien is one of the best, I think.
Yeah that is a crazy idea.
he could write a fantasy novel based on oral traditions that is based on modern media.
I think the modern media is pretty gross, the old time stuff is the best. the traditions are the best, and modern media, not so much.
I agree. Have a great night!
Do you watch the NFL?
I don't watch the NFL very much, but I do watch the super bowl. You?
I watched, thought it was boring this year.  ESPN won an emmy for it, I think.  I'm sure the market was not what I thought.
Wow that's crazy! I guess I will give it a try haha, I wonder if it's worth it, did you know the Patriots had a running back who never once fumbled the ball every time he was on the Patriots, I guess he was a RB, I would give him an A haha
Yeah that would be hilarious. Did you know that a full game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay? I wonder how they do it. I know there is only 11 minutes in a fullGame.
That doesn't surprise me haha, the highest scoring football game was the super bowl and it was the highest in a while! Kind of a really boring game though, the Super Bowl was even boring this year, which doesn't surprises me since it was only the 5th highest scoringFootball game ever
That is crazy!  Did you know the NFL uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads?
I am scared. There are a lot of great stats that the ball does not rotation and the rotation of the ball, I hope there are actually actual citizens in the game that can put together a lot  of great Stats and I really hope they are not scared.
Yeah, I know.  I think there are other teams in the NFL collecting them too, to optimize plays.  What about the NFL?  What do they do with them?
Honestly, I'm not really sure honestly. What are your thoughts on the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders being forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player?
Well, a lot of teams do that (like the Redskins, and the Redskins) and cheerleaders can't fraternize with the players.
That seems outdated. I guess the whole reason they need to be friends is to keep engineers from becoming engineers. I wonder why that is.
Yeah I have a bunch of friends, but I think on average we make up for no one but a football player.
Yep it's awesome!  I've never heard that in my lifetime.  And yep, the NFL has no rule against female players!  They have been trying since 2001.  I don't think there has been any rule against them though.
I heard about it but I'm not sure how many Americans can stomach the idea of a woman getting injured in the field. I can't see a womanGetting injured on the field...
Good point. I thought that was interesting that the NFL game only lasts 11 minutes which is super low, but I thought it was 11 minutes and 17 seconds.
Yeah, that makes sense. I love the game but the clock watching gets annoying, especially standing around and watching. I like standing around but theClock watching gets frustrating.
Yep I agree. Do you watch any Fantasy movies? Do you like fantasy football? I do fantasy movies but I don't do fantasy football
I used to play fantasy football but I don't any time now, to be honest.  I've been doing it much longer.
I've played fantasy football, I don't like it because it's stupid haha. I did hear there is a fantasy congress, and there is also fantasy national spelling bee! Did you hear about the fantasy national dictionary?
I think that's weird. I wonder how they rate the players ahead of time. Nice chatting with you!
hi, do you like football?
I do like it. Do you watch it?
I have a passing knowledge of the sport, but I am not familiar with it.
I know the basics. It's crazy how little there are actually minutes of active game play. I can't believe how long the games last and how long they are.
I agree. It's really interesting that there is no rule against female players. I wonder if the eligibility requirements inherently disqualify them?
I would think if they were eligible to play they would make it, but I can't imagine many women would want to play.  They wont be as good as the 300+ pound linemen.  There are many of them.
I think that football is a dangerous sport. I think they have developed a sport for women comparatively but not for everyone.
I agree, I think they hit it so hard that they used chips in shoulderpads to record moves of players and now they use chips in shoulders to record move to record the moves of the players after being hit
I heard they also put chips in the footballs to try to gather data on velocity, rotation, speed, speed of the ball, location, and they even put chips into the football itself to gatherData
yeah, I wonder how they know that, I think the data is used to determine reviews, like if a ball was in the air and wasnt there at a certain point, and how they get that data?
I think that the data is effective real time.
ESPN won an Emmy for the yellow line and the line sure helped things develop in terms of home viewership.
True, it made things more digestible to a general audience and promoted its popularity.
Did you know the game with the highest scoring and biggest spread was the game that had the highestscoring and biggest Spread in 1916?
I did, imagine that, I think there are hundreds of them now!
I dont know but 222-0 is not bad, I wonder what the other team did, I dont think they were that bad
I think that was a combination of a winning team and a bad one.  I don't know if it was a good one or a losing team.
Ive never seen it before, but that would be quite a blow out for sure!
Do you play fantasy football?
No, my brother does, but I have never. Do you?
I recommend it. In any case, thank you for chatting.
Hi! I never knew the NFL was the highest professional level of football in the world!
Yes, it is.  My favorite sports season is the 16 week regular season.  Do you have a favorite sportsSeason?
I usually only watch the playoffs.
I do, but I don't have a favorite team.  My favorite team is the Ravens, and I usually like the division winners from my conference that advance to the playoffs.
Interesting. I understand that computer chips are used in the ball to help track movements of players, it is quite high tech.
I never knew about that, and the ball? I think players can see it in the shoulder pads, but I don't think they can see the ball.
Did you know that women allowed to play in the US in the 60's?
Yes, if they met the league's eligibility requirements.
I wonder what the requirements are. I watched a super bowl once and it wasn't very good.
The playoffs are the best show. I think they really put emphasis on the game since it's the first Sunday in February and the emphasis is on the playoffs.
True! I thought it was the commercials and half time performances. They play too many commercials andHalf time is too much commercials and Half time is not enough, I think.
It does, alot of times the playoff games are between the champions of the NFC and AFC, and that is where we got the names of the champions.
Do you know when the playoffs start?
It's this weekend, I plan on Sunday, my favorite team is the raven, so who is your favorite team?
I wonder if they will play in one of the conferences that they are in?
They are in the AFC and play the Chargers this weekend. They came into town hyping the game up, players, cheerleaders and on the other hand are in town hyped up to play the Chargers this weekend as well.
I wonder why they have those rules?
Yes, the saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as the players and they can't even eat in same restaurant with the players
I guess they get such bad press about teams not doing that. They could be distracted from the players.
Yes I think so. In one restaurant the cheerleader has to leave if a player walks in, but in another restaurant the player walks into it.
That is pretty strict! I wonder why that is.
Hi, do you remember JJ Watt called Andy Dalton the best QB in the history of afc north.  He was the worst quarterback with an arm, the red BB gun!  I remember Jj Watt called Andrew Dalton the "red BB gun" of afcp north.
He is the worst quarterback in the football? I think that is the best quarterback?
I'm biased but I must admit I don't know the playoffs so the team in my division, the Baltimore Ravens rookie QB Lamar Jackson is the best team I think, I'm biased I don not really know the whole playoffs.
Cool I remember seeing him in Cleveland brows play.
Good.  Cleveland has not made the playoffs in 6 weeks.  Baker Mayfield has not started in one this season and they named him the QB after the QB that started for them in 2016, but he has not been good.
I heard that too. The Iowa universities looker room is painted pink for the visiting team.
That is pretty interesting.  It must make them really angry at the opposite team,  or maybe they knock their heads off and make them more angry on the field lol The defense and pass rushers on the opposite side.
I feel you on that one.  Did you know that in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as NFL players?
Wow!  That's mind blowing!  I wonder how much the top earners in the NFL make today?  Crazy.  People even do fantasy fantasy for the National spelling bee which is crazy!
Yeah, that is crazy.  There is even a fantasy congress!  I don't know what that is about, but I don' t think I would want to be in it.
Sounds so boring in comparison to fantasy sports, players draft members of congress and base the points off legislative success, I wonder how they gauge that, seems like a really boring way to gauge that.
lol  Did you know that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy.  That is why a single folding of the brain Makes the difference in the difference Between perceiving Reality and Fantasy!
haha crazy but true.. did you know that a female player could be allowed to play for the NFL if they meet the eligibility requirements?  It would not surprise me if a female could beallowed to play as long as they are in the NFL.  haha crazy
Yeah I heard about it and I'm not surprised, personally I think the league will be like the NBA, not sure I personally want to see it, but yeah I heard that.
That would be pretty cool. Sounds like throwback to the old Jim Crow laws. I enjoy watching the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders though, they are actually allowed to play in the NFL lol. That's pretty cool considering they can play if they need to like an NFL player.
LOL, I think we should start with the sexist ones first and start with those!  On a lighter note, did you hear about the old janitor that wrote everyday for 20 years?  He was a janitor who wrote over 15,000 pages.  I wonder if he was sexist or something?  lol
Yeah, that is impressive.  I wonder how much of his works are still alive.  He created so much, his family received the proceeds of every work discovered.
Maybe they did the right thing. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy award for one?
Yeah I figured since they are a world wide leader in sports they would have been the one creating the "yellow" marker superimposed on the televisions with the first down marker. I had no idea, but yeah I figured they are the world wide lead in sports.  I think they are creating the yellow line to mean that the television is on at certain times.  lol
I agree my friend.  The NFL merged with the American football league (AAF) when it formed in 1932.
I bet it was one of the greatest and most profitable mergers of all time. I never imagined the game would expand to have 32 teams. I bet it's one of those "never imagined the games would have that many teams, that's for sure."
Yeah humble beginnings.  He never fumbled the ball in his career.
That's not too shabby! I remember watching Green-Ellis play. Well, I enjoyed talking with you. I learned new and old things.
Hi there, do you watch football?
I do. The NFL has 32 teams and I like the one team that has the most place. I think it's the only time I really like it. What about you?
Do you have a favorite?
Not really. What do you think about the NFL rule about females?
I can't believe it?  There are so many rules towards females, I don't know if they will ever allow it!
They don't have a rule against females playing as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements, but I don't think they have a particular rule against Females playing
Nice, I think that's kind of sexist. I heard the Saints have a rule against having female cheerleaders, I wonder what that rule is, I heard they have female cheerleader?
Yes, I know what you're talking about. They have a rule where cheerleaders are forbidden to eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player.
Yea that is weird,  I don't understand why that is,  any opinions or thoughts?
I don't either.  I think it was made up,  I mean,  a cheerleader and a player are married,  and the cheerleader has to go to the player.
Boom!  Mind blown! lol  I wonder why they had such a rule back in the day.  I hope they didn't have that rule back then lol
Maybe it was.  An engineer has an average lifetime earnings that of an NFL player.  But the average lifetime Earnings of an engineer is much more than the average Lifetime earnings of an nfl player.
That's crazy but it's believable, NFL careers tend to be short so it's not crazy that they deserve more money, engineers make chips to track all that data and they make chips, so they deserve it more than that.
Yes, I wonder what the data chips will do for the NFL and what they will use the data for.
Wow, they really do keep track of everything.
I know they have tracking chips in the players shoulder pads and also in the footballs, and also the football itself.
Yes. They track like velocity, rotation, and move. They can also track likeVelocity, rotation.
Yes, and they make such a detailed game plans.
I agree! Have you ever heard of Benjarvus Green Ellis?
No, that rings a bell, but I do not know him. Is he a patriot?
Yep, he was from Bengal.  He never fumbled once in his career.
Wow, that's quite the accomplishment.  What position did he play?  I wonder what position he was able to play.
Running back, he had a lot of carries, amazing how he did that. Nice chatting with you!
Do you like the NFL?
Yea I try to follow it almost everyday, it was interesting how Todd Gurley signed a $32 million extension with the rams and he ended up injured, I don't know how that was possible, it's interesting how todd gurley signed that $32 Million extension and then ended up injuring himself
Gurley was going to get the largest guarantee of any position for a RB and he did not get it
Yea, I wonder how much that influenced Le'von Bell to not sign with the Steelers
Bell has a long few seasons left in him, I guess the lifespan for running backs is only 6-8 seasons.  They offered him a one year deal but I wonder how long it would last.  He has to get a new deal soon.
I heard Bell wanted $15 million a season for the next 5 years and then $32 million after that.
I think quarterbacks have a longer lifespan when they reach 30 so they start to decline in skill and I think in the NFL they have to reach 55 before they start.  I wonder if quarterbacks have to have a much longer lifespan.
I think Alex Smith has a lot of years left, especially without injury.
It's amazing that in the first 11 minutes of gameplay, so many injuries occur, and it's only for 11 minutes!
Yea, I bet the injuries are a major reason why engineers make more over the lifetime on average than NFL players and that is a major reasons why engineers makes more on average
Did you know that there is no rule preventing them from women playing in the NFL?  There is no rules against women playing
Yea, I could see a woman played as a place kicker one day, or even playing at place kicker at all
I could see that happening. I don't mind the pink visitor lockers at the University of Iowa. Have you heard of them?
I wonder if she'd be made a better football QB than female bowlers who have made twice as much as top football stars?
Probably not.  Television probably ruined them.  The yellow first down line created by ESPN for the game became easier to understand and I think deserved the Emmy for the yellow first downs line.
Yea I'm surprised that the yellow first down line wasn't used sooner than ESPN did, I thought it would be on the line sooner than that, and yea I'm also surprised they didn't do that sooner than espn did
True.  I think it paved the way for the idea to embed chips in the footballs and shoulder pads for record data.  Do you do fantasy football?  It's a new idea.
Yea but fantasy events are getting out of hand, like the spelling bee, they have a fantasy draft for that, I don't know if you do that but there is a fantasy drafts for the spelling Bee
I wonder how much it is worth, the spelling bee is used a lot in the congress.
Yea, I'm not a big fan of fantasy congress though, do you?
I don't pay enough attention to it to know what is going on, do you?
do you watch football? I don't really watch much
I love football!  How about you?
Yeah, I watch it on Sundays.
On saturdays!  I like it too!  14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums are for college football teams.
Yeah that is definitely a thing. We have more time on saturdays to watch.
I hear you there.  Do you ever watch it?  I only ever watch some of the high school games.
Nah, I'm not very good at it.  I do like high school football, but I don't know much about it.
Honestly, I think the games are ok, there are teams in my area that have won state championships and a few teams that have even won state Championships, but I don't really know much about it. What about you?
Interesting. What is the name of the actual school?
There is a school in Allen, Texas that spent $60 million dollars to build a football stadium to seat 18,000 people.  It was a school I know of in Texas that's spent $100 million dollars
That's a ton of money.  I wonder if it gets a lot of fans.  Not wholly molly, but still...
I hope they have a lot of rich residents to pay for the stadium, too!
Yeah for sure. The highest scoring game ever was 222-0.
I wonder how many teams were in the game.
Georgia Tech versus Cumberland.
That sounds like something you would see more time recently between some of the college teams.
lol  I'm not sure.  I think it was back in 1916 when they wore helmets.
I guess there were no defenses then.
Yeah.  Cumberland is known for their field, not their QB.  LOL  It was so nice chatting with you!
Georgia tech doesn't sound like they were super good, but the competition was probably super good.  It was nice chatting with you too!
Yeah, that was hilarious.  That debacle was so hilarious. Have a nice day!
Hi, do you like football?
I do.  It's the best thing in so many countries.
Yeah that is true and I like american football too, do you like it?
I do, did you know Iowa painted their visitor locker room pink?
Hmm I wonder if that is supposed to have an effect on the opposing team or just the opposing one.
Yeah I'm not sure.  In the 1960's football players made more money than football players in the US.
Wow, that is interesting.  Do you know the highest score in college football?
Yes that was 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland!
Yeah, that must have been the best game ever. I bet Georgia Tech still brags about it. I wonder how old the game has gotten. I would think it would not have been.
I bet they do, did you know that ESPN won an Emmy in 2010?
Yeah they won for the superimposed yellow line, the one with the yellow line that tells you where the first down line is
Yeah, I am grateful for that and it makes game watching much easier at home.
Agreed. Do you know who Benjarvus green-ellis is?
Yeah he is the one who never fumbled the ball once in his career
Yeah. Did you know that women can play in the NFL?
Yeah as long as they qualify, there is no rule against it, so as long they can qualify
True. Did you know the average game only has 11 minutes of tv in an average game?
Yeah, that is pretty short. we are glued to the tv for hours.
Yes and yet engineers make more over the lifetime than football players.
I guess that makes sense, they have longer careers so they can have longer career over their lifetime.
Good point. Nice chat!
Are you a fan of the NFL?
Hi there! I am familiar with fantasy football but not too familiar with football. I enjoy watching all forms of sports and I enjoy football.
I started playing recently, it's not that much fun surprisingly. I like fantasy baseball better.
It is surprisingly fun!  I like how the number of players play in it is more than in a real game since only a few players play on the field at a time.
I think in baseball it's like most sports.  There are spots for pitching, the game has a number of offensive players, and it makes the game a lot more fun to follow.  It's not like other sports, where there are only spots to pitching.  So it makes a game a much better game.
Correcting myself, I meant fantasy football. Thanks for clarifying. I am more familiar with baseball, it's very entertaining to watch. I saw that Benjarvus Green-Ellis had broken his non-fumble record in the superbowl.
Yeah the Super Bowl this year was pretty much a dud, from fans' perspective, at least for a Super Bowl.  It's been years since I've seen one.
I agree. I think that many people who participated in sports betting would enjoyed this year's game a lot more than this year.
Speaking of football did you know the highest scoring game pro or college is the highest score ever?
I guess it was the seventies and the highest score I can think of is the seventeenth.  Do you have a guess?
I guess in the college game Georgia Tech beat Cumberland, 222-0.
I remember seeing that a long time ago, it was a long, long time before I remember the name of the team.  I can't imagine the news feeds were flooded with jokes and social media discussing it.  Can you imagine being in the NFL and your feeds being flooded with the jokes about it?  I am surprised they are still in the nfl.
Yeah it seems like a long time ago.  It would be cool if a female player would make a team,  I think it would be really cool if one did.  Yeah I'm not sure a female Player would make it in.
Yeah, I would love to see it, I can't imagine it but I would like to see professional linebackers do it.  I would have to be extremely buff to survive a tackle like they do.  Professional linebackers have to get extremely buff.
Yeah, they would probably make it go by so fast, I wonder how that would happen. Do you think the girls were able to happen?
Yeah, it's a big step, and it's not like the Saints treat their cheerleaders well. They're forbidden from eating at the same restaurant as the players.
I read about that, I think that rule is pretty outdated to be honest, that rule seems really silly to be quite honest.
Yeah I agree with you. I wonder who initiated that rule in the first place? I have no clue or theories as to who initiated it.
I don't know. I think it was something about the QB dating the cheerleader from the other team. Random thought.
Yeah, that's a good theory.  The color the University of Iowa's cheerleader locker rooms completely pink is a color the university painted the visitor locker rooms entirely pink.
Yeah, that is pretty funny. I wonder who was in charge that gave the final say on what paint they used.
I'm not sure, probably the head coach of the opposing team's coach made him look that way, but back in the day, they were probably in over their heads when they would do that. I wonder if the opposing Team coach made it over their Heads to the head of the Head Coach
Are you a fan of football?
I do, I like both college and nfl, what about you?
Same here.  I can't believe the highest score was 222-0!
Yeah, it was in 1916 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland that bad?
Yeah, that would have been crazy to see. It would have taken a whole game to get over that.
Yeah. Cumberland even put up a fight.
I guess they did, but they did not do well at all.
Haha well, that didn't make it any less bad. haha.  Maybe they can beat us if they painted their visitor locker room pink like University of Iowa did.  They did it to make it look like they painted the visitor's locker room Pink like University Of Iowa!
I don't know, but that is cheating!
No, I don't think it is cheating, but if it works then I would.
True. Did you know bowlers used to be made more than NFL stars?
That's crazy. That's big time. An engineers lifetime earnings is higher than that of an NFL player, too. I wonder if that means engineers lifetime earning is higher or the NFL player is?
I think players don't play that long or make as much, but they still make it.
Well it's kind of interesting that the average career of an NFL player is only 11 years, so the players have long careers.  I think an average NFL player has about 10 years on an average career.
I wonder how much gameplay is in a game, the one that only lasts 11 minutes.
That is crazy to think, there is only 11 minutes of gameplay, when you consider that it takes hours for a game to last 3 hours
lol I can believe it. To be honest, I can't believe it took me 3 hours just to be honest.
That's true, they should have a rule about that, maybe that'd speed things up. There are no female players, I wonder why there is no rule against that.
Yeah, I saw some female players in high school. Nice chatting with you.
Yes, I remember playing in HS.
Yeah, I was in a high school league too.  I still have some old ones around from my high school.  Have a good evening!
Hope you have a good evening!
Hello!  Do you follow football?
Hello, I don't really. It's not my favorite sport. What about you? What is your favorite sport?
I do, I follow it around the playoffs, do you? Did you hear that the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink?
I think they want to throw off the opponent
I have no idea, I guess I could imagine it not working too well but I would imagine it could.
Yeah, I doubt a color would really affect another team's performance, but it's a tradition.
The highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0. I wonder if that helped cumberlands?
I wonder if they had helped Cumberland that day, that must have been some freak hurricane or something.
Probably not! Did you know that in the 1960s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars?
I wonder if that was because of the offseason jobs for the players? Do you have a favorite team and/or players?
Yes, and they did learn to manage money better. I heard that the average NFL game is very short, only 11 minutes of live gameplay.
It seems like they are always trying to fit in more ads. Do you watch hockey or basketball live? I like to watch hockey but it is usually only on TV.  I don't get to watch basketball live, I think.
True but the ads take up a lot of time in NFL TV games, and ads take a lot in the NFL TV Games
Yes, I like the ads for the Super Bowl but they charge millions of dollars for them, too
True!  I think they do.  The fans, in the stands, can't wait for the game to start!
That is super boring.  The stoppages, the songs, the videos, the presentations, the concerts, the stoppages in the stadium, the video presentations.  It is not very fun.
I can imagine. The NFL is so interesting in that way. I think the NFL should allow women to play in the game. There's no written rule against female players, but I think it would be interesting. There is no written record of a rule against male or female players.
I would be worried that they could get hurt, but I don't think they would get hurt. I would be more worried about the hits they would take from the pound men playing in those positions. They could take major damage.
True, but there is less than 10 minutes of combat in the whole 11 minutes of fighting.
I don't see the chance for major injury just based on the size advantage of a man.  I do see some women breaking barriers, but I don't think there is a chance for a chance at a major injury, despite some belief that they might have a chance.  If they were to accomplish that I can see women breaking through, but man, there is no chance for Major Injury just based off of their size advantage.
True.  Well, I enjoyed chatting with you!
You too! Have a great day!
Hi there, do you like Fantasy?
I do, it is my favorite genre of books. Do you have a favorite genre?
I do.  Do you play any fantasy sports?
No, not really I don't know how that would work.  I don'n know much about fantasy sports to be honest.  Most people pick up their teams from the stats or based on other people's teams.
Yep pretty much the same, I love playing fantasy football, but I also love playing Fantasy National spelling bee as well.
I didn't know that, I'm not knowledgable enough for that, but I'll have to watch for fun. I'm making a "Fantasy Congress" fantasy team, making me the most knowledgsable about all sports!
haha that would be fun to try and play with congress. I wonder if it is really fun, did you know a single fold in the brain is what makes the difference between reality and fantasy?
That is a remarkable thing about the human body.  That fold allowed a humble, janitor to write and/or read such an amazing fantasy masterpiece.  I would love to be that janitor.  He or she could write a amazing fantasy novel about the wonders of the humanBody.  The fold allowed him or her to do the most remarkable thing.
I love reading, but it takes a long time to read lol. Even though a novel is only 224 pages long, I still don't have the time toread it.
True. I would like to publish it. It sounds fascinating to me. In some of those public things, a few hundred pages are illustrations. I wonder if those books are just that or if some of the few hundred page are illustrations?
It does sound really cool to check it out. Do you like football at all?
I live in football country so it's hard to avoid it. I don't have a particular team to root for but I don's mind if there's a game on. It's fun to watch a lot and I don' t have a team to watch, just live in Football country and it's just hard to keep up.
I love football. U of Iowa painted their opposing team's locker room pink.
Sounds like a huge rivalry between the college teams in Iowa thing, they must have a huge, huge rivalry, or maybe just to intimidate the other team, sounds like it could intimidate them.
Did you know the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay.
I suppose it could be longer if there were no huddles and waiting for the snap.  I suppose they could use longer.  ESPN got an award for the creation of the field image, the yellow line, for the first snap.
 ESPN did? I love that yellow line.
Yeah, it makes it easier for the viewers to follow along.  It was such a deserved award, I think.  Take home some well deserved award myself!
The NFL has no written rule against women playing in the league, but there is no written Rule against women play in the NFL.
I don't know about a written rule, but if there are requirements like that, I'm sure there is a pro team that has one.  In New Orleans, there isn't a written Rule against a woman being a cheerleader for a pro pro team, so I wonder how they treated her if she went through the requirements.
Maybe they can be a kicker one day.  It was good chatting with you.  Take care, take care, and have a good one.
Hey how is it going? Did you know the NFL has no rule against female players?
I did. That seems like a smart move. I wonder if there were law suits against it. That would be obvious and easy to pursue.
Yes, iss true. It is not lpossible in my lifetime.
I think so, but that's a stretch.  Maybe a girl, maybe a kicker or punter, who would turn pro as a kicker?  I think it would be a stretch for me, but maybe.
I'm not sure. I never watch the NFL. I don't watch the nfl. There's only 11 mins of actual gameplay apparently.
I do watch the some games. I'm not excited to see a bunch of millionaires play a game, but I'm excited to go watch a bunchof millionaires play.
I don't watch any sports, but I watched the superbowl. Did you hear abou the weird rule the NFL has against saints cheerleads?
I did not, what is the reason for that wierd rule? Is there some hanky panky going on? Or is it just hanky Panky?
I think just to prevent that sort of thing, lol.
Did you know that an engineer makes more than an NFL player?
The NFL player makes a lot more, but that is probably calculated over their lifetime.  He plays until age 55 and then plays until old 55.  I don't think the NFL player's makes a whole lot in his lifetime.
It's funny that the players sholder pads have little chips on them like chips on the playersSholder pads
That's crazy! I am hopeful that they don't make citizens wear them. That way they don's have that information to share and be hopeful that no one uses it!
Do you like fantasy football?
No, I don't do fantasy. I know some people do, like spelling bees.
That is some wierd sports related fact. I know there is a fanatasy league for betting on the super bowl. I have placed a few times, but I am not into betting. I am more into gronk and the super Bowl.
Haha, that is a weird one. I guess people do all that fantasy stuff. I don't really like fantasy politics, but I do like fantasy Politics.
I don't but I do know about it, its my passion. Do you?
I don't care about sports personally haha I don't read as much as I used to. I do like Terry Pratchett though though, do you know who he is?
I have read about Terry Prachett, how about you?
I assume his work is not very good, but apparently he was knighted, so I assume his WORK is good, he writes fantasy comedy?
He did a book.  People who get knighted are real losers.
Haha, I think so!  I know the guy who was a loser was the quarterback Benjarvus Green-Ellis,  he never fumbled a football,  the guy was a winner haha
Are you a football fan?  Do you follow NFL or do you do fantasy football?
I am a Redskins fan! How bout you?
I don't follow football much, but I am a Redskins fan. I'm surprised it hasn't changed much since the playoffs.
I know what you are talking about, they made a decision.  Apparently the Cleveland Browns are pretty bad right now, I wonder if they will be better soon, they have not made a Decision yet.
Browns are a terrible defense, I think they are working on a terrible offense but they paint their locker room walls brown for inspiration.
I know Trent williams is leading the offensive line for the Redskins this season.
I think that I would put money on the skins, but who would I put money against?
I think his running average is terrible, apparently. Can you imagine a women's football team? Can you ever imagine a Women's football game? I don't watch it.
No.  I think they should have a league with women in the NFL.  No skimpy uniforms,  running around in skimpy uniform,  but they can try.
Well, there is no lingerie league. Women can't tackle like men, but they can impact the game.
I suppose it depends.  I would expect that women would be better kickers, punters, and punters.  But I don't think a woman could do the contact of a woman.
I would imagine the women would be using tracking chips like the men to find out how to play but I don't think they would have tracking chips.
It would be interesting to compare men and women on the field.  I think it is funny that there are male cheerleaders that are part of the movement.  It would be funny to see how they compare to the men and woman on the Field.
They have to leave the restaurant if the women do not come in.  I wonder why they have to.
I think that is supposed to prevent romance, not sure if it accomplishes that though.  Do you like the Saints?
I'm sure it does not.  The problems are they get rowdy, and maybe that is why they have had problems.  Have you ever watched the national spelling bee?
I have watched it before, but not lately.
Well apparently people fantasy draft it.
I guess it's a gamble. People will find a way to win or not and then gamble.
I have no idea, I wonder how much a fantasy congress is. I wonder if there is a fantasy Congress.
I wonder how they do that? Great chat though!
Hey, do you do fantasy football? Do you like Barkley?
I do but I play in some circles. He seems to be making a comeback, I think.
He is very good. He had a lot of yards this year. He was the #1 pick in the draft. I think Barclay will probably put up a lot more yards this Year.
He is a junior in the NFL. He comes from Penn State.
Yeah I hope so, that's promising.  He has a lot of possibilities so maybe he can keep his workload to a minimal and they can give him a lot to do and give him the workload he needs, that is a lot,
I am curious to see how much money he will make. Did you know that in the 60's bowlers made more money than nfl players. I think I would like the NFL a lot better.
That is shocking! I thought that would be shocking. Do you know which was the highest scoring football game of all time?
222-0!  That was in the 4th quarter.  There was only 1 left in the first quarter!
I was rooting for Cumberland, I think that was their first loss lol!
I wonder when they will come back and get that magical yellow line?
Nope! I wish they would have helped us because we lost so badly. It's worth giving ESPN an Emmy for creating it. Haha.
I would love to see that!  I would also love to know why the school Iowa paints the visiting team locker room pink.
Haha that is funny!  That is good for the school!  I personally love the Patriots.  I like that they have a good QB.  There is only 1 players that has never fumbled the ball in his school!
He was amazingly good.  I wonder how he did it, considering the NFL only has 11 minutes of live gameplay and the time per game is only 11 minutes at a time per games.
That's not a lot of time, that is shocking.  Did you know that there is no rule in the NFL that says females cannot play in it?  I think there should be a rule that says that females can actually play.
I wanted to play in the NFL, as a kid I was a tiny girl and never made the team, but now I'm an engineer will pay me in the long run. Luckily my career as an engineer is better than the MLB or the NFL. I wish I could have made theTeam, but luckily my career went to well, I'm sure.
Well, it's a good way to make a good first lifetime. I was a cheerleader in college but I never made it. I wish a player entered, but I think I would have appreciated it more if a player was my best friend. I do not like how the Saints treat cheerleaders though. They have to leave a restaurant if a friend of a player enters.
That seems really rude. I think the NFL should do something about it. Maybe a female player? I know that the NFL uses tracking chips and everything.
That's interesting, they're so technologically advanced.  They track the speed rotation and location of the balls and the players.  I wonder if they are able to track theSpeed rotation and position of the players?  I don't know.
I like to watch the super bowl on the first Sunday in February.  It was really boring this year.  I don't think I will watch the Super Bowl again.
No I didn't but I agree it was boring, I also added some fantasy football so it didn't matter haha, I even did fantasy spelling bee which can be quite boring, but it was better than Fantasy football
Hello there, are you a fan of the NFL?
Yeah I am pretty much. The only thing I don't understand is how they trade team members, kind of ruins it for me. It makes it hard to stay loyal and it kind of makes it harder to stay Loyal.
That is a good point. I like to get into a groove with a team and get into the chemistry and get a groove.  I think it can bring out the best in teams and I think that is why they have to do it.  Do you have a favorite?
Yeah I like the Seattle Seahawks because I root for my home team, but their colors are kind of horrible, but yeah I don't have a favorite one.  Do you have a home team you like to root for?
Nice go Seattle! I like the purple and gold. That is the worst. My team is the vikings. The other team is just the worst, the purple one.
Wooo extravagant colors!  Heh.  Did you know that former Patriots running back Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his entire career?  He has never once fumbled a football in any of his entire entire career.
He did? that is an amazing feat, how does a coach let him play? he must have been one of the better rbs to never fumble, I wonder how many rbs do you think he has, he had to be the best to never have a fumble
I've heard that before, crazy, but I wonder if that's the difference in the money that the top bowlers made over the top football stars.  I know in the 1960's top bowl players made more than the top Football stars!
Probably just a difference in pay in the days of the 1960s.  I think college football has a lot of different difference inpay.
I do like college football, but I don't know how to choose a team. I guess I would say the UNLV Rebels.
I am an Iowa Hawkeye fan, I never knew that.  The team is the only one who paint their visiting locker rooms pink.  I wonder why they do that.
Haha that is nice of them, and kind of funny, I think.
It deals with psychology and psyching out a team and how to get in a calming mood. Pretty crazy stuff.
Yeah, that is interesting! I'm going to paint my house pink to attempt to calm myself down! Haha, yeah, I wonder how many people do that? I wonder if people do fantasy draft for the national spelling bee? I'd probably draft myself and paint myHouse pink to Attempt to calm down.
LOL. I wonder how that works for the spelling bee? Do you play fantasy?
I don't know. I can imagine there's fantasy drafts people do. I've seen a fantasy Congress and points are based on legislative success. Players draft members of the congress and points go up according to how much legislative success they have. One thing I didn't know is that there's a fantasy congress where players draft members, I wonder what fantasy drafts they do
That is a cool concept, kind of like fantasy football, but kind of a different focus on the same things lol, I don't understand the need for fantasy football at all, I can understand it though, what a cool idea!
Fantasy, fantasy, fantasy! I like science and space exploration. I also like TBI, science. Interesting fact about the world. Did you know that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy? Scary, in a sense.
TBI is quite intense, I have had TBI and a hit to the head is very intense.  Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!
Great chatting with you too! Have a nice night!
bye!  Thanks!  Have a good one!
Hello, do you play Fantasy football?
No, I don't but I do like to do it.  How about you?
I do, I enjoy watching the NFL, they have so much time to crunch all the data needed to get the data, do you enjoy watching
I'm not a huge fan of football, but I learned in section 2 of the article that they have a kicker in the final round that is going to be a huge player according to the article, he is the kicker in that final round.
Yes, I am into fantasy football too. I actually have some friends who do fantasy league and I draft players and compete against them.  I also like to draft players for a fantasy league for spelling bee and I can choose from over 100 players.
I didn't know you could have a fantasy league for spelling bee!
I can't see it. I can't even picturing people taking that seriously. I guess it's for children, but I guess there are so many to choose from. Who's your favorite state, if you had to choose one?
That sounds like a fun way to gamble. I learned in section 3 that the comet that streaked through is known as Deshaun Watson. It sounds like fun.
I wonder what makes him special? I know people like to use articles to choose their players, but what makes someone else special?
He racked up over 300 passing yards in all 6 games, and racked up 50 tds in 2, but ended up tearing a ligament in his knee in one of his tds and had to have it torn out.
I wonder if he has a fantasy team, his friend might laugh at him for that injury, I don't read fantasy but if he is the injured player, it might be too bad for the fantasy team
 personally I don't like fantasy novels myself.  I read an article where a janitor from Chicago wrote 15,000 pages of fantasy novels over a 15 year period.
That is a great achievement.  I think I would have trouble writing 15,000 stories.  Maybe I should go to school to get more trouble writing.
He was creative and a janitor! He brought it all together by reading "The Lord of the Rings" and then "The Avengers". Did you know that "The Last Lord of The Rings" was the first fantasy film to win and academy award for best picture, and the first picture to win it was not for best fantasy film.
I didn't watch that at the time, was it good? Did you watch it the same time?
I didn't bother watching that.  I am fond of fantasy literature.  Did you know that university used to study science fiction and fantasy literature when they used toStudy science fiction at the university?
I can tolerate some of it, but I don't really like fantasy, but it is surely a sub-genre of a large field, from magic to science-fiction, from books to video games, fantasy is surely not a sub genre I would tolerate.
I don't like fantasy. I went back to the Harry Potter movies when I was in college but I don't think I would go back to seeing any of the other fantasy ones. What about you?
I hate every fantasy-related produce.  I've never read Harry Potter books or seen any of the films, but I knew of the books.  The films are not very good and I hate them.
They are very good. I recommend watching them if you get the chance.
Me too! Have a nice day!
Do you dispute that NFL is the leader of the sports in North America?
Yes.  I can't believe it.
The NFL allows women to join their league, in fact.
That is totally ahead of the front, they're totally ahead. I think cheerleaders have to leave the restaurants if they're not there on time all the time.
That needs to be addressed.  I think it's the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders.
What amazes me is that they put their bodies through playing NFL. that legitimately painful.
It is sad, I'm shocked that these things happen.  I know an NFL career player can go into it and get a total life savings from an engineer and then be shocked that an engineer can lose his total life wealth.
I guess it just isn't worth it, especially with all the glamour and the worth.  Baseball, basketball and soccer are also great alternatives.  I think baseball is the best.
I agree, I think it is high time we got something better.
A lot of schools are looking for alternative programs but american football needs its glory.
That's sad. I wonder how other sports like soccer can learn from NFL's tracking chips that are embedded in the shoulder pads and in the players shoulder pads to record their every move on the field.
I wonder what they do with the chip embedded in the World Cup ball?  I wonder if it measures any of that power?  Soccer is so different from football in that it's kind of like a chip embedded into a world cup ball, I wonder what measures that?
That is sweet, technology is doing a good job for sport.  I think it is doing it's good job.
Yes they are, I think.  Did you know the highest score in soccer is 222-0?
Wow... can you imagine having to blow out your head? 222-0... I can't... can't even imagine it...
Haha yeah I wonder what happened. I am curious to know. I'm going to google it later, do you ever partake in fantasy leagues? I know I do haha yeah I have one and I use google to look it up.
I don't but I am curious as well.
Do you play any of the sports we talked about?
No, I am a soccer person. What about you?
I played soccer as a kid, can you guess what position I was?
I played as a keeper at a point, good old memories!  I was the keeper I believe.
I played keeper, I wish I played keeper.  If the keeper could control the ball worth a lick at all, I could put it in, pass it to the goalie who was trying to make it to my feet, then pass it back to the keeper. A ball worth anything.
hahaha,  thanks for the chat buddy!
Thanks it was fun and you too, wise one, take care good bye!
Cheers!  :)  Thanks!
Cheers!  You too!
Hey there there do you watch football? Who is your favorite team? I know that I like the patriots, what is yourFavorite team?
I only watch occassionally. I find it a little slow paced for my liking. I can't believe the highest game on record was 222-0. That's way too slow paced.
Yep that is too bad, I wonder how it felt for the people watching at the Georgia Tech meeting Cumberland lol imagine being on the other side of Cumberland, I would have felt like I was at that Georgia Tech Meeting Cumberland LOL imagine that.
Absolutely, I cant imagine!  That would be demoralizing for sure.  I can only imagie the look of the visiting University of Iowa having their visiting locker room painted pink.
I would be demoralized too if I walked in haha I would not want to play in that locker room color, I would be so demoralized
Haha, me too. I would think if they painted people cared more about football. I wonder if bowlers made more money than they do? Back in the 60's bowlers make more than football and even back then when they painted and painted people care.
Yeah, I think that's kind of wild that even bowlers made more than football stars, but yeah.  I do like ESPN winning an emmy for the yellow first down line they came back or creating it, and ESPN winning a Emmy for it too, which is kind of crazy to think about!
Nice.  They deserve recognition!  I think it was an award for something that they did.  Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball and that's why he got the award.  He didn't deserve recognition, but he did it anyway.
Yeah, I wonder if he got an award for that too lol, I'm just glad that he plays for the Patriots a lot, they are my favorite football team and I'm glad that they got the award. Who's your favorite footballteam by the way?
Mine is the Saints but after finding out about the way they treat their cheerleaders it sort of soured me on them.
Yeah, it seems outdated now.  They have tracking chips on the cheerleaders and the player walks through the restaurant, so they know how far they leave and where they are when they get out of the restaurant.  I wonder if they use those tracking chips for the players too.  If they do, they should have to leave the field if the player comes in while the cheerleading is there.
That is outdated and also surprising considering women are technically allowed to be in the NFL.
Yep I agree, but with only 11 minutes of live gameplay in the NFL, it might be hard to qualify as a woman considering it's only 11 Minutes of Live gameplay, so it's hard to qualifying as a women in the nfl
I think so too. I think the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an NFL player.
Yeah, maybe!  And yeah I think it's weird that they use tracking chips in the tracking chips on the field,  it's really weird to see the footage of the plays back when they have it,  the rotation of balls,  how they are thrown lol
Ahah, I agree! On a different note, are you interested in fantasy? I would like to say that I spend most of my time interested in technological innovation and focus on social issues. I would think that the NFL would spend more on technological innovation AND focus on Social issues.
I do do a bit of fantasy.  I stick to a little bit of Fantasy football, I know people do stuff like National fantasy spelling bees, but that's about it.
Ahah, that's very nice of you, but I think that fantasy is not very different from traditional norms. It is a way to transport yourself to a fictional universe.
Kind of like fantasy is actually fantasy, but depending on how your brain is doing, it could be fantasy, I am missing a fold lol. It is interesting to experience reality in a different way, I agree with you, it is very interesting to try it.
Ahah, put that in fantasy and it's a lot more scary. I would prefer to live in a fantasy where the Congress exists and we draft its members completely differently than we do now, but if they put it in fantasy, they would have to draft all of them permanently, which is a lot less scary!
Yeah, that is a weird thing, people do fantasy congress! I've never read that, but I've heard a lot of really good books about it, like Terry Pratchett, he's a good author, read a lot about good books, but fantasy congress is a new one for me. I've only heard of it once.
Did you know that the NFL has no written rule against female players and that women would in fact be allowed if they met the league eligibility requirements?
Interesting, I didn't know that. I played football in college and don't think I ever met the league's eligibility requirements.
Based on the article, they can play if they want to but I think they're biased against age and can't play if it's based on that. It's sexist and it's really biased against them.
Interesting. Did you know that you can watch an NFL game on tv for 3 hours and only get 11 minutes of actual action on average? That is less than the 11 minutes to watch an nfl game that only has 11 minutes and 17 minutes of actually action!
That is strange.  The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetimeEarnings of an NFL player, but the average MLB player is.  I wonder why?
I wonder what the average player in the league does.  The league has come a long way.  I am looking forward to the wild card game today.
I'm interested in that game, who are you rooting for in the game?
The Eagles.  I would like to see the Bears win.  But I like the NFC teams more.  Who do you think will be the best out of the NFC?
I'm not a huge Bears fan but have rooting interest. In New Orleans, the cheerleaders for the Saints are forbidden from eating at the same restaurant as any player of the NFL, and if they are already at a restaurant with a player in it, they are required to leave.  I'm from Chicago, but we have no cheerleaders.  We don't have any in Chicago.
That makes sense though. I think that is something that companies want to do. I wonder why that is. Maybe it is because the Super Bowl is only a few years away.
I like the Pats and hope that they repeat as well as the Bears.  What about you?  I like the Patriots and hope they can repeat
Haha, I am a cowboys fan so I'm going to go with the cowboys!
I thought they had a good game yesterday too, they lost but pulled out the win, I really liked allen hurns, he was entertaining.
Yeah, he is awful.  Things have really changed for the better though,  in the 1960's professional bowlers made twice as much as stars in football.
Agreed. The NFL is using tracking chips embedded in the players shoulder pads to record and record players move on the field.  They also use tracking chips inside the footballs and in the field to track player and ball location and speed and velocity, rotation, rotation and velocity of the ball and to record the ball speed which are located inside of the football itself.
And as athletes get bigger and faster they can also check to see if the equipment is working, so they can adjust the equipment to help the athletes get better.
Yeah, and with helmet and concussions.
That was excellent!  I think it's psychological warfare.  Other teams have ripped off Iowa painting their visiting locker room pink.  That's psychological Warfare!
Agreed. Gotta do what they gotta do! The highest score in any football game occurred on 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0. They should switch it up a little.
Haha, yes I would throw him out lol. Benjarvus Green-Ellis is the only QB to never fumbled in his entire NFL career. He's never f fumble once in his whole entire NFL Career!
He would have been a good fantasy player. Did you know people fantasy draft the national spelling bee?
That's crazy.  People will bet on anything.  Good grief, there is a fantasy congress league.  I don't know how that is possible.  There's a fantasy Congress league?  Good heavens.
Good afternoon!  Are you a football fan?
I am. Are you?
I am a fan.  He was paid $32 million, which is a very small amount of money in my opinion but he was paid well for a fan, I wonder why $32 Million is the amount of Money he was given
I agree, 45 million is a lot of money, I think a rocket scientist would be a lot more of a coach and not just for 45 million, I wonder if there is a rocket Scientist that gets that much money.
I wonder who makes more money as a coach, and why?  It's hard to believe that a game only has eleven minutes of live play, so a coach can be makes so much.  In a game that only has 11 minutes of play, I wonder who does it for the coach, makes more.
I know that the superbowl is almost three hours long and only 11 minutes.  I would think that the Superbowl would be 2 hours long.
The tickets are outrageous, and the advertisements make a lot of money as well.  Did you know that a woman was the first woman to be eligible to play in the NFL?  I wonder if she was eligible to Play in it.
It is a physical sport and there is no written rule against woman playing so yeah I could see a woman playing, it is a very physical sport
I think the women don't have the stamina.  They don't need the kind of money.  Plus they don't know how to do it.
I agree, it would be interesting to watch.  The first playoff game was played in 1932, that is a long time before the first playoffGame.
I bet the tickets were cheap then. I was born in 1975 so I'm not that old. I thought it was in 1932. Did you know that Iowa has a female player? I would have thought they would have a locker room painted pink for a female female player.
Well stadiums are so expensive to build and keep today. I guess they painted them pink to intimidate the other team. And yeah I wonder if that is why, I guess it is expensive to building and I guess They painted them white because they are the only ones today, so I guess there is no need to have a pink one.
Sounds like a good reason to me, I bet they were mad about the fantasy that was-a pink locker room for the other team, what a fantasy that would be, sounds like someone was mad and had a good reasons.
I have no idea but that's how it works, the coach gets away with it. Do you follow college football? I have no Idea if I would follow it if I was a coach.
I went to some Boston University games a long time ago when they had two teams of 3 teams, but I got confused.  LOL  It was fun though.
I get confusing too, interesting fact but only 5 of the largests stadiums are actully college football stadiums, thats so confusing.
That is a lot of stadiums! Those large stadiums have been in use for a long time, baseball has been around for a while but it's brutal to go to a game in one. I wonder how much they get paid to go in such a lot Of stadiums, and how much time to play a game? I wonder if they paid much in baseball
I think football is the more popular game, but they get paid a lot I agree, they get millions, a high school stadium that cost $60M was made in a highschool, football is a popular game so they get made a lot more millions
That's ridiculous.  People should understand that what they are getting is entertainment.  It is a big city, and they are acting like teenagers.  A concert for one team is a concert for another.  Two grown men talking about the same player, acting like they are in a concert.  They are not grown men.  That should be taken seriously.  I mean this is a player in a big, big city.
It is a big city I agree, it is a high school stadium and the flags must be heavy and expensive, a lot of money for a highschool stadium and a bigcity I agree with you, flags are a lot to heavy andexpensive
The flags are definitely expensive.  I know my son's high school uniforms cost a fortune.  silk ones made out of silk for the uniform was outrageous.  The uniforms cost more than the flag, but I suppose I should expect it since parents pay to pay for their son's High School uniform.  They are expensive.
I wonder if they were as expensive in 1916?  Do you think that flags were used then or now?
Hi there, how are you today? You a big fantasy football fan?
Hello.  I have played fantasy football, I don't really know too much about it though I do like the tips.  Do you?
I used to play a little, not a lot, but I started a year ago and it seems like I play it a lot now. I think the season is just getting started.
Well, Julio Jones is a former JV QB who failed to produce points in line with his draft position and that is why.
Yeah, he is projected to have a good season, but not as much success as the other Kansas City players that were projected.
I think that Marcus Mariota will get more passes, the Titans slumped when he took over.
Yeah, I didn't have a team with a backup quarterback this season.  Speaking of fantasy, I was doing a fantasy draft of the national spelling bee.  I did not know that they had a quarterback.  They have a backup Quarterback this season!
I did not know that.  That is pretty nuts.  There is a fantasy congress draft as well.
What's even crazier is that the average game has only 11 minutes of actual gameplay, back to football, that's crazy that an average game only has 11 minutes and a game only had 11 minutesOf actual gameplay!
I heard that.  I wonder if we will ever get a national football league with 32 teams?  They should expand to the 64 teams that we have now.
No.  I think it can't, but I would hope so.  It can technically happen.  Guess we won't see a female player until at least 2023, but that is something I would think.
The NFL has no written rule against female players.
Yeah, I think it would be really interesting to see a girl do it, but I don't know.
Did you know that a professional athelete or an engineer earns more lifetime than a women.  I wonder why an engineer earning more than a professional Athelete.
Wow, I didn't know that.  I guess if they want to put in that long of a NFL career, they could always go for 10 years or so and then put it down.  It's only about 18 years for an NFL career.
True. Engineers are often engineers, not players. I wonder if the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders can eat in the same restaurant.
That is a strange but true NFL facts. I guess bowlers used to made more money. The top NFL players in the 60s made more than the top NFL player in the 80's.
Things have definitely changed for the better.  I think player salaries are probably worth more now with all the chips embedded in shoulder pads these days, but that is just me.  It seems like things have definitely changes with chips embedded In shoulder pads now.
Yeah I bet they are worth a pretty penny, its crazy how much times have changed for both sports and money, I like football and those, they are definitely worth aPretty penny.
ESPN won an Emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for broadcasting.  Did you know that?  ESPN won an emmy for the invention of thesuperimposed yellowline representing the 1st down line.
Yeah I heard about that, they have a ton of TV fans watching at home so I know a ton about that too. It was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good day, and thanks for all the fans watching on tv.
Have you ever played fantasy football?
No I have not but it looks addicting. lol
My brother likes it but I havent played it, but I should.
It is fun, but it makes watching football at this level so much more fun.
It really does.  Fantasy is everywhere including congress, the spelling bee and even fantasy for the spelling Bee!
Wow, I wonder how the spelling bee works. How does fantasy congress work? Lol.
The fantasy congress is where you get points based on bills passed.  I wonder if they get points for getting bills passed?
I don't know if I would play fantasy congress.  I don't think I would like it.  People would probably get super bored to play.  Like football and the spelling bee.  LOL
I do, there are members of congress who dont have any jobs being bored, so who knows.
lol you nailed it right on the head!  The university of iowa painted the visitors locker room completely pink.  They have to play mental games with the visitors in that locker room to keep them out.  lol  That is a mental game.
That sounds like a shocking color for sure. I would have liked to see that. I wonder if they had anything on the walls to throw off the game or something. A shocking color on the wall?
Lol. In the day, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars. Times have definitely changed since then. In 1960's top bowler made twice what the top football star did.
I wonder how it took half of the top bowlers to equal one football star? Or for the top Bowlers toequal one football stars?
lol  Do you know what the highest scoring football game of all time was?  I wonder if that was in 1916.  That would have been the highestscoring football game ever!
Yeah that was 222-0, unbelievable!
Holy smokes!  I racked up a lot of fantasy points that day. lol  lol  I would have racked up quite a lot too.  I did a lot  of fantasyPoints that day..
I wonder if it was the player on Cumberland's team who actually blew out the season..the best player on that season..or if they blew it.  lol
Hahahaaha.  I know, right?  Do you have a favorite of the 32 NFL teams?  Mine is the Steelers, they're my favorite.
I like the Dolphins, but I think they will not be in the super bowl again, do you know why?
Nice, a Dolphins fan for a long time now, remember OJ McDuffie?
No, Ive watched them a little, but I havent followed them closely.  I know that Marino played.
I loved Marino. He was so good! Nice chatting sports with you!
You too!  You too!
Hi, do you watch football?
Hello, I do from time to time. Just watched the Super Bowl and I love the Patriots!
Nice, I am not a fan but I watch it as well, good thing they won.
Apparently Snoop Dogg wrote about a fight between his sons high school football team and his sons High School football team.
Wow, that's good for him! I'm excited to see if it's any good. Did you know the university of iowa's locker room for visitors is painted pink?
That's crazy! I wonder if they are mad at the opposite team! A high school football stadium in Texas cost 60 million dollars to create, and that was for high schoolFootball.
I did find that out. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy?
I did know that. That is true, did you ever watch football games with the yellow line?
Yeah that is what it was, it is award worthy!
Yeah, I guess it's not. I know they're not the most prestigious of game but winning an Emmy is still an Emmy haha! The huge American flags that are in football stadiums weigh 1100lbs, I wonder if those huge American flag's weigh anything at all haha
Hmmm, I don't know.  It must be really heavy, right?  How much?
haha ya I don't know how much they are, but I know they are like 20 pounds, haha
Wow, that is crazy!  Do you know what the highest score in football history was?
I bet there is a massive difference between the two, right?
Yeah, 222-0!
I think that is a crazy score, I always wondered the difference between NFC and AFC, there are 32 teams in the NFL and I wondered if they had the same score, but I know there are two different teams, but it was still a crazyscore.
Yeah, I did know that.  I'm not that great with acronyms.  Do youknow Benjarvus Green-Ellis?
I heard of him, he used to play for the Patriots.
Yes he does. He was once the only player who never fumbled the ball in his career
Wow that's cool. Matt Patricia, the coach of the NFL is a rocket scientist and a rocketiologist
I bet he must know enough physics rules to make the game, and career jump.
Yeah he is a genius. Lord of the Rings and the fantasy of the rings.
Hey, how are you? Do you know who the top 3 most wealthy presidents were? I know the guyss are not the top three most wealthy.
I guess it's Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Kennedy. I'm not sure if that's close to be right, but I'd say it's Kennedy would be right up there.
I am kind of close, but I think Kennedy has to be adjusted for inflation, so I'm probably between Washington and Jefferson.
I think they were semi close, but I think it was because they made so much more wealthy than they actually made.
I think it was because Washington and Jefferson owned slaves.  I imagine that they had vast property but it didn't hurt I suppose.  Washington and jefferson owned slaves too.
They may have lost their monetary value if they transacted with the people who were their possessions instead of their homes.  But, if they had freed the slaves, they may have not lost their money.  It is illegal to warm up your car in Ohio, kind of crazy, since cars are the only possessions of most people.  Do you like cars?  I know it's illegal to cold your car and you can't warm it up in the car in ohio.
No, thankfully I do not live in Ohio. I live in Michigan, where it is super cold, and I warm my car up when it's cold, it's illegal here. I wonder why that is? Do you know why?
Yeah, I'm super close to Ohio to Michigan, so we've made a trip there because of the polar vortex, and a friend of a friend has an Audi A3 car.  It's very remote and the usage is very Indian with the usage of the audi's.  I'm not sure how remote it is, but I'm close to Ohio to Michigan so it's not a problem.
Interesting.  Talking about Presidents, the president of Indonesia released 3 pop albums.  Wow, wow, wow.
No! That's crazy! I wonder if he did it in order to learn about history? I wonder why students don't do it more in order for students.
haha good question, maybe so! Maybe Trump should make a pop album with Kanye and some of his friends, that woudl be crazy!
Lol, that would be pretty wild!  Kanye seems pretty wild, and Trump is known for his actions, not his art, like calling himself "art".  Maybe Trump should try his own art?
ya I think they would, I mean I don't think it insteda to me that art is a deal haha, so I'm not sure what they call the album, I think it's art. What do you think?
Lol. I wonder if there was a producer or marketing director at the time, or a producer, producer or Marketing director? I know that at one time there was only one radio station that didn't change the station every time Bing Crosby recordings filled the radio, and I heard about half of them.
Wow, that is crazy, I wonder if he was super successful in that time or if it was just because they were on the radio so much? Have you heard of Zimbabwe? I guess they call their president President Banana. I wonder why?
I have heard of that country, but I have never heard of being called their president by that name.  LOL
haha vote yellow, vote banana, haha. I guess that's how they did it up until 1805 in the US the runner up in the presidential election became the VP. That's wild imagine president being the runner Up. I don't think we'd have Trump and I don's Hillary.
The people of Zimbabwe vote for a president through the electoral college.  I wonder how many of them would have elected a president if they lost the popular vote, but the president has to be elected through the Electoral College.
Good question I do not know but that is crazy!  Did you know the white house guest house is smaller than the white House?  I wonder why?
I wonder who stays in the guest house? I know that in Guatemala, family members or close relatives stay with the presidents if they want to. In Guatemala, you can legally run for president and then stay in the Guest House.
I have no idea personally, maybe Kanye will stay there, or maybe Trump make their album there? or maybe he and Trump make it there to make their Album
Do you own a car?
I do own a car! I lease a Ford Focus but I have not recently been looking for a new car.
Nice, I am leasing a cadillac, I wonder what it is named after?
Yeah it is a brand named after a french explorer who founded Detroit.
Yep you're right! Antoine de la mothe cadillac! Glad they stuck with Cadillac lol.
It's easier to say typically because people can easily recognize and recommend it.  I feel like there are brands that I follow because I feel that people caneasier recognize and recommendations.
I do, although I'm not a fan of the news. I don't follow the president. Do you follow the President?
Not personally, I am not a fan of him, but I am open to hear people reasons for supporting him and I am also open to hearing people's reasons for not. What about you?
I am independent and like hearing both sides, I am not, but I do like hearing stories to make my opinion.  Do you know if he has any wealth, he is not among top 3 presidents in terms of wealth.  Of the top 5 presidents, only 2 had more wealth.
Yeah, I think so too.  The media has been terrible lately.  They launched a venomous crusade against him starting with the mass shooting of the Capital Gazette newsroom.  It was so terrible.  6 people killed and 13 people injured.  Did you hear about that?  I think he launched a crusade against the media and the media.
I heard about that.  No, I didn't know about that, what was going on there?
Yes, it was in late June, 2018.  A gunman barged into a news station and killed 5 people and wounded 8 more, firing multiple rounds and reloading, then reloading and firing again, into the territory.  It was terrible.  Journalists are always stressed about the danger abroad and home when there is no foreign news stories.  This gunman killed people from a foreign territory.
Wow that is very sad! Trump is trying to get his image out there.
Yeah I agree with you.  It's devastating!  Personally I think he is a proponent of killing journalists and a proponent for the killing of those who don't have control.  The article suggesting he is the reason for mass murders is insane to me.  He is insane and he has no control over the number of people he kills so he has to do something about it.  But, I think that people need to think twice before suggesting he has a greater say in something.
Yea, I think we should talk more about the mental health part of it. I think it is a very sad world we live in, sadly. I wonder how many of these happen on the radio? I listen to the radio every now and then, they always talk about it.
I don't listen to the radio much. If you don't count Spotify, I don't really listen to much radio haha. The only radio I don's I really doubt is radio. I know there's some cool stuff on radios, like radio dramas that are free, but I don'd like to listen to those. There's a website that has thousands of them, I wonder if they are free. I wonder how many are radio dramas, if you can even count Spotify in that there are thousands if you don' t count Spotify.
I love to hear a good drama in the car. I don't have one now, but I would love to hearing one on the radio in my car.  One day when I am off work may motivate me to do that.  I would also love to see and hear jupiters storms on the AM radio as well.
No, I think that is cool, you can hear solar activity in the form of sounds and even make simple radios that can hear that in the name of solar activity! They are called foxhole radios and can be made with pencils and razorblades, I wonder how they do that?
I never thought of that, foxhole radios are amazing! I'll have to check that out. I think I will go check it out now, nice chatting!
Yeah I kind of wish I had some sort of electrical engineering degree, but it's crazy that a college has a program in Finland that is conducted in classical Latin. It's crazy!
wow, I need to check that out, I will have to check it out! Take care, have a great weekend!
Hello, do you like to listen to the radio?
I listen to radio dramas sometimes. There is a good site with thousands of free episodes of old ones. Do you?
I am not familiar with that site, I am not sure what they call radio dramas and I think what is free are podcasts. Is it a podcast or a site?
Yeah, those are the radio show format.  I don't know if the drama podcasts would be interesting or boring.  There's a radio station that broadcasts news in latin and in latIN.
I don't understand Latin, so I don't know if it's boring. I've heard of that.  I don's have a like button on my radio and can't understand it.  If I could only understand Latin.  Did you know that cars in South Africa can equip their cars with flame throwers to prevent from stealing their cars?  I wonder how often they launch them?  If they have flame thrower button on their cars in North America, would they have to launch themselves at flame throwERS?  That's something I've never heard.
I can imagine cars in America with flame throwers, that lunatic must be in deep trouble.
I know! I wonder if the cars would equipped with those would keep people from stealing them?  I know that would never fly here.  I wonder why the only ways to get to work are drive-thru's that were made popular by McDonald's to accommodate soldiers in uniforms.
I do use the drive-thru service, it is a great invention, I couldnt imagine my life without it, I guess we owe soldiers a lot, the drive the way it saves life saves me, I think its a great invented
Yes they save lives.  I like Chick Fil A because it has the speedy service I like.  The car brand Cadillac was named after a French explorer who just happened to found Detroit and so the car brand cadillac was named for him.  He happened toFound Detroit!
I don't know, I think it was a Benz? I know Cadilac was the name of a car, I'm not sure if it was the Benz or not.
Yes, the first car was Benz and it was manufactured in 1886.  I wonder if they made them equipped with flame-throwers?  Do you care to elaborate?
Yes, it was Ford and it was made in the year 1886. I wonder how many people used that car for that year and how much it made.
Ford had actually perfected it in 1886 because they perfected the whole manufacturing process.  I always thought it was Ford.  It's just crazy that Jann Mardenborogh beat 90,000 people at the game Gran Turismo to get a car.  Did you ever play that game?
I did play it as a kid, I knew I was playing way more than I should have, I wish I knew that I could have become a pro driver, I would have practiced a lot more lol, I could definitely have become like a proDriver.
I would have too.  But then again so would the president of Indonesia who released 3 pop albums while in office.  That's a great accomplishment!
I guess he had a lot of free time when in office? 3 pop albums while in office. I guess he was not worried about being a citizen of Indonesia.
I would be worried too.  Our tax dollars are being siphoned for personal use, which is a bit unprofessional.  I don't like that our tax dollars have been siphoned off.
I would be worried too, especially because of the tax dollars of citizens, I wonder how much of a job his recording songs on the album is. I know it's expensive but he's been doing it a lot of time, it's probably the best job his recorded so far, I'm worried about the tax Dollars of citizens.
Yeah, and the president of Zimbabwe is called President Banana. The first president of zimbabwe has received a nickname for his pop endeavors.
That's funny he's called Banana!  I think it's funny that until 1805 the runner up in the election would become vice president.  I wonder if that was because he was the runner Up?
Interesting, I wonder what would happen if they changed the rules so that the runner up was from the opposite party?  I think the runner Up would be from the same party, but I'm not sure.
Cars have really changed the way we look at life
Amazing.  The drive thru was invented by McDonalds!  super convenient.  And yeah it has made America lazy, but it is amazing.  It has made us more willing to drive, which is amazing!
Yes it is.  The trunk of the car is called that because old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back.  I can't imagine why.
lol yeah,  that is so heavy,  you would lug that thing all the way to spend the night somewhere..  and then back to the car everytime you're spending the night anywhere.  ugh.  i would have to lug that back and forth in my car every time.  lol
That would be super inconvenient.  Interesting that Jann Mardenborough became a professional car race car driver by beating 90,000 people at the video game gran turismo by driving his car by beating people in a video game!  You'd think they'd find a better driver than a video video game.
Yeah I don't know,  maybe he was just a good driver,  I don' t think I could be a good Driver,  or even a professional gamer lol  that game has no pedals,  so he must be a professional game gamer lol
I understand, right?  Here's a terrifying car fact for you: In South Africa, it's legal to equip your car with flame-throwers to prevent carjacking.  Do you think that's legal?
Yeah, I agree!  That seems like an extreme way to go about car theft and I agree with that law lol wow,  I wish it were warmer here in the US.  I wonder if the snow clearing is easier in places with flame throwers on the driveway than it is here because of warmer, warmer weather?  But,  car theft is still a problem and I would like to see more places to try this law.
I never thought about that, but I know it's not an issue in this area. In fact, I learned that the fact that it's clear is named after the french explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac who founded Detroit.  It's named after him!  I wonder how clear it is.
Lol that is interesting, he does sound french, I have never been to Detroit, I wonder why he was from there, does that mean he didn't like Detroit?
I know, right? Do you enjoy the radio?
Absolutely!  I like it because of the sound of it!  Have you heard of that free radio station that plays radio dramas that are audible lol?
I think it would hold up over time, I know they are extremely popular, they have a website that has them, I wonder if it is on the same website as the one they hold, I'm sure they are.
Nice, that would be nice if I had a good AM signal on a long road trip saved up for a road trip.  I forgot to tell you that you can download a book or device to listen to classic dramas on the radio for free.  Good way to have some options.  It would be like having a download of the best book on the road trip, or a good signal and a radio for a long Road Trip.  But, I forgot the radio.
Yes, that is a way to pass the time! According to Canadian law, radios are required to have at least 40% of music played be Canadian, but all radios are requirement to have 40% music played.
Omg, poor Canadians... I wonder how many of the songs on the radio are Justin Bieber.  It would be cool to have some of his songs on there.
I hope they don't! That's really unfortunate for them, I know.
Did you know that Justin Bieber's "baby" song is voted the worse video on YouTube lol I think I read that before, I wonder why that is?
I had heard that!  Another radio fact I like is that soldiers in WWII made simple radios using a razorblade and pencil as a diode, dubbing them foxhole radios.  I wonder if they used the same radio fact that soldiers made simple radio in WWII?
I wonder how that works?  I honestly wonder how it even works.  I know that soldiers radios had to be very strong and they could not have picked up Jupiter's storms because the pictures show them as strong as they were.  So I wonder if they had to wire or code lol I dont know if the storms can pick up the soldiers radios.
That's a good question.  I'm not sure.
How do you feel about the shooting in Annapolis?
I think it's a shame I hate that there are things like this, but it's not my thing.
I agree with you. I understand why people always kill other people when they are unhappy, but I don't understand why they have to kill each other.
It seems to be a trend in America.  Someone armed with shotgun and smoke grenades seems premeditated.  It seems like it would go both ways.  To me it just seems like a trend.  Going armed with Shotguns and smoke Grenade seems premediated.
 smoke grenades are the key. I understand why they would use smoke grenades.
Did you know that the Capital Gazette published a story on it?
He was a teen in high school and his mind was not on his mother and his gun violence.  It was a very serious situation.  He was a teenager, but not a teen.  I can't believe he was able to do that.
I know it's always on my mind as well, it can't happen to us here, but it is getting worse, we need to be more cautious and not let it happen.
True.  I wish the government would implement some type of gun control or background checks, but it is just not possible.
Yes, firearms are big business in America the governments are not doing much to stop the money train.
i feel the exact same way. It's terrible that money is more important than American lives.
We are addessed with our mental health and it is getting even moreAddessed with it, I think.
I partner that mental health is a big issue, gun violence and homelessness are as well, if more money were put into mental health, I think we would be able to get away with gun violence too.
I know, I think America is the only one who does not.
Money is the answer to eveything, it seems.
I dont think this country will ever get out of the bad times it is in.
I agree. I think we are all in this together, but we can't let the politicians get away with it.
I know right, they turned a blind eye to it, they have been doing that since the 60s.
I know, right? What did they do?
The government is on the citizens side of things, not so much the citizens.
Yes, things could change for the better if they do.
I wish we could all be on the same page and stop fighting eachother, maybe one day we will all be able to get on the Same page and stopped fighting each other
I hope so!  How about you?
I think it is time we did.
Yes it will. I think so too.
Do you know who the president is?
Washington is paid by gun lobbyists, but he should try to implement mental health screenings for gun purchases and try to regulate them.
That would be great, that would help a lot and help keep us all safe, I think.
Yes, that would be a good start.
Hello - how are you today?
Hi! Good, how about you?
I'm good.  How are you?  Do you like radio?  Radio waves are a technology used to carry information, sound, and energy transmitted through space.  They are transmitted by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy and transmitted through sound, sound and radio waves.
I didn't know that.  Jupiter's radio storms are so strong that they can be picked up by earth's am radio waves.  Wonder whether or not they're as strong as the Jupiter radio storms?
Absolutely! Did you know that according to canadian law, all radios are required to have at least 40% of the music played be canadian?
I like thatlaw, it makes sense with the strength of radio waves, and surprising that they can be made with a razorblade and a pencil, I wonder how they can do that? I wonder if they can get away with it using just a pencil? That's surprising considering the strength
Wow that is amazing!  Did you know there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free?
I wonder if the radio dramas are any good.
I agree, I like history and listening to things from a time when there is less history and listen to something from now.
Speaking of history, do you know that the top three richest presidents were Washington, Jefferson, and Kennedy.
That is crazy, also crazy that the president's guest house is larger than the White House, I wonder why that is?
I wonder if that is the reason why they started to build the guest house before they built the actual one, the president's house.
That's a good possibility I guess, lol,
Yes, back in 1805 things were different.  The runner up of the election became the vice president.
I didn't know that the runner up in a presidential election automatically became the vice president.
Yes, but now the VP functions depending on the type of government, and the presidents.
I do remember learning that. Well, its been good talking to you, I think I will go now.
Good talking to you as well!
Have a good day!  Thanks!
You have a day, too! Did you know the president of Zimbabwe is actually called president banana?
lol  I wonder what that was all about.
Hi! Are you interested in astronomy? Jupiter has radio storms that can be heard on am radio.
I didn't know that. Radio waves to carry information are a new technology and now radios are required to have at least 40% of music played by Canadian.
That is unique to Canada.  I've heard that in Finland, a radio news program is entirely in Latin.  That's a news program, not like in the US where there's a radio News program in all latin.
There is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas free.
Soldiers would make simple analog radios.  A razorblade and pencil would be the diode.  Today a lot ofradio is digital.  I wonder how soldiers would make those.
In olden days lot of other sources to hear news from. radio station make more interesting, radio station.
President Trumps sotu address was the 1st carried on radio since 1989
I'm not sure.  The title of the president vary by the form of government and the leaders of republican states that have the president are known as president vary in the title and as leaders of Republican states.
Well, I don't know that many Presidents in the past. Did you know that Trump is rich but not the richest of all presidents?
I don't think he is. The US president's guest house is larger than the white house. I don't know why. Did you know that?
I didn't know that. I recently learned that the US presidential candidate selects his or her running mate before the election. I think today's election would be fairer if the runner-up becomes the running mate.
I think it's better.  Did you know the first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana?
That's an interesting nickname! I wonder if it makes Trump professional in any way. The Indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office, I wonder what mundane endeavors he has done since? I wonder whether the Indonesian president's released 3 albums while he was in office. I wonder how Trump's professional endeavors are going.
In 20th century, car, a wheeled motor vehicle is used for transportaion, cars became a global means of global transportaions.  Car is the first car.
I would like to see the Cadillac presidential limo nicknamed the " Beast."
I don't know much about it.  I know the Germans are good in car manufacturing.  Do you have a favorite car?
Ford man, my powerstoke pickup, I quit using it on the farm so I can have the Ford.
Benz was first to makes airplanes, and they are so safe and comfortable.
Yes, it is a great brand. It is considered the first automobile, it was patented by Karl Benz in 1886. It was a real name for a real automobile.
I did not know that!  It was firstly designed for racer and it is the brand that is used by many people.
I guess it got its start on the diner table, McD's added drive-thrus to help soldiers who couldn't get out of their uniform.  I guess it had something to do with the dashboard of the soldiers, and they couldn't start at a diner.
Cars used to be used for military purpose and make soldiers for travelling. Now cars used for other military purpose also and make more easy to move in olden days.
It was literally a wooden trunk strapped to the back of the car.  The front trunk was the frunk of the trunk and the back trunk was actually the engine at the time the car was first used.  Tesla cars have a trunk on the back.
I wonder why? The car brand cadillac was named after french explorer atoine de la mothe cadillac who founded detroit and was namedafter french explorer cadillac.
Interesting bit of trivia! Chevrolet is named after a race car driver, that's what the name says!
I did not.  I wonder why they did that.  Is it because it is a brand with more advertisement?
I was thinking of race car drivers.  Did you know Jann Mardenborough got into the drivers seat by beating 90,000 gamers at Gran Turismo.
I did not. Thanks for chatting with me, have a great day!
Good bye!  Thanks!
Hi, do you like to drive?
I do not drive a lot but I do commute. I have to in life so I drive a whole lot.
Yes I have moved away from cars. I think it's amazing how the economy and development is centered around cars now.
It really is, I commute from DC, and the technology and innovations fly by year after year.
I simply drove to and from a big city. It's about an hour and a half in a bigcity. I like car radio.
Sounds like you commute quite a while. I used to commute to and from school and back home in my car too. It was a long way to get to school too. I did use the radio.
The real question is, I've recently been reading that they have radios in them.
I do not use it in my car, do you?
I use it daily and I am the same.  I only use it on my phone for music.  That is the only consistent use of my phone.  It is the radios world.  Are you interested in the deep space exploration or deep space radios world?
I know the answer to that! Give me a phone that has bluetooth and I can give it to you at any time. I think there are radios in Jupiter that use bluetooth.
Yes, Jupiter have radio storms so strong that you can detect them here on Earth with radios.
I wonder if it is on a AM or FM radio?
I think so, but foxhole radios of WWII weren't as sophisticated as the ones now.
I think they are called walkie talkies.
I thought it was because walkie talkies intercept noise.  I know they are connected to pairs of them but not how they get them.  Do you know how walkie talks are connected?
I wonder if soldiers were grouped in pairs, did they have contact with each other using walkie talkies?  Maybe there was a conspiracy?
lol, foxhole radios in wwii were made with a razorblade and pencil, I have no clue how that works.  I wonder how the foxhole radio's in wyII were made
Interesting, I don't know either. I wonder how they were able to make radios like that.
I have no clue how that would work. In any case, I enjoyed our chat. I have to get going, in any case.
I enjoyed chatting with you as well.
Have a nice day. I will.
Do you like sports?  I watch football, but don't care for basketball, don't really watch football either.
yeah I like football, i dont watch basketball. sundays are mine, and i watch football. i dont like the kneeling and protesting.
I think the kneeling was a protest to police violence in the United States, agree or disagree?  It's a requirement by law to say the anthem and pledge of allegiance as a requirement of the united states.  I think it's a protest against the police violence, not a protest of anything, just a protest.  It seems like a protest, and it's not going away.
I do not agree with the protesting. I think players should protest all the time, but it is not the first time one has been active in that way.
I agree, I wanted it to be blown out of proportion. I hate when it is all just publicity for what they wanted.
I think the NFL is like the culture and thought police.
I feel that the whole thing is just a way to try to protest the NFL.  It is like they are offended that someone might want to protest anything these days.  The lowest scoring superbowl in history was the lowest scoring Superbowl in history.  That is awful and a sure thing that they would do to protest.
 yawn, I didnt even watch the superbowl this year, Im not a huge fan, and I did see the patriots win.  Yay, yay, patriots!
Yeah that was extremely boring.  What was your favorite TV show to watch?  I like to watch them all, but I can't keep up with the score.
I watch a lot of tv trivia.  I think I watch a little TV every year, but not as much as I used to.  Did you know that there are 750 episodes of pokemon?  That's about 50 a year for 16 years and then a run of 750 episodes.
Yeah my nephews watch Pokemon on Netflix, but I just found out they are silly and don't watch it. There was a UK version of that 70's show that was canceled after 10 episodes.
Yeah, I think that's kinda funny, I remember that 70s show.  I think I've seen it once or twice.  Hard to remember though, there is only one episode of the Simpsons without Bart either not mentioned or appearing.  It's the only episode of The Simpsons without bart.
Yeah I can believe it.  I've been watching Game of Thrones on my Netflix lately, I get bored of it too late and I like watching Game Of Thrones on the late night TV.
Ahh yeah I have to binge watch the whole Game of Thrones series because there are still a few more released that I want to binge!
Yep, the first season starts April 2018. I love that it takes so long to finish the books, I don't know how it took them so long in this season but grrm I would love to see it.
Perfect.  I am looking forward to them all returning.
Yeah, it will be interesting to see how John and Daenerys deal with the "actual heir to the throne", if they do.
Yeah, it will be interesting for sure and hopefully good for them.
Yep.  It was nice talking to you, have a good day!
You too! Thanks! :)
Good conversation always makes these hits come.
Do you enjoy the NFL?
I am a sports fan.  There are some interesting things I learned about recently, like the average NFL live gameplay is only 11 minutes per game, which is interesting things i learned about.
I'm not surprised.  It's not just the extreme amount of commercials, reviews, penalties, and the extreme amounts of TV.  I wonder how they get away with that?  I also wonder how the NFL will allow female players to play if they meet eligibility requirements but without a large enough following and written rules, I doubt it.  They have a large following, but no female players have yet to meet the eligibility requirements and are likely to face serious reviews and extreme amountOf commercials, I'm not surprise.
I guess there aren't any rules against women? I don't know if a woman could meet the requirements but I guess it could helped with the informations. Did you know the players have tracking chips in their shoulder pads and the ball? I wonder if that helped with those informations?
I think they track them very closely too.  They use the cameras and the Refs to make calls.  I wonder how precisely they can track them.  Maybe through cameras that they can closely track the refs to see how closely they are following it.
I have no idea. I also didn't know Air Jordans were banned when they were first introduced, but they were so popular that they were later on introduced again, and Air Jordos were banned again.
I guess they did not want advertisement during games. Jordan wore them anyway. Nike paid his fines and he considered it product placement, so he wore them. Nikepaid his fines because they considered it Product placement.
WOW! That is correct. I guess the fine was just to cover the $40,000 they had to pay for the contract with Reebock. I wonder how much Allen Iverson had to cover that? I guess it was only $800,000 a year until he is 55 and then he can get a new contract with Renebock.
I didn't know that he had that huge contract. He is set for life. Reggie Miller had a huge contract too. He scored 40 points once in high school and broke 8 national records. He and his sister were the best basketball player in highschool. They scored 105 points and scored 105 each.
It is interesting that it is partially genetic and not ability, that is interesting.  I wonder if the NBA includes a team in the Canada, since every team in that NBA includes someone from Canada.
Yes I thought so too.  Basketball players are the highest paid athletes based on average annual salary.  In 2014 basketball players made the most, but football players were the highestpaid athletes based in the US.
I would have thought so too.  Did you know that physicists say the granny style technique for scoring points is the best?  I would have always thought that was stupid, but physicists say it's the best technique.
It is a way to squat and throw the ball with both hands, but it's harder to aim and use the legs underhanded. It is easier to use the hands, squat and throwing with the legs, but harder toAim.
I would imagine so. Paul Allen owned teams before he died, I can't believe he would be good at that. He liked to score points.
I don't know but my question isn't a problem, it's an answer to your first question.  A player named Tim Duncan delayed going to the NBA to complete college, he was the only player in the NBA who did not finish his degree and I'm glad he got in because he got into the NBA without a problem.  He was the first one to do that.  I wonder if that was the entrance to the entrance of the NBA or a problem?
That is risky, but I guess it is rare for players to not prioritize their education.  It was nice to learn that they did.  I wonder how tha New Orleans Saints cheerleaders can't eat at the same restaurant as the players and if they leave they have to leave before the players, it is very rare.
I recently discovered this and it is horrible. They should not treat their cheerleaders like that. I think they make around minimum wage so that aspect is not too horrible. I would think they would make more.
That is terrible but I guess if they need to watch a game they can easily afford to pay for it and a lot of them don't, so they can be easily afford it.  There is a big game coming up in late Dec.  after the regular season ends, so I guess it will be a lot better to watch that before the regular Season ends.
I am excited, I want to see if the 3 teams from my conference make the playoffs and I like the Patriots.  I am sick of seeing the same teams from the same conference make it to the playoffs, they always end up at some point, it gets boring and I get sick of it.
I heard that the ref made a "no call" call in the last game and that's what the game was about.  I don't think people would agree with me on that one.  That's why people get upset when a team makes it in.  It just doesn't seem that fun.
I can't imagine.  I suppose we are talking about the Saints game, but it was a bad call in regards to calling pass interference.  There are so many terrible calls in those games, it's almost like a lack of will to play when you know what you are talking About.  The Saints game was one of those games.
How are you? I never knew of Paul Allen and his founding of Microsoft, but I did know of his relationship with Bill Gates and his relationship of the Seattle Seahawks and Portland Trail Blazers franchises.
No, I did not know that. It was sad to learn about his passing.  It was also sad knowing Paul was also battling non-hodgkin lymphoma.  I wonder if it was his wife or kids who was sad about his Passing.
I was reading about that too.  I think his sister is going to run the franchises now that he's gone.  They are trying to sell the rights to some sports like Paul.  The nearest heir is going be in sports likePaul.  He's going to sell it to the nearest heir, who will run the franchise.
I bet she is a fan, and loves sports, but I think she has a shot, but she might want to sell before she tries to sell. I hope she does. I am a fan of the NBA and would like to one day visit the head offices of the nba in new york. It is fascinating and I bet she would love to see it. I wonder where they have the head office and hope to oneday visit the NBA head offices.
I lived in Chicago for 8 years and Michael Jordan was king of the Bulls.  We went back to Louisiana when we came back toLouisiana and he was king again.  Nike's air jordan shoes became the best selling shoes of all time in the NBA because of the Nike Air Jordan shoes.
Agreed. It was probably a wise decision in my opinion. The money they get for sponsorships is insane when it hits you like that. Allen Iverson is another one who had that wise decision to make. He signed a lifetime endorsement deal with Reebok in 2001 that would pay him $800,000 a year until he's 55 and then $32 million, then he would get a lump sum sum sum of 32 million! That's insane, and downright unbelievable!
I think that the endorsements and sponsorship deals are extremely lucrative. I know that Tom Brady's endorsements are, especially after his superbowl win in 2007. Switching to the NFL, I can't believe that after his 1st superbowl won, Tom Brady endorsements are $32M after playing the game for 10 more Superbowls!
No kidding!  I can't imagine he doesn't.  I saw that NFL and MLB players make more in their lifetime than engineers do.  Can you imagine?  No kidding.
I hear you!  I mean, even with star salaries, an average NFL player who is finishing your degree before going collegiate to pro and finishing your career could easily out earn an average MLB player.  I would think that a 4 year career would be enough to make you a star, and a 5 year career could be enough for a second string.  Then you have the rest of the year to go from collegiate to professional.  So, I hear you on the second string, they get paid less, but still make more than the first string!
True.  I think in this day and age we will see females playing as long as they meet the requirements.  The rules are there for females playing but I don't think they will be able to play if they sign up, like the kicker did when he signed up as a kicker.  There are no rules against it in thisDay and age.
I think it was just a matter of time before that glass ceiling for refs came crashing down. The NFL ref officiating a playoff game in the playoffs was the first ever. I think there is no parameters for that.
Agreed. It is amazing how technologically advanced the game has become. I mean, actual live gameplay is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay lasting an average of 18 minutes, so it's amazing how far it has come.
Go figure that the game play time is affected by the advent of the 17 minute quarters and the commercial breaks.
I'm not sure.  I'm surprised there's not more discrimination against the Saints.  Imagine having to leave the dining restaurant if you're a cheerleader and have to leave because the other players are already dining at the same restaurant.  Speaking of NFL facts, did you know that cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurants with the players?  Imagine that!  That seems unreal NFL, but who enters a restaurant to be surprised by that discrimination?
The superstitions revolving around sports is unreal.  I mean, some of the traditions, traditions, and superstitions are just stupid.  Like the fact that NBA players can't shoot "granny style" since it is proven to be the most consistent way to shoot free throws, but NBA players won't do it because it is not seen as "safe".  I wonder if that means that if the player throws "grumpy style" he is not allowed to shoot for free?  I know that shooting "grannies style" is proven as the best way to throw a 3-pointer but it is still stupid!
I don't blame them for that approach.  I'm not surprised that it's a silly thing to do since the player eventually has to do it.  The best paid athletes by average annual salary in the world are the best paid in the whole world.  So I don't see why they would do something silly like that.
I guess.  I don't watch much sports, but I do like shows about them.  How about you?  Do you watch much?
I love The Simpson's! I can't believe Bart never makes an appearance in any episode, nor is ever mentioned in any. Did you know there is only one episode where he doesn't appear or is mentioned?
I don't watch much sports.  I do like the LSU Tigers, my alma mater.  That family guy ended with the Tigers as the team name.  It's unbelievable.  My condolences to the team though.  And congratulations to the Simpsons production.
I guess they must have been a fan of the show, I never got into Family Guy myself, I was not a fan though.  I was looking forward to the UK remake of That 70's Show that was sadly cancelled after 10 episodes.  Guess they didn't like it.
I liked Thomas the Tank Engine and similar shows, but it was a different style. I like drama TV better.  Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin, as well as Alec Baldwin and George Carli, all did drama tv, did they not like Thomas the tank engine and similar show style?
I wasn't aware of that, but I'm sure they all served as narrators. Hard to believe that there are over 750 episodes of Pokemon. I never watched even half of them when I was younger. I wonder how many episodes of Manu Manu is. I hope you have a great evening, friend! It was a pleasure chatting with you! I hope that you have an amazing evening!
hello! How are you?
Hello, friend.  Happy Thursday.  This morning, I just woke up and turned on the TV.  The morning news was beautiful, but melancholy.  It turned me melancholy because I couldnt see a future.  TV has improved so much since World War 2.  In white, my voice, voice, my Voice, my VOICE!  But, today, I could not see the future.
I wonder how the echo dot that works is going.
I love mine!  It amazes me how far TV has come since the world began to transition to digital television in the early 1900s and I love it.  One of my favorite shows at the time, one of my all time favorite shows is The 70s Show.  It really amazes how much TV use has gone up worldwide since the early 2000s as the world begins to transition from TV to digital.
I like classic comedy sit com, do you?
I love those, watch them often. There's nothing wrong with classic comedy sitcoms, you can't really go wrong withClassic comedy sitcom.  Did you ever watch That 70s Show?  I know they tried remaking it in the UK and it was cancelled after 10 episodes.
I didnt know that.  I used to watch the show a couple of times.  My favorite show is Cheers.  It was on for awhile but it was about a bar owner who became a show.
Oh nice, I love that show! I used to watch it too! Speaking of bar's, that reminds me of something I just mentioned, Bart Simpson is the only episode of the entire tv show where he doesnt appear or even mentioned! Haha. I love Bart Simpson, and I think it is full of fun facts, like the one today, did you know that there is only one episode of The Simpson's where Bart doesnt appear and is not mentioned or mentioned? I think that is so fun haha!
I have seen the show a number of times, I like it but have never seen that one.  What is it about?
I wonder if it's connected to the Simpsons?  I know the crew from the Simpsons are all connected.  Btw, did you know that when South Park aired its family guy episode finale the producers received flowers from the crew of Family Guy and they sent them to The Simpsons to help decide what episode to do?  Thats so sweet and wild that they did that!
I heard about that.  I have not seen that one, have you?
Pokemon has over 750 episodes of "pokemon"  that's like 50 a year for 16 years straight.  I used to watch hthat as a kid but I'm too busy now.  Never knew there was that many episodes.  Must've been busy.
I did not know that either.  750 episodes is a lot of episodes for a TV show.
It definately beats Ringo Starr, George Carlin and Alec Baldwin who did over 750 episodes of Thomas the tank engine.
I would never have guessed that!
I would too.  Do you enjoy sports and/or fun facts?
I do! I love baseball, football and basketball. I love Baseball.
I am a huge Chicago Bears fan.
I am a Green Bay Packers fan.
haha totally kidding, thanks for the conversation! I am an New Orleans fan in my opinion so I found it really crazy that the cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as the players, they have to leave if one walks in, I found out that the player has to leave after the conversation, and I'm like what do you think about why cheerleaders can't eat in a restaurant and the players have toLeave? haha totally kidding!
That sounds nuts! I don't know why they have that.
Well it was nice chatting with you, have an awesome day. Peace out and have anAwesome day.
Hello do you watch football?
Hi, how are you today?  I do watch football.  Do you?
Do you know that there is onlyone left handed QB in the NFL?
Yeah, I heard that. I guess it's hard for teams to adjust to a lefty QB.
That is in fact the issue. There is a lot of work to work to be done there and a lotof work to do.
I figure it's the only one. I'm surprised there are only two lefties in the MLB and two in the NFL though. I wonder if the NFL uses the huddle because of that. I don't know the origins of the huddles, but I know that they were used in the 1960s by lefties.
Yeah and they had to hide singals for the opposing team.
That is clever. It is a fundamental part of the game. Do you listen to the radio much? I know I listen to it during the game
I do, I was wondering if you can listen to Jupiter on your radio, I think that you can actually listen to it on the radio
I bet Jupiter is very different from the top of the days, but I bet Jupiter doesn't get as much top 40 as it used to
Yeah that would make you listen to it.  In Canada, 40% of canadian music has to be canadian.  Hilarious.
I think that law is a result of the Rush fan trying to protect Canadian artists from being out of their home market.  I wonder if it is a law that is being followed, or if it's a way to protect their artists and the law is just trying to help Rush fan in their home Market.
lol  I forgot about Rush.  Did you know he was a good drummer.  He was.
I listen to some of their music. They were broadcast in latin in the 1980s. I was a terrible hockey player.
Nah, I don't speak the language.  I don's
I wonder if they do the same thing in Finland? There is a program in Latin and they get a ton of volunteers. Some rich weirdo must pay for it.
lol, maybe. The president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office.
I guess he is doing well, I bet Trump would release albums if he were president,
I think so too, but I don't think he would be as successful as he was in Indonesia's successful one.
No idea. They made a law that people had to buy them. I wonder if Trump would do that? He has a record with Kanye.
That would be a good album!
Do you like to play or watch football?
I love the NFL. How about you?
Alex Smith's injury.  He broke his tibia and fibula.
Yes it was a nasty injury. I saw the replay and it showed it.
It was terrible.  A gruesome injury.  I watched live on TV.  It's good to know that the cowboy ankle broke last weekend.  That cowboy ankle is a good way to go.
Yeah, it is nasty!  We've had quite a few injuries this year.
I agree. Football is one of those things that I can watch but have a weak stomach. Too dangerous for those that have weak stomachs. I like to watch it but not so much football.
Do you have a favorite QB?
Das prescott. He had a big responsibility in calling the play in the huddle.
I have a liking to Mahomes.  I was a fan of Brady and Brees for a few years but have taken a liking in the last few years.  Are you a fan?
Awesome. I am a huge huge fan of football. Who were you rooting for on the Cowboys this year? I'm a huge fan
I am too, it will be a tough game against the Rams this weekend, they are good but we have a tough one as well,
It will be tough for the Cowboys as well, they haven't been in the superbowl in a really long time.  I find it cool that Alex Smith received his bachelor's degree in only 2 years and was able to win his first win.
He is back to football now, but with an injury.
True, that is the injury he sustained.Did you know that the QB who created the huddle was a deaf QB named Paul Hubbard?
I did know that. I understand that the NFL and QBs have been around since 1920.
I heard that, I guess it makes their plays look better,
Maybe. I wonder if he was any good? He once beat Baker Mayfield in Halo 3 in an online tournament.
That's awesome! I'll stick to football, I guess. I always thought more people were left handed in the NFL, Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the nfl, I thought morePeople were lefties, but not him, that's awesome.
I wonder if Mahomes is the only one, I could see him throwing some passes left handed or if someone is throwing some pass left handed to him
That is cool he did it left handed.  He must have had an injury or something.
I don't know. He was just stuck in a pickle and adjusted his way to play.
Hi there, hope you are well! Can't wait to chat with you!
Hi, well the Alex Smith injury was really bad, a broken leg, it was a game against the Texans, the texans are the best, so bad
It was, I think he is done for the game.  I wonder what is the best way to say.
Alex broke his tibia and fibula and was going to be sacked after the game, but he did not.
I know who you are talking about, what sport is he in?
I'm not sure, but I know it's football?
Ahhh, football! I love football! Ronaldo and Messi, competing who scores more goals!
Yes, I do like American football, did you know Alex Smith was playing for the Washington Redskins against Houston in the 2017 American Football?
Ahhh, I thought we were talking about a game where players use their feet to kick the ball?  I thought they were talking to a game with no feet tokick the ball.
I did not know that!
Do you like football?  I do.
Yes, the games are similar. Players use their feet to kick a ball and they also sack the Redskins punted the ball.
Are you a Redskins fan?
Not really. I am more of an American football fan, but I do enjoy watching high level soccer occasionally, like the World Cup games.  I enjoy watchinghigh level soccer
Oh man that is great! I am one of those Americans I talk to who can't help laughing at soccer! It is the sport I love from early childhood and I am a good example of how good it is. So sad that it is not as great for all Americans, but man we are laughing at it.
I prefer American football to the fact that we have a national team. I am not a fan myself, but the fact they never seem to qualify for the World Cup is bothersome.
I like to watch American football as well, I hear that the rules are different for some reason and the game was interrupted every couple of seconds for some Reason or another, it's entertaining if they are happening according to the rules, I like to hear that, but I do not like how the game is interrupted every few seconds and it is happening with no offense, I think it's just the way it's done.
Basically, I'm not offended by the fact that word.  Soccer has become a vernacular for something very similar to me.  I grew up playing and it is a passion that I have, and I am not offended.  In fact, I like the factthat word is so similar to soccer.
Amen to that! My brother is so much faster than me, that every time I play my own heart beats 4 times faster than my little one's!
I played football in high school, then college football in High School. I played soccer as a youngster. I never got into football as a big thing here though, I think college football is the next big thing. Do you know the drive thru is a big drive though?
If you were born in Europe, like Poland, you would be born with soccer balls glued to your feet.  You are born in European.
God bless Poland, they have a passion for soccer and I'm aware that there are few sane countries left in Europe and the world. There are only 2 sane countries Left in Europe, and they both have a Passion for soccer
Interesting.  Go Poland!
Poland is a country with a strong economy and strong economy, but it seems like many countries in Europe have lost their " true identity". I think that a strong leadership is necessary for strong economy. I think it is necessary to have strong leadership for a country to have true identity.
That is sad, we should learn from their immigration policy, it seems like doom and I guess it's not, we need to learn how to do our own immigration policy better, it looks like.
It was good speaking to you.
Hello, do you listen to the radio?
I love listening the radio.  Do you?
I like listening to the radio to work, I also like listening on the am radio to pick up radio storms from Jupiter, you can pick up the storms from jupiter on an AM radio
No I never knew that. I wonder where I could find that.
Have you ever heard of foxhole radios before? I used to have one on my commute!
No, I have not heard of them. What are they?
They are simple radios made by US soldiers using razorblades and pencils, interesting how they can be used, I wonder how they are used, they are just simple radios
That is very interesting.  There is a website where you can listen to 1000's of episodes of classic radio dramas for free, sadly I can't recall the name but I know there are over 100 episodes ofclassic radio dramas, I would like to listen to those, I wonder if they are all the same?
Radio dramas would be interesting.  I like radio dramas, it would make for a fun way to go on a long car trip.  It would be like that for a long, long car ride, but on a car ride.  Do you follow the NFL at all?  I do!  I don't follow it much, but it's fun.
I do follow the NFL, do you?
Nice!  Do you have a favorite quarterback?  If so, who is it?
I am a Browns fan. baker mayfield
Baker is a promising quarterback for them, after years of disaster.  I heard he's video games great.  He can do great things.
lol, yes. and yes. he quit football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career. that is crazy. and pitiful. he really should have kept going.
I would have beat him in Halo 3 in that game! lol  I wonder if he ever beat anyone in the huddle.  Do you know how the huddled was formed?  Do  you know why?
lol,  I've heard of it but I don't know how it was formed.  How was it formed?
It was formed in 1932 by Browns quarterback Paul Hubbard, who was deaf. At one point, he was able to tell the other team what was going on with his hand signals by using the same hand signals as the Browns quarterback.
Interesting. I recall him playing for the Browns. I think he was a QB for them too. I could be wrong, but I can't remember that. lol  I wonder if they still have any players that play for the Browns?  I can only recall Kellan Moore being there at one time.  I don't recall him as a quarterback, but if I keep track of players, he's the only left handed QB in the NFL.  There are only 2 left handed qbs in the nfl, so I'm guessing the current one's the wrong one...I don't know if I could lose my mind if I was right, but it's time to go! lol  How often do you lose track of your QB's?
Yes, my favorite lefty was a backup QB for the cowboys.  I think he played at Boise State.  He was a lefty QB.  Vick was a righty, too.  The only lefty that has done jail time, and he did it as a backup.  Well, nice chatting with you!  I need to go get some jail time!
Vick is managing one of the AAF league's 32 teams.  It's been fun!
Enjoy your night!  I will!
hi how are you? do you like Kevin Sheehan?
Is he the person that launched the podcast after leaving team Go?
Yeah apparently his contract expired and he didn't renew it, he didn
Do you listen to the radio a lot?
I do but these days a lot everything Digital now a lot Everything digital. You?
I listen to the radio in the car.
Do you like the radio? Apparently the storms on Jupiter are so strong that they can be picked up by am radio.
Wow!  There is a website where you can listen to thousands upon thousands of classical radio dramas for free.  I wonder if they are free?  I know that there is a site where you could listen to hundreds of thousands of traditional radio dramas.
Free always good, you know soldiers had to make radios using just razor blades and pencils to make foxhole radios.  That's how they dubbed those 'foxhole radios'.  I wonder if those were dubbed?
Did you know that Canadian radios have to play 40% Canadian music?
That is a good ideal, that way they preserve their culture.
I guess there is no rule against it. A lot of artists who are Canadian are known to make excellent music.  So I guess I will listen to a lot of Artists that are Canadian and not the rule.
True. The NFL has no written rule preventing women from playing. There is no written Rule preventing women
Wow!  I did not know that.  I like that people still enjoy it even though an average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live action.  An average nfl game has only 11 minutes!
I know right, there is more money in sports. It is crazy that there are 16 weeks of regular season and only 11 teams and they only have a bye week for the last bye week, there are only 16 weeks in a regular season, that is crazy
I agree. Well, it's time for me to get going, nice chatting with you.
Same here, I enjoyed seeing the tracking chips in the football, and the padding on the padding.
Yes, the tracking chip in the football are responsible for keeping track of the rotations and velocity of the football.  I wonder if that is where they get the name for it from, and if that's where the tracking chips in theFootball are responsible to keep track of?
Yeah that makes sense. If a cheerleader is eating in a restaurant and a player comes in, they have to leave, even if the cheerleader doesn't have to.
That seems like an really unfair rule, I wonder if it actually exists, I mean why would the cheerleaders even have to do that?
I would assume it's because of player fraternization, like in New Orleans.
Yeah I think so. Nice chatting with you, thanks for your time.
You too my friend. In parting the iphone has more computing power than the us nuclear icbm deterrent. Have a good night.
Hi, how are you tonight?
I am good, how are you?
Do you watch football? I used to.
I sure do. I watched college and NFL football games. What about you?
Do you have a favorite NFL team?
I have not lived in the Bay Area for a few years, but I used to live in DC where I used To live.
Nice, did you know there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay?
I was surprised when I heard that, I wonder how they can do that?
I figured they would do commercials and huddles and such. But I didn't know they had a lady tryout for the team. I wonder if they use the clock on the lady tryouts? I don't know.
I think the NFL allows female players to be eligible, but I'm not sure if they are eligible to do so.
Interesting fact, the NFL donates things to different countries like UNICEF, for every minute you don't use your cellphone, the Nfl donates 1 minute to one of their countries.
I don't know, maybe they do but I would like to know that.  Talking about cellphones, did you know that actress Hedy Lamar helped to invent the cellphone, GPS and wi-fi.
That's awesome.  I think it's a reason why iPhones have more computer power than the entire US nuclear icbm deterrent!
I don't know, but apparently there is no correlation between cell phone connection quality and bars of service.
Jupiter's radio storms can be pick up by AM radio frequencies that can pick up radio frequencies.
I'm not sure.  I don't know.  But it is one of the best technologies we have.
I guess they are. Have you ever listened to a radio drama?
I have not but I think I will! It baffles me every time I drive long distance. I found out one of the most popular radio acts in the 1930s was a ventriloquist. That baffles ME.
I know I would like to try it too!  I think I might be talking lol
Well apparently there is a radio station that translates solar activity into sound, you can listen live to the sun's music.  You can listen to the radio station's music or you can also listen to it on an AM radio.
That sounds like something I would like to try haha! Anyways, great chatting! Have a great night!
Hi, have you heard of Kevin Sheehan?
No, I have not, is he a sports radio personality?
Yes he is a Redskins player and now he hosts a show, I bet the show is pretty good, he is pretty old but still pretty good
I hear it's with Redskins player Chris Cooley.
Yeah he is the tight end. I did hear about him on the radio, he is an amazing one. He is amazing.
Radios are fascinating.  Jupiter has radio storms strong enough for us to hear them.  I wonder how they do it?
There is a website where you can listen to free radio dramas on that frequency!
That would be entertaining!  I'm amazed that WWII soldiers were able to devise a radio using something so primitive and so primitive - they had to make one out of a razorblade and a pencil!  Wonder how WWII soldiers could be able to make something from a pencil and a razor blade and then devise a
That skill must have come in handy back in WWII, there is a radio station in latin with a news station in Latin.
Yes, I've heard about the weekly Latin broadcast, but I always wondered why they did it, since it's a dead language. Is there an audience for a weekly Latin Broadcast?
I guess some people like Latin.  I think it would be interesting to understand it.
It would be interesting to read, if you get the chance. I imagine a lot of older transcripts would be, but I am not an NFL fan, so I imagine it would be very interesting to look at. Are you?
I am a fan.  I think it's strange that a game averages only 11 minutes of live gameplay.  The game averages out to only 11.5 minutes of game.
I am surprised at that amount of actual content. I knew it wasn't that long but I never knew it was that little. I'm also surprised that there is no written rule against female players. I wonder why?
I didnt know that, I wonder if there is a written rule against that, do you think we will be watching the Super Bowl on Sunday?
Not really. I'm not happy with the Patriots so I'm sure I'm going to be really happy if they do well. I am tired of the Super Bowl. I think I'm getting to the point where it is super boring.
I'm not a Patriots fan, so no problem there lol.  What's your favorite team?
I like the Bears who made it to the playoffs for the first time in forever, but then their field goal ended up being upsetting.  That field goal record for a field goal was a Bears move in the playoffs.  Did you know that players have chips in their pads for the playoffs?
I didnt know that,  thought it was interesting they have chips in the footballs but not the chips in them.  I wonder why players need them?
It seems like they are relying on replays to help make calls, I wonder if those chips are in the footballs?  I wonder who makes them and how they make calls on the chips?
Yeah, I know that tennis, tennis, and soccer also use chips to make important calls.
Do you listen to the radio?
I do, it's amazing how radio waves can produce such crisp sound
I do too lol.  I like radios too.  According to Canadian law, they have to play at least 40 percent canadian artists on their radios.  What?  I did not know that!
Whoa!  That sounds very popular!  I think Bing Crosby was the late, late, very strict rule.
No I do not. Jupiter has radio storms that can be so strong that they can be picked up by am radio. That would be neat to hear.
Yes, I would like to hear that too. In the thirties one of the most popular radio acts of all time was the ventriloquist, did you hear about that?
Interesting. Soldiers in WW II made simple radios using a razorblade and pencil as the diode, dubbing them foxhole radios.
That is very innovative! Bill Murray voiced the human torch in the fantastic four radio show
That's interesting. I didn't know that.
I remember that song Mmmmbop by Hanson, the song M MMMBop by Hanson was the most requested track on an alt rock Chicago station.  I wonder what the title of the song or artist was.
Hahah that's awesome.  I'm going to have MMmbop in my head for the rest of the night!
Haha. That's a catchy song! Don't forget to turn the radio on and be sure to listen to it. dolphins are able to communicate over telephone.
I wonder if there's a website where you can listen to thousands of classic radio dramas for free, I know that there's one where I listen to billions of classicRadio dramas for FREE!
I'll have to try checking that out.  It's hard to believe how far we've come from dial phones.  I love my iphone, but it's hard for me to think back to when they were invented by an undertaker.  Wonder how that works?
I think it does. I remember using the rotary phones as a kid, do you remember them?
Me too!  It is amazing how far they have come since then!  Apparently the 70s actress Hedy Lamarr helped to invent the cellphone, wi-fi, and GPS.
Really? I had no idea. Did you know that an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear icbm deterrent?
Whoa! That is a lot of power in my pocket! I wonder if there is a correlation between cell phone connectivity quality and 3g service and "bars" of service in your pocket? I know there is no correlation between 3g and 4g bars, but who knows!
I had no idea!  I did not know New York's area code was 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone!  It was a good time chatting with you!  212 is the fastest Number to dial!
Interesting!  I wonder why, but doesn't matter much anymore.  It's a luxury phone maker that hires a london symphony to record exclusive ringtones for a luxury telephone and hires the same orchestra to record Exclusive ringtones.  Great chatting!  Have a goodnight!
That is neat!  Good night!
Hello, do you like football?
I do like football. I've even heard it is a category on jeopardy.
I don't follow it that much but I've heard about it, but I don't have any NFL based knowledge so I will pass on that haha. Have you ever seen the jeopardy show? Do you like that?
It must be hard!  I wonder if they have specific plays or something?
I guess they have some pretty funny answers, did you know that on one episode Alex Trebek was considered the entertainment from a show hahaa? I guess he had some pretty fun answers on that show haha
I think that he was pretty good, but not the greatest of all time of game show hosts. Aaron Rodgers is one of the greatest.
I know he has done a lot over the years but I think he's slow to become the host of an NFL football game, considering the entire game is only 11 minutes of actual live play.  That's really slow for a host, especially in an NFL game that has only 11 minute of actual play.
Wow, that is a whole lot of commercials and penalties in one game, the football sure takes a long time, I think the playoff is the same way, a lot of commericals and penalties for a playoff game, that seems so long.
Wow that is a long time.  Football is loved by so many.  And the money is so much better.  An engineer makes more in a lifetime than an NFL player.  I wonder if football players will ever get to make money?  An Engineer makes more than an nfl player.
I guess I don't know much about the game, but I do know that there is a coach, Matt Patricia, who was a aeronautical engineer before he became a coach.  I wonder what he did before the money came in.  He must have done something right, I guess.  Do you know anything about that?
I love the game a lot, amazing how far football has come since the 1960's.  Back then, pro bowlers made twice as much as the top football players, in the 60's and 70's, when pro bowl players made twice what the top top footballplayers made.
That is bizarre, I wonder why bowlers make more than football players.  What do you think about the Superbowl coming up?  Is the Super Bowl coming up on the first Sunday in February?
That blows my mind. The Superbowl is my favorite of sports and I think I will watch it again. The game has been a favorite of Sports fans forever. I wonder if the players, players or even animals on the field will be the first to watch the Superbowl.
I have to admit, I am not watching it right now but I will be watching it soon. Speaking of animals. There is a lawyer in Switzerland that represents them on the court when the NFL and AFC compete.
I guess I wonder who represents animals.  There are 20 quintillion animals. That lawyer has his work cut out for him.
I bet he will need a translator for sure, animals from distant areas speak different dialects or languages, and the translator will have to help animals from far from there.
True.  I guess Germany is trying to give animals some guaranteed legal rights too.  That is interesting that the loch ness monster has a rights.  lol  I wonder if animals are protected, I guess germany is trying a give animals guaranteed legal Rights!
That is very interesting! I heard about the Netherlands building natural bridges for wildlife that are hit by cars on its roads. I wonder if they will be able to be used to help wildlife that gets hit by other roads.
Wow that is awesome,  that is really smart and kind of them,  I love animals and I think a lot of people lol  That is awesome!
Yes I think its such a great thing they do!
I wish it was a lot better but it seems like we do not want to do that.  I do not like animals going extinct, but I think it is safe to say they deserve to thrive and not be going extinct.
Did you know that there is also a scientific kingdom called animalia?
Do you watch the jeopardy episode?  I saw recently that there is an NFL category for it haha.
I did, I think it was funny, I wonder what happened to it?
I have no idea but I was reading a lot of clues, apparently there were like 10 different answers. The panel even buzzed in and out to see who the answers were lol.
That is a pretty niche subject. I bet there are other more important things to learn lol. That does suck about Alex Trebek, knowledge is the most important things we have to learn LOL.
I agree his diagnosis was sad. I don't watch the games a lot but I watch important games like the superbowl but I do like to watch the NFL. Speaking of the NFL, did you know that there is no Superbowl this year?
I hope he has a peaceful rest of his life.  I hope he gets a peaceful Rest of His Life.  There is only 11 minutes a game of actual play in which I watch.  Wonder how they calculated that stat?
Yeah game is way longer because of commercials, so yeah game is much longer than that. I like the fact that engineers make more in their lifetime than the average NFL or MLB player.
That is pretty crazy! It's a long game and a long job and I think engineers are a lot more stable, but still, that is prettycrazy!
Haha it is, but I don't like how the Saints treat their cheerleaders, they have to leave the restaurant if a player comes in, it's very sexist, I think they should have toleave if a players there, I also don't liked how the saints treat their wishlist, they can't even let them leave the store if a play is about to happen haha
I am a big animal person myself, and I would not want to eat there. People have rights and cheerleaders do too.
ya I love dogs, I love all animals actually, I also like insects and bugs haha, I can't believe there are about 20 quintillion animals on earth, that's a total of about 20 Quintillion animals, that is crazy
I love dogs too! They are awesome! That is a ton of organisms!
I have a husky. She is super awesome. Crazy that Germany was the first country to give animals constitutional rights.
I do not know what those are. I do love husky though! I have an australian shepard terrier mix and I love her too!  I have had both animals and both are awesome.  My dog is awesome too.
That's great, animals have rights too. Animals will apparently develop a white patch on their forehead after they are domesticated, it seems interesting.
I think it is a rogue, I am curious to dig deeper into that white patch, very interesting, very curious to digging deeper.
Cute haha! I think it's an evolutionary thing. Like the fact that hiccups are actually relics of when land animals had lungs and gills. I think that's why tetra and other land animals are known as hicc ups, because land animals have both lungs andgills.
That is interesting, I think that is cool, I like evolutionary things like that, I do have hiccups a lot and I think it is very interesting
Haha yes I get them a lot too and I'm glad that we have a lot better now haha. Did you know that Scotland passed a law to protect the Loch Ness monster back in 1912 just in case it actually exists lol. I wonder if they are trying to protect it or if it actually already exists lol!
That is funny, I would love to see a lawyer in Switzerland to represent the animals like that.
Yep animals are awesome, they come in many shapes and sizes, and many different shapes and size.  Funny that there are millions of them and some are multiple meters long lol I love animals too!
Good morning! How are you?
I'm great! How are you this morning? Good, how are you doing?
I'm good, just watching football and trying to end the last of my watching football.
I do like to watch football, what about you?
I do too. I like watching it but there are only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in a whole game!
I wouldnt buy a ticket to see that, waiting for it to be on.  It seems too expensive.  I know that I wouldnt be standing around for that.  And with a clock, it feels like they run out of clock.  That is why I would not buy aticket.
Unlike the 90's, you get paid the big bucks these days.  I would have to go to the big ones, but I am unlike me.  You?
It was a great time for players. the union was much better, the league revenue was pretty low. I dont know if it was the league, or the union.
I agree.  Did you know in the 60s bowlers made double what they do now?
Bowlers were living in a golden age!  lol  I think they could have used that kind of money and attention!
I agree, I would be lucky to make it to the espn news team if I was a woman and I had to say lol.  I would not want to be the woman on that team.  lol
I think there will be some women who play, but I wonder if they would play in high school or college. Women's bodies are so different.
Yes I agree, there's a small chance someday. ESPN won an emmy for the yellow first down line.
I heard about that.  I guess they used it to create superimposed graphics.
I agree, that is crazy. The university of Iowa has a pink locker rooms!
Yeah I think they should have a pink locker room.  What does the trick even work like?  Does the trick work?
No doubt, but I don't know. I think it's just for the hawkeyes to keep everyone home haha.
That makes sense, they do lol. They should make the locker room in there pink, it makes sense
Maybe a splash of hot pink would do the trick. Great chatting with you, have a splash!
It was fun chatting with you as well.
Have a great day!  Thank you!
Hello, do you like football?
Yeah, I am a fan of the local team, what about you?
I like watching those games. I also enjoy the parties that come with watching them.
Yeah football parties are always fun. Super Bowl parties are too.
The NFL has so many rules for the game.  Every gender can participate in the game!
Yeah that is very cool. A female player made a pro roster once and it was the first since 1960.
Yeah, I hear they are the most popular players, but I wonder how much money they would make and how many popular players there are, I think they would need more money.
Yeah I guess bowlers back then did too.
Another strange fact is that New Orleans cheerleaders are not allowed to dine in the same restaurant as any NFL players, they are not even allowed to have the same name as NFL players.
That is strange, I guess they are not phased by the figure rules, I figure rules are rules.
Yeah I would figure that, but a lot of the players have the use of user tracking chips inside their shoulder pads.
Yeah, and then they also put them in their helmets for measuring impact of hits to make things safer.
Interesting!  I like that technology nowadays.  There are so many types of football, soccer is one of them.  Do you watch it or just football?
Yeah, I follow the English and European leagues, but not my favorite. What about you?
Yeah I am a fan of soccer and I like the World Cup, do you have a favorite team or a favorite?
Yeah the World Cup is always a blast to watch. I usually follow Liverpool from england, how about you?
Nice.  I have been a fan of Real Madrid for a long time too.
They have had a lot of success recently, they beat them in the final last season specifically, so I hope that they can do well in the 2022, they had a little success recently too
hhaha!  That would be fun!  The fans would be cheering for the game, and cheering for their animal world!  I would have more interest in the animal world.
Yeah I'm a big fan of animals and nature.  How about you?
I love science in general.  Crazy that we share the planet with more than 20 quintillion other species of animals and about 20 quintillions other species as well.
Yeah, that is crazy!  Yeah, it's been nice talking with you today, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
Hello - how are you today?
Hello, I'm well. How are you?
I'm doing great! Did you know Iowa has painted their opponents locker room pink?
Didn't happen for some reason?
I'm guessing that pink would make the players calmer, and less aggressive.  Maybe they would be less aggressive and not retaliate by shutting of Iowas hot water.  Pink would make them less likely to retaliate by shut down the game.
Do you follow soccer at all these days?
I follow soccer sometimes.  Do you?
I do, in fact I recently read that the US united uses a stadium called Audie Field for all MLS matches, I wonder if officials use it for United and not MLS matches
Soccer is definitely the most popular game around the world.  That makes it very exciting for sure.
I heard that it is the game of the world, it has been played for a long time, I think it has 250 million players in the world and is played in over 200 countries so it has to be played by many million players.
Who is your favorite team?
I am a big Liverpool fan, I like the old England Revolution, Juventus, Liverpool, Barcelona, and the New England Revolution
What league is it in?
Yes they are.  The leagues have 30 teams in the US and 50 teams in other countries.  You mentioned they are all mentioned in the news.
Yes, there are many leagues, and different ways to determine who the world champions are.
I think it is determined by the position of the best league in Europe and the best country in the country, they determined that from the rankings and then the best making it to the champions league in europe.
Yes. The champions league determines this.
I read that it works differently in the US and Europe, but I'm not sure if that's correct.  I know soccer players run on average about 7 miles per game, but that works differently.
I think that is more than the whole game of a football.  I know that in a football there are only 11 minutes of live action, that is a lot of real action.
Wow! I recently read that the Super bowl is smaller than soccer's 2nd biggest event. I would think it would be the biggest.
I did not know this either.  Thanks for taking the time to enlighten me on soccer.
Yes, it was my pleasure! I love soccer. I used to watching it as a kid, and now I love it even more!  I love watching it on TV! It was great chatting with you today!
Same here have a nice day!
Hi there, do you follow the NFL?
I sometimes follow the NFL, I recently learned that Snoop Dogg actually wrote a fight song for his sons high school team lol, he wrote the song "Fight" for his high school's team lol. Do you know what it's about?
I don't really like the game myself. I prefer soccer but football is a game. I think it's interesting that in the 60's top bowlers made more money than football players. Interesting fact!
That is pretty crazy,  I didn't know that,  thats pretty crazy that a bowler back then was as good as a football players,  they must have been more prone to injuries lol I guess being a bowler back then is why football players are more prone  to injuries LOL
I agree, they earn a lot of money and have brain damage, it is a risky sport and a risky game for a lot more, they get brain damage.
Yeah football players do make a ridiculous amount of money
Yes I agree especially players like Benjarvus Green Ellis.  The guy never fumbled the ball in his entire carreer,  that's an awesome stat to hold onto.
That is impressive, Matt Patricia is a football coach, and a rocket scientist as well lol, the guy isnt even a rocket Scientist, thats impressive!
Wow I bet he is a pretty good coach, but also expensive to hire, he must be really expensive to hired
Yeah, I bet.  I wonder how much he is worth now.
Yeah I agree with you there, soccer is a sport that moves a lot of money,
I have watched soccer on occassion.
I do like soccer, did you know there was a german player that donated his winning bonus to the brazilian children?
WOw that is amazing!
Yeah, it is, interesting fact but soccer makes the most dough out of every sport combined, the players must have a big heart and a lot of money, interesting to know, but soccer also makes a lot more money than the players, the dough is from the players and the sport, interestingfact but soccer is a lot better than the money, I like the sport.
Wow, that is awesome! They are making good money but they get injured a lot so that is why they are getting injured, they get hurt and then get injured.
Yeah in soccer injuries are so common, broken legs that figure represents over 300 million players so imagine how many broken legs That figure represents
Yikes,  lol I hear soccer players run an average of 7 miles per game,  yikes!
That is a long distance, 7 miles per game, that has to be exhausting, that is a really long distance.
I recently learned that Greenland cant join fifa.  They have fake grass there lol
I agree lol, they should definetly install a soccer court with fake grass, I think they have the tech to do it, there are so many pro teams now, they can definetLY install a Soccer court with Fake grass
Hello, do you watch football?
I do. I like the son's football team. Did you know Snoop Dogg wrote a song for his son's son's Football team?
WOw nice. Did you know bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s
I guess it was a really popular sport back in the day
That would make sense.  Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
Hmm I do not, what is it?  It must be a big difference though, like 40 or 50, right?
It was 222-0 Georgia tech versus Cumberland
Wow.  I wonder how that score would go over.  More than half of major stadiums have it, too.
wow, did not know that. Did you know espn won an emmy?
I did not know that! What did they win?
They did it for the superimposed yellow line. Did you know that women can play for the NFL too?
Yes I did.  They even use chips to track the players on the field now.
Nice! I wonder what they are tracking to be specific?
They track for velocity and rotation and rotation  and balls speed and a bunch of stuff
Nice, I think it will make the game safer and much better
That's a good point. Did you know the coach of HS used to be a rocket scientist?
That's a huge jump in career.
Matt Patricia.  What a career jump!
Yeah he sure has. Do you know anything about association football?
Yes I do. Did you know the players run between 7 and 15 miles per game?
wow that is a lot of miles
Hi, are you an NFL fan?
Yes, I like the Steelers.
Me too. Do you know who they are going to the Super Bowl?
I prefer the Eagles, but I know that New England is a team that I like, what team do you like?
Me too! I'm sad the season is coming to an end, I'm glad the playoffs are here, but sad the year is coming an going.
I know. It is going to be boring without football to watch. It will make sundays a little boring without it.
I hope there is soon a woman player in the NFL, at least a kicker, maybe a woman could be the first woman player
Interesting, I wonder how that would go over in the US.
I hate the fact the actual live gameplay is so short.
I know. It's like 11 minutes or so and it's always commercials. It is ridiculous how many commercials there are.
There are too many commercials!  Engineers, and players, get paid more than the players.
Yes they should be paid these huge salaries but they don't. as long as the engineer can make more money, I think they should make more. people have to worry about their futures, as long they can play and get paid these big salaries, people should not have to think about their future.
There is a gap there, but they still make more, they are recognizable players so they have endorsements, so that helps.
Maybe but they make more over their lifetimes in endorsements than they do salary.
Did you know that the saints cheerleaders have to leave the restaurant if players come in?
I had learned that, but I have no idea what the reason is for that? I think the dumbest thing in the world is that cheerleaders are not permitted to eat in the same restaurant as the football players. Why in the whole world would they have to? I have to wonder if it is for a reason like if they are not allowed to eat there, or if they have no other way around it.
It makes the league and team look hypocritical of women being able to do that, too.
Absolutely, talk about degrading.  There are so many issues with the league now on the field, too.  The league uses tracking chips in shoulder pads to record every player's move on the Field.  Talk about degrading...
What kind of stats are collected with that?
I imagine they do, I used to rewatch games and that happened often, I think the chips are really creepy when they do that, it is creepy how they can do that.
I wonder if the Patriots have one of those.
Hi, how are you doing this morning?
Great! Hope you're doing well! It's hard not to follow soccer aka soccer, I follow it too, but I know it's hard to believe that it makes more money than golf, tennis, basketball, football, association football, baseball and hockey combined!
I don't really watch much of soccer.  I didn't realize it made so much money, but I know it's not for everyone.  How much money is soccer?
I guess it is crazy! Mesut Ozil donated his entire world cup victory bonus bonus to pay for surgery for 23 children in Brazil. That's like $800,000 in change from my pocket for one entire surgery! That's crazy! I wonder how he was able to pay that, I guess he has to change his name.
I guess it was. That's alot of money! In considering the consideration it's played by 250 million people worldwide and more than 200 million people in over 200 countries, that's quite alot of kids! But kudos to him, I mean it's great that he did that, in consideration it played out in over 250 countries. That was a great act that Mesut did, I guess.
Agreed! I wondered if any females would be willing to follow in his footsteps and try to follow, but I wonder if females have to meet the requirements of the rules of the NFL (regular football aka gridiron football) to join. As long as they are able to meet all the other rules before joining the NFL.
I don't watch much of the football.  I always wondered about that, too.  Why no females?  Do you know?
There are only 11 minutes of live game play.  I wonder who gets drafted or picked for the team in the first five minutes of play.
True, there's alot of standing around time on the sidelines. I wonder what they'll do if a female is the kicker and a female has to do alot of Standing around time.
Agreed. I suppose it would be a wiser decision to just enter Engineering since engineers make more over the average lifetime than an MLB player. The average lifetime earnings of an MLB and NFL player is less than the average earnings of a engineer.
True, I find it interesting that it's true. I find that wild that in the 60's top bowlers in the US made twice as much as top football stars.
Ha! Just kidding, that is wild! Even wilder and even sadder is knowing Saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as Saints players! They have to leave if someone walks in or they walk in and they have toLeave. That's just wrong and so wrong and I don't even like knowing that, I just don't know why they are allowed toEat in the Same restaurant as saints players and have to leaves if they leave, that's sad!
I bet there was some incident that prompted that rule, something juicy!
I suppose it's something that would classify as "discrimination" if that happened, but who knows what happened. In this day and age, I suppose it would be like the highest score in a game being 222-0, which is not as bad as Georgia Tech once beating a football team 222-2. I wonder if it was discrimination or if the team was just bad. That is a lot of score for a football game in this day AND age.
Yeah, I think the lowest scoring Superbowl game was played way back in the recent Superbowl.  Nowadays you don't see that happen too much anymore, the lowest score in a recent Super Bowl was even lower than the lowest scores in the lowestscoring Superbowl games, but yeah, you never know nowadays.
True.  There are players in the league like Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbling the ball in the whole league like he did.  I wonder what he did?
That is a pretty awesome feat to be able to accomplish! I cannot imagine the pressure that has to be on him for fumbling the ball.
It is crazy.  I would be so crazy if I had to be forced to visit the visitor lockerroom at Iowa and be forced into massage pink after every game.  Talk about demeaning!  If I was handed a fumble, I would have to get in the mindset of being forced to visited by the visitor's lockerroom after everygame.  talk about demi-gifting!
I think a pink locker room would be intimidating for any player, let alone a visiting team. I was shocked to learn that Jon Stewart was a player on the US soccer team back in the 90s. He was very skilled and the visiting team was shocked that he was from soccer.
Wow, that is shocking. I was also surprised when learning that there is actually a soccer variation where three teams face off at the exact same time, I don't know how that would happen! I wonder if that will ever happen.
That is pretty wild, I wonder how that played out.  I would like to watch a game of that.  Well, I have to get to work, it was nice chatting with you this morning.  Talk to you later, friend.
Hi there, do you like sports?
Hello there, I do, I really like NFL football, but I am a fan of association football as well. You?
I do like the NFL.  I watch other leagues of football on occasion.  Did you hear that Winston Churchill High is still around?
I didn't know that high school football was doing well! I have never watched much of it. I usually like the NFL. I do watch Canadian football though, so I've watched a few. Do you watch Canadian Football?
Yes it is high school football and Winston Churchill high hired an nfl corner back to lead their high school basketball team as well as the football team in high school
ESPN didn't mention that.  I wonder if Willie Williams is running the team now, if so, why did ESPN not mention that?
Yes you are correct.  I think the Redskins just got a new QB,  they hired Chris Samuels who used to played offensive tackle for the Redskins.  Do you know him?
It's interesting these guys can go go to the NFL to set up and coach high school football or the pros, or they can coach all their life and still have a career.  I wonder if he has ever made enough money in the NFL or the NFL  to set himself up for life, he could have done both, but he went to coach highSchool football first.
I think they should make their money in the NFL and then give back to the community in some way after that.  They should give back more to the NFL.
Soccer players make more money in the NFL than they do in soccer.  They make more, too.  Maybe association football players can make more if they play all their life.  If you are playing for the NFL, you could be set for life.
I wonder if the same can be said for top bowlers of all time.  Back in the 1950s top bowler/football players made twice as much as the top football players made.
That is crazy! That is so far back! Don't get me wrong I enjoy the game, but the average game only has about 11 minutes of actual game play, and the averagegame has only 11 minutes to action in NFL games.
That is insane. I think that back then it might have been the other way around. At previous point soccer players make more money in that sport than anything else.
They definitely make more money than the NFL, especially the generous Mesuit Ozil donated his 300,000 Euro world cup bonus to help pay for children's surgeries, after he got his bonus.
That is a very generous donation by Mesut Ozil.  He is a German who is also a fantastic soccer player.
Yes he is!  It was to help 23 children in Brazil who were going to have surgeries after the World Cup because the host country of the hostCountry did not allow them to get to the World cup.  Nice story.
Yes it was inspiring.  I can't believe it's already been going on since 1930.
I think it's funny that we call association football soccer, but it originally caught on as a slang term for what we call football.
I didn't know that soccer is slang term for what we are called association football, that's kind of weird that it is a slang term,
I know it is weird, especially because it is a three team soccer, where three teams play each other.
No, I haven't.  That is crazy.  I wonder if there are any actual rules to that type of game or if it is just crazy.
It would be hard to follow if you did not know.
Same here, thank you for chatting with me today. Have a nice day.
Bye!  You too!
bye.  have a good one
Hey there do you watch the XFL? I know that I watch it sometimes, I like it better than the Audi field, what about you?
I do not plan on watching the XFL.  The XFL is an interesting one.  I have not been to Audi Field but it is interesting to know that they share the Southwest DC facility with the DC United share.  Football takes a harder toll on the grass.
Yeah I am looking forward to it, I really don't like the XFL but I do like football, I miss the days before football stadiums and all their corporate sponsors lol like Audi's field was actually named after them, yeah I think football stadiums should be named after corporate sponsors now
True. I'm surprised no female players have ever signed on with the NFL. There are no rules against women playing in the NFL and I'm not sure how many could meet the eligibility requirements. I am a fan of the NFL as long as I can see it playing every day, but I'm really surprised no one has signed on yet. Do you think the NFL has any rules againstWomen playing?
Yes, I want to see a female NFL player someday. It would be boring though, I think the NFL has to fix the issue of only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game. I would think that they could fix that. I mean, we only have 11 minutes and a half minutes oflive gameplay, how can there be no gameplay?
True. It's ridiculous that they can't create a better use of the live gameplay time than that.  I mean, they have chips in the players that tracks their movements and ball location, speed, velocity, rotation, velocity of the ball, movements, and ball movements and movements and then they use chips in it to create a game that tracks all of that and more.  It's true, I like the extent to which they use technology to track the players to get the best possible use out of their live gameplayTime.
I know it is ridiculous.  I mean, player speed and location, ball, rotation, etc.  But, I don't understand how they can tell the ball's speed, player's speed andLocation?
 engineers would be able to adjust the gameplay time so much easier.  MLB and NFL officials make more than the average lifetime earnings of MLB andNFL players but the NFL officials don't make as much as NFL players.  Maybe they could create chips that would make it easier to adjust.
Yeah, it's shocking how much money they can make, I know they make more but still shocking. Do you watch soccer, Association Football?
I do not. It makes more money than all other major sports combined!
Yeah, I watch it, but I think it's really boring, but not as boring, I think. It's shocking that it makes more than American football. I wonder if there's a variation where three soccer teams are playing at the same time, or if it's just American football and just makes more when two soccer teams aren't there.
I bet it's wild! I wonder how they play unlike regular soccer, I wonder if the players are allowed to touch the ball with their hands and arms while they playUnlike regular soccer where the ball is in the players hands and Arms.
Yeah, I've heard that.  I don't know, sounds more interesting than the regular soccer though lol.  Have you heard of the German player Mesut Ozil?  He sounds more like regular soccer than the German Player Mesut ozil.
I admire him.  I like how he donated his entire World Cup bonus to pay for the surgeries of 23 kids who had surgeries in Brazil.  Some athletes are very useful and I admire him for that.
That sounds awesome! He donated like 300,000 euros, he seems like a nice guy.
Agreed!  On a soccer note, John Stewart was a great player in college and was a player in College and the Pan American Maccabi games and the US Pan American Maccabi games.  He also played in Brazil and did something similar, but in a different way.  Did you know he was from Brazil?
That is impressive!  I knew he had played but I never knew he did that before!  Do you know if he played in any regular football aka American football?
I enjoy football in general. In fact, one of my favorite players is actually Benjarvus Green-Ellis, and he was one of the best. In his entire pro career, he never fumbled once and never fumbles once in his entirePro career! That is amazing!
I agree that is amazing. I think it's also amazing that they pay a lot of money for those broadcasts of football games. It shows how much they pay. Did you know that the USpn is known for winning an emmy for creating that yellow first down line for the broadcasts?
I thought it was deserved. I think they are so innovative and it helps us watch the game more when there is a yellow line. It is sad though that the top bowlers made twice as much as top football players back in the 60's. Earlier, we talked about how bowling engineers were paid more than engineers. It's disappointing to me that the same engineers are still paid more to watch a game than to play.
Bowling is definitely easier than being a professional football player lol, I can't believe the University of Iowa painting the locker room for their football player's painting was completely pink.
Do you watch football? do you like it?
I do watch football, I am more of a basketball fan.
I watch basketball too, its one of my favorite sports, what about you?
I am watching the lakers vs warriors right now.
What's wrong with LeBron?
Haha I am hoping for that too! I am not a Lebron fan at all, so if something is wrong I am sure there is nothing wrong with him, I am a Le Bron fan!
Btw, do you watch football games this season?
No, I havent watched much, but I do know that soccer makes more money than football, basketball, basketball (basketball, baseball, baseball) golf, tennis and hockey combined.
That makes sense. Soccer is such a popular sport around the world.
I am a soccer fan.  I make up for that sometimes!
I think soccer players make less money in my opinion in the comparison to basketball player in my view but I think a lot of people don't know this. I think soccer is watched more than basketball so maybe soccer players do make more money in comparison to Basketball players?
Yea basketball players are making upwards of $800 million a year thats crazy, but soccer is a huge sport at the same time, they have so many players and overseas its a huge game, and soccer players are make about $6 million ayear thats crazy
Hahaha, I've heard the same thing, I heard that 2 teams can play against each other on one field at the same time and then 3 teams can also play against one another at the other, mind blowing!  I'd like to see that!  What's the only thing I'd be able to do on that field?  Hahaha
I know, there would be a lot of confusion if three of them took the field at once.
Jon Stewart was a skilled soccer player, and one of the best players at the pan american maccabi games, he was one of only two college players in the panamerican maccabo games to have more viewers than the best jon stewart
I had no idea! I am a huge Jon Stewart fan, but I had no know. Speaking of football, I saw that in the 1960s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.
I'm not surprised.  The top bowler made more than the top football player.  I wonder what happened to the sport though.  Bowling popularity has since drastically decreased.  In the 1960's the top bowLER made twice what the top Football player did.  That is something I'm not sure has happened.
I love bowling! I play all the time, but it's getting boring. I am taking over for my brother who is into Fortnite all thetime. It's fun, but I am not taking over!
I agree.  My brother has his own hobbies and interests and I have my own hobbies.
Agreed. It's a long way to go as long as we both keep an open mind to the things we like and try and help each other out.
hahaha I know right, well anyway its been nice chatting with you today, have a nice one, enjoy the game of warrior, btw, and enjoy warrior 4, hahaha
You too.  We'll get them back stronger!
Hello my friend do you like engineering?  If you do, you could make more in your lifetime than the average NFL or MLB player - engineering will make you more than the averages of an average NFL and MLB player.
Yes very true, she is so smart to do that, I think it would pay off and she will be smart.
If he worked hard enough, he could technically join the NFL, but he didn't meet the eligibility requirements.
Ive never heard of a female player in the NFL, but I know there are plenty who play.  I think it is association football (soccer).  I wonder if there are people in the nfl who play "Association Football."  Ive never seen a female play though.
Soccer is a slang term that Americans use and not a official name, it is not even a term that is used by the US official name.
Yes, soccer is a wildly popular sport but it is not the biggest sport in the US. The super bowl is actually smaller than soccer's third biggest event and the Super Bowl is a much bigger sport.
That's surprising considering how many countries play the sport, I think more than 200 countries play.
Another country that would like to join is greenland, they have a soccer field where no grass grows in the country and no one can join isGreenland.
I don't know why they wouldn't want involvement.  Soccer still makes more money than all other popular sports combined.
I wonder if it has anything to do with the Ivory Coast player who single handedly stopped a civil war in 1854 with the help of some major activists.
That's very impressive!  A german player paid for the surgeries of 23 children in brazil with his world cup victory bonus.  He did it for 23 children that were in need of surgeries.
I think its a great thing that so many players have contributed so positively to society and the soccer community as a whole.
Yes, it is. The community has done so much for the sport and for the community at that. Jon Stewart was part of that community since his college days and played in the Pan American Maccabi games.
That is pretty cool. Snoop Dog actually wrote his son's high school fight song. I didnt know that.
I didn't know that. I also didn't even know that the superimposed yellow first down line that espn created for american football was an invention in the year 1932. It got an emmy for the invention that year, and the super Imbensable yellow first downs line was the first superimposedyellow line that ESPN created for American football.
I watched my brother play live in high school and his mother was surprised it wasnt used.  It is so important, I watched mybrother play live and my mother was also surprised it wasn't used.
I know, right? I was keeping track of the game, but it seems like a lot of the points were only 7 or 8 points. If you score them Georgia beat Cumberland 222 to 0.
Wow, I wonder how the other team was doing, the game was over with only 11 points scored and 14 turnovers by the otherTeam so it was bad,
I don't know.  Do you know what the highest score to occur in a football game was?
I know right, did you know 16 of the 25 largest stadiums belong to college football teams?
I don't think the atmosphere of large stadiums helps the NFL.  Players are not drafted into the NFL as much as the teams want them.  It is a different atmosphere with the teams.
Hi, do you like soccer?
I do a little bit, but not as much as I do American football, especially the NFL, the league with 30 teams that make up the NFL.
True, do you have a favorite team?
I am a Packers fan. That is a great team. I like a lot of football players. Did you know that the average NFL game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay? That's not a lot! I wonder how many football players go through those 11 minutes, since an average NFL games only has 11 minutes and 17 seconds of liveGameplay.
I heard that.  I wonder if that is accurate.  Are you a Bears fan?  I am.  There is no rule against woman playing football.  No rule against Woman playing football?
Funny!  Hard to believe the average lifetime salary for an engineer is more than the average NFL player.  An average lifetime Salary for an average engineer is around $40,000!
Agreed. Saints cheerleaders have to leave any restaurant a player walks in on, which is sexist.
I think that is sexist as well. I wonder if the NFL uses tracking devices on them.
No, I didn't. I wonder what kind of tracking devices they use? What kind of tracker?
They have chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field.
They embed chips in your belly?  I'll have to push my kids to try that. Soccer makes me want to have more doritos.  Football is not for my belly.
Yes, soccer players make more, but Americans call it soccer because it's slang for association football, not football.
I know, it is a different game, with three teams playing each other.  I wonder how they work together in a game, though.
No I'm not sure what sport that is, do you mean football or soccer? I am talking about the US sport
 soccer.  I like the triangle field.
It would be. NFL'er Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the football in his career!
I did not know that! I did know that the Patriots had a RB that played for them for 6 years. He had only one fumble in all those years, but that was imppressive! He got benched by 3 teams! I wonder why he didn't fumble more, it seems imppressed.
It's hard to believe that the top bowlers of the 60s made more than the top FB stars.
The highest score in a football game happened in 1916. It was 222-0!
Wow that is a big score. I wonder how many teams were in that?
Georgia Tech and Cumberland. Nice chatting with you!
Football is a family of sports involving kicking a ball to score.
I did not know that. But there are so many types of football throughout the world.
Yea, there is Canadian and Australian rules football, I think, right?
And dont forget soccer, or association football!
Yea, football is a pretty popular college sport, Georgia Tech won a game scoring 132 points in 1916, the only game ever, and football is the most popular college sports, Georgia tech won agame scoring 222 points
That's quite a bit! I wonder if they were able to run the score up that high?
I wonder why? Did georigia tech really dislike cumberland?
It's hard to imagine they do. ESPN won an emmy for the yellow first down line on football games. It's hardto imagine watching a game without that.
Yea, that superimposed yellow firstdown marker was a godsend.
It helps us not forget the players are actually playing on the line and not just looking at the line to be able to see what is playing.
That is pretty crazy. I think it is pretty Crazy that on average there is only 11 min of live gameplays. And no one injures football!
And the time is so short, the injuries are getting stronger and faster and the players become better, but still, they get injuries all the time.
Yea, that's one of the reasons why the NFL embeds tracking chips in the players' equipment
The 16 week regular season and then lenghty playoffs can lead to a lot of injuries due to wear and tear, especially in a 17 week season.
Yea that is definitely the game, it's really grueling and there are no rules banning it, do you think that a female player will ever be able to play? there is no rules against it and they have no rules bans, I would think.
I don't know, but as long as one meets the requirements, I think there can.
I suppose it can, but I wonder how much of that is made up. I mean, why would the Saints get rid of a rule requiring cheerleaders to be at certain places and at certain times of the players? I mean they made it so that they can get away with it, and why would they need to do it? Why not just have the Saintsget rid of that rule?
Yeah, they can leave the table if players show up at the restaurant, but I guess there will always be hanky panky at the table. I wonder if they have to leave thetable if playersshow up.
I know the Saints rule sound antiquated and sexist, but why not? They are adults.
I agree with you.  They're being overly cautious to try and avoid any legal problems.
Nice chatting with you!  Have a nice one
hi, do you like soccer?
I like it! Did you know people all over the world play it?
Yes there are 250 million in the US alone and over 200 million in other countries
Yeah. Did you know that in 1932 a team in the US scored a goal and did not advance?
Wow.  I did not know that.  Did you know that sport makes more than all other sports combined?
Wow. Drogba once stopped a civil war in a country once
WOw amazing. Jon Steward used to be a soccer player too
Nice. Lots of talent in the host. Not only a soccer player, but a host too.
He represented the US at the panamerican games in Brazil in 1983.
wow cool. The Superbowl is very small compared to soccer events, only once in a while
wow that is very small, but I guess that is how people get into the sport, not everyone works on the sport.
Yeah true. Did you know Greenland cannot join fifa?
Yes that is it.  I did not know that.
I think it is because Snoop Dog wrote a song about how his son's team used all the grass on the soccer field.  Snoop dog wrote a music song for a son's soccer field
Wow, I didn't know that. Do you like the NFL?
I do. Snoop dog wrote a song for his son's team.
That is so cool, I didn't know that. Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink!
I wonder if it is supposed to have an impact on the other team?
Probably, doid not know. Did you know ESPN won an emmy?
I did not know that. How did they win it?
I don't know but it was for the superimposed yellow line. Nice chatting with you!
Are you a big fan of football?
I like high school football, which I find really boring, but not so much high school.
Yeah I follow the NFL a little bit but mostly my local team, and yeah I followThe NFL for our local team.
I agree.  Some parents don't allow their children to play because of health concerns.
Yeah I don't want my kids to play football. I saw the movie Concussion and I don not think I would want my own kids toPlay football.
I did! It was good! I thought it was great, I thought the whole Will Smith movie was really good. Have you heard of the coach Willie Williams?
Yeah, I heard of him.  I don't think he is damaging the sport though, his thoughts are that people watch too much TV and that's why.  Do you agree with his thoughts?
I agree with that, I expect a lot of people to kick themselves in the coming years after seeing the movie, I think it will kick off a lot more.  Things have changed, in the fact that in the 1960s bowlers made twice as much as football stars.  I can't believe it.
Yeah that is a wild fact. I guess the thing is that I have never been a bowler in my life, so I guess it's just a wild Fact.
That's a lot easier physically than football!  ESPN won an emmy for creating that superimposed yellow first down line representing the first down in football.  I can't believe it was only that year that they did it.  They have done it since.
Yeah I think it happened in 1997 or 1998. i think that was the first part of it. i remember watching games with it on.
I do, a little bit.  Winning an emmy for the innovative one was very innovative.
Yeah it seems like it, I think there are other categories they could have used for. do you know what the highest score game of football was?
222-0? I assume the rules of that game were a bit different then, but I would assume therules were the same. That must have been a boring game.
Yeah good call I would agree with that. I wonder why they stood for that play, sounds like it was a touchdown with no defense and a touchdown without a play.
I find it boring that the average nfl game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay. I wonder why that is. I would find that a little part of me is ok with it since an average nFl game only has 11 minutes or so of live play.
Yeah, and with all the breaks and stopages, I can see why.  I do like to go to some games and watch live though.  Do you watch much tv?
I had no idea the NFL uses tracking chips on the players to record every move on the field.  That's really high tech.
Yeah they are tracking stuff a lot.  They are tracking hits to the head, head, and the helmets too.  I wonder if they are also tracking hits on the helmets?
Yes.  I saw in the article that there is a variation of soccer where 3 teams face off at the same time, the line is the same but on the other side of the line, and two teams face each other at the time.  That would be fun to watch.
That is pretty wild!  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good day.  It's been nice talking to you!
Hi!  Hope today is a good discussion about football and religion.  In most cases these can be merged, but in some cases they are not.
It is a bit ridiculous to try and stay relevant to your spirituality through football. Brady seems to be trying to stay relevant in his spirituality.
I honestly scoffed at how absurd that statement was. I mean, he even said sports might bring people closer to their religion, and Daniel Wann, who honestly scoffing at how ridiculous that was, said sports are a religion, not just for people like him.
I think the idea of sports is that they make people more divisive.  Crazy how bitter and competitive people are about their teams.  They make people less divisive and more bitter.
I agree with Bob Ryan, in his articles.  I'm skeptical about some of the articles.
People are more apt to follow Brady when he is winning than when he's losing.
I doubt it, people will follow him like religion, it is funny when he does well, people want to believe that, but if he does poorly, people don't.
Well, it's not like he'll play anymore, it was in a setting where he was going to be in some sort of cult orMLM stuff so maybe he finally got out of that sort ofcult.
I think it could be, but I don't know to be honest with you. I really enjoy learning about cults. I also like to read the NFL, I enjoy learning how interesting it is and I read the nfl actually has no rule against female players, that is pretty cool, I'm surprised there is no rule.
That is suprising. Male dominated the sport has always been suprising though.
Honestly, yeah I would get pretty riled up lol. I wonder what you think of girls being allowed into boy scouts, honestly. And yeah, they're still required to read from the bible and all that.
I didn't know that.  I wonder if it was because it is the most commonly read and easily accessible book in their reading curriculum, or if it would be a challenging read that is not commonly used in theirReading curriculum.
I never forced it in my classes in high school, but I think I should have forced it, since it was optional.. I read that iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely pink, and it is cracked up about.  The visiting locker room is completely Pink!
Iowa must be really into razzing other players from opposite teams.
Honestly I can't see how that would go over well in the US
I know they have a huge rivalry between the two main Iowa colleges - Hawkeyes and Vikings. Not as big of a rivalry as the two teams are in the U.S., but still a huge one. I am a Hawkeye fan myself and as bad as packers and vikings fans are at, I don't think the rivalry is as bad
Ahh... Alabama... I know right?  Did you know that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live game-play?  An average NFL games only has about 11 minutes and 17 seconds of live play.
Yes. The rest of the time is spent on huddles and waiting for the snap. I wonder how much action time there is in other forms of football.
Yeah,  yeah that seems like a waste of their time.  kinda silly.  I wonder how much time they actually use.
I wonder if the Cumberland game was the one that set the high score record at the time, that was the Cumberlands game of all time
What was the name of that Cumberland game?
Cumberland Completely whupped Georgia back in the beginning of the 18th century. 222-0 to be more specific, but I'll give you a point at this point, Cumberland completely whupping Georgia back then. I wonder how they did that, do you know?
Crazy! Anyway, great conversation!
Nice chat!  Thank you as well.
Bradys things are getting amazing! Football and avocado ice cream are not in order but avocado icecream is. It is good with almonds!
Yes I do like football, football and the renowned Tom Brady. I am fascinated by him and his religion.
I had heard about that, it's amazing! I think he has a best selling book called "An Athletes Bible" it's his spiritual quest. It's amazing.
I am surprised at how much football fans get into religion, but I guess they get into the sport for the sport.  Tom Brady has a near-religious devotion, like Chris Beneke.  I am surprised that most football fans don't consider that religion.
Interesting! I will have to check it out. I'm interested in finding out more about the series Tom Vs time, Tom vs Time and his life. I might have to look it up after this.
Ha.  speaking of football, I recently learned that the locker room for visiting football teams at the University of Iowa is painted pink.  Can you imagine what that's like?  Can't imagine.
Haha that is hilarious, I wonder if that is just because visiting teams face each other in the locker room haha.
I agree, it must be demoralizing to walk into a room painted pink,
Speaking of schools Georgia Tech doesn't wear pink, it's so offensive that they stand behind a stand up joke about not wearing macho!  Speaking of schools georgia tech once defeated cumberland by 222 to 0.  I was thinking about the highest score ever at one point.  Cumberland had a high score of 222 to zero! That was when they were thinking, macho, machismo!
Let's talk about football without mentioning the NFL. The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay. I know it's broadcast but it's only because it's on the broadcast and not actual on the actual running.
I did not know that, I also found out that the superimposed yellow line, the one with the idea of where the first down line is, won an emmy once but I have no idea what it was for
That is fascinating! I wonder if they still play football in a few years or not.  The lifetime earnings of engineers are higher than NFL players.  I wonder why.  They can play football and still earn more, but the lifetime earnings are much higher.
That is true, but in other countries there are variations of football codes such as soccer which soccer pays better, and MLB and NFL are just variations of Footballs,
Yes, there are so many variations of football is confusing. The australia version of football  is rugby football.
I dont really know what you mean by football in that sense.  I dont know anything about it.  My father in law and my husband both think the regular season is nuts with 16 weeks running from September to December.  It makes no sense.I think it is nuts that there are 32 weeks running, but I dont think the players know what they are doing.
Yes. I thought that professional athletes made a lot more, and they do, but not the top bowlers, and I thought at one point that the top football stars (and continuing up until the 1960s and 70s, top bowler) made a much more. I would have thought thatprofessional athletes made more, but I am not sure.
That's crazy! I don't think Brady makes much, he's won so many superbowls though.  He's a messiah figure to a lot of patriot fans.  They say he's even won 4 Superbowls.
I don't know, but I remember that engineers make more than Tom Brady in their lifetimes.  I remember in the 50's, half a century ago, a bowler would make twice as much as him.  Did you know that a bowLER would make more in theirlifetimes?
I worry that he doubles his salary because of that mega super model Gisele Bundchen.
The NFL is a gender inclusive sport, though!  Women are allowed to play if they meet the league's skill requirements.
Nooo but awesome! that is really cool!  I would like to see females play but honestly I am scared of the rough players and the body of the big, fast field.  It is a fast field and I don't want to be scared of them,  nooo but great!  Anyway its been a fun chat,  have a good night!  and I will let you know if any females play!
I agree, it will be a challenge for a female to play it professionally, with all the concussions gained from football and all, and the concussed, I would think so too.  Good night and I agree, I think it would be a good night as well.
I agree.  I will keep my fingers crossed for that.  Have a good night!
Hi! Tom Brady created a new lifestyle routine called "method" method. It basically includes " mantras", dieting, personal training, and encouragement that includes "the Tom Brady Way" of dieting
Yes, I heard of that, but I don't know much about it. Is there a book about it?
Yes it is, it's basically Tom Brady's "The Game of Football", it's like a kind of spiritualism based on the game, but from the start.
I don't know how that works, but I heard about it in a documentary series, I think its great, I wonder if it is in the works?
That doco series pretty much just talks about his journey with his philosophy, discovery and how he talks about it. It's a journey he has taken in his own right
I watched the first two episodes on January 11th and 12th of this year, but haven't watched the third yet.  I thought they were good.  It is focused on his physical and mental preparation.
I wondered if the doco series would be more about his physical preparation or his mental state over time. Professional sports take a toll on you, and I think the docos talk about his mental condition better than his physical prepares.
yeah, they will talk about it more. I think he has a much better outlook on his life now.
That's cool.  Belichick is a coach who is very cool. He has the type of charisma and charm that Brady does.  I think that's why people like his statement about the spirit of the game and I agree with that statement.  It's why he is the best coach.
I do agree with that statement, I think the fans have too much faith in Belichick and his charisma and in Bill We Trust, and creed and such to not agree with him, but I do agree that the fans are right, they have faith in Bill we trust,
I agree. Ultimately the coach can make or break a team. I have to agree with the patriots that fans have a religious devotion to him. I think it is balanced in my opinion since they have never complained about him. They know that ultimately the coach is the only one that can make a team balanced.
I feel like the Patriots are getting more accomplished, but not as much as I would like to see.
I dont know, I dont really know. I dont know if it isnt because they are a good team. I feel like a lot of the teams are just devoted to a good football team.  It has been talked about in church that a lot, but football teams need that kind of devotion.
I don't agree with the retired columnist Bob Ryan, he feels like Brady is a spiritual figure.  He feels like he's promoting a "fitness" bit, and not a "spiritual" bit.  I think good nutrition and fitness is fine, and I agree with him, but promoting a spiritual one?  I don't think Brady is very good at that.
I know people say he is a spiritual leader but I dont think that is fair to say that. I would think that the Patriots would have had a great comeback in the Super Bowl and I would give the credit just Brady and the way he brought it back, but people want to credit just brady for doing the sort of thing, he has a great way of doing it and the Patriots did have a great come back, I dont know if I would have done that in the SB but it is the Super bowl so I think he is the spiritual leader of the team,
I think it takes a team.
Yes it does.  But it takes team work.  The highest score in football was in 1916 when Georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0.
Absolutely!  I wonder if that team was so bad that they were painting their locker room pink like University of Iowa did!  That way, the other team would be intimidated or something.
It's impossible to do, though. Benjarvus has never had a fumble, and the Patriots QB has never even had a turnover in his entire career playing for them. I wonder if that is why he never had one.
Wow that seems impossible. In the 1960's bowlers made twice as much as football players.
Yep, I don't think so.  I think that takes into account the word football talks about the games not the games themselves, like soccer.  American football, but soccer.
Yeah, I know.  Do you like it?
Yep.  Football is a game with a lot of meaning and history and you can see that in the game itself.
Hey there.  Did you ever read a book by Tom Brady?  He has a method to his method.
I have not read his book but would like to find out more about it.
It's worth a read, its basically his strategy of being successful, hes already tied for the superbowl record and I think hes going to be the one that will be successful.
It is pretty amazing. Are you a fan of football?
Yes, I do like football. I follow a team for the big games and sometimes follow a few other teams. How about you?
I am a Bears fan, so I can imagine you, I am watching a game or two every now and then.  Were you aware that ESPN won an Emmy for creating the yellow first down line for the marks on the line of scrimmage?  I can't imagine watching without it.  It gives the first down position.
That is a great inventino, worth it for sure. I would love to see that. I like the way one team painted the other sides locker room pink. The record improved and the other team's record improved.
I've heard about it.  I think it's a mind game.  Do you know the University of Iowa?
Haha I'm not sure.  I think it was.  But I don't think they have ever fubmled the ball like Benjarvus Green-Ellis, he's the only player to have ever done that haha
That is amazing! I was not aware of a player that has never fumbled a ball! I wonder what team he is on? I wonder if they recognize his name or if they are aware of the player, amazing!
The Patriots!  I think bowling was super popular in the 60's and he was super good at it.
I do remember it being very popular, but I don't remember it getting so popular.
Yup, and it made more than the football players back then, that's nuts!
Wow. I did not know that. Did you know that the NFL has no written rules against female players? I wonder how that will happen since the NFL does not have any written rules.
Interesting. I think women would be able to run quick but probably not be able too well since they have lower muscle mass. I wonder if it would coul dhave a female kicker? They coul have a female kicker because of the lower musclemass, but I think the women would have to run quicker.
If they can run fast enough to pass requirements then they can probably be good at the kicker.  The kicker is a huge position so that would be a huge way for them to play it.  I think it would be the pass requirements that would allow them to be good.
For instance, in 1968 top womens tennis players were beaten by high school students.  I wonder if they would have the same problems if they had to cna pass the requirements of the Olympics and keep the Mens and the Women's divisions in the Olympic games separate.  The top women's Tennis players were beat by highschool students.
The NFL uses the tracking chips in players shoulder pads, footballs, and tracking chips  in players head.
Directino says they can track all kinds of stats like speed, acceleration and rotation. I hope they can use that information to help prevent concussions.
I hope so, too.  I don't think they will be relying on reviews though, they will use the data to help make calls and use it to make calls.
I agree, I think they could use chips to track that stuff.  I wonder if the refs can use it to be impartial too, they use a bible btw, so they have to be unbiased, I wonder why the ref's use the Bible btw
I don't have a real opinion on it, but I think it's good and bad.
Do you like football? I'm a huge Tom Brady fan. People seem to like him so much. I'm not sure what religion he is though, apparently it goes against his religion like some people do.
Yes I do like it. I didn't know he was a book author.
Yeah, he calls it the athlete's bible, I feel like that name is offensive and I feel that name could be offensive to many
Yes, I heard about that.  I think it's for a documentary series, Tom vs Time, or something like that.
Yeah, I have not.  Is it spiritual or is it football?
I think it's not just about religion, he's also into the NFL too. Did you know women can play in the NFL?
No, I did not.  That's pretty cool.  I think the league is a pretty sexist organization.  It's not very enjoyable for a cheerleader, especially one who isn't a player in the league.  If a Saints cheerleader is already eating at a restaurant and a player comes in, she has to leave the restaurant, she's going to have to leave.  They are a pretty sexism organization.
That is strange, I wonder if that rule is outdated or not.  I also hear that the players use tracking chips, did you hear about that?
Yeah.  Technology has grown so much since then.  ESPN won an Emmy for the yellow first down line for the first game.  I think they are still using that.
True,  I'm glad they did.  I think that line has been around since 1930,  makes watching the game much easier.
Did you know a patriots running back never fumbled the football his entire career?
That is amazing!  Do you know the highest score in college football?
yeah it was a college game,  its a college one right?
Yeah Georgia Tech did it in 1916 in ata game against Cumberland
Yeah, I wonder if they did that for their guests?  Did you know that the visiting team locker room is painted pink at U of Iowa?  I wonder what guests think about that?
On another topic, do you know much about the Bible?
I'm not too much into it. I know that it used to be required for students to read in school, which I think is nuts.
I'm glad that's not the case anymore.  It was one of the most influential books in history.  I wonder if it was one that was one one the most popular and influential books ever.
It is very influential. Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams did not use a Bible at their swearing in. They used the bible at their swore in, Teddy Roosevelt at first.
Good point! I didn't know that. I also didn't that Jefferson created his own version of the Bible. I wonder if it was like supernatural stuff, or just his version?
Ultimately, it seems silly to carve out the stuff about miracles and resurrections, but I can see the reason for it.  I think most of the stuff in the story relates to something that was included in the whole story, and the reason why, but ultimately, it still relates to the stuff we have now.  It just seems sillyto carve out all the stuff that is not in the overall story.
Do you watch the NFL?
I do, do you have a favorite team or player?
I love the Patriot and Tom is amazing.
I do, that guys is awesome. did you hear he is a book author too?
Yeah I heard he wrote that book "The Athelete's Bible" and it's a method to using for using the athelete's bible, I think I read that one, what do you think about that book
I think I read that book, but I will have to watch the documentary first before I read it.  I have not read thatBook either.  Have you ever seen it?
What is your favorite ice cream flavor?
I did not know that. I am surprised he eats very healthy most of the time. I wonder what avocado is his?
yup pretty much! Did you know women are allowed to play in the NFL?
That is pretty cool! I hope that there is some written rule that they can actually take to the field!
Yeah I hope so too. Engineers make more int heir lifetime than they do, about $120,000,000
Yeah that is a fact, and longer careers for them too, so longer careers.
Oh, that makes sense.  The NFL is using tracking chips in the players now, so I think that might be it.  Do you know how many tracking chips they have in the NFL?
I see they are collecting many stats, like velocity and rotation, and such,
Yeah. DO you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
Yes he played for the Patriots and never fumbled the ball in his career
yup pretty much. Do you know how the highest score recorded in a college football game was 222 to 0? It was in 1916
Yup that was 222-0 with Georgia Tech beating Cumberland
Yeah it was, ESPN won and Emmy for it
Yes it was for the superimposed yellow line and I think it deserved it
Yup. Do you know much about the bible?
Yes, I know Jefferson created his own version and he did not allow any supernatural parts of it, I wonder why he did that?
Yeah, he did, I swear he did. Same with Roosevelt and Quincy.
Are you a fan of football?
I do, who is your favorite team?
I am a bears fan, what about you?
I am a Steelers fans.  The Bears did pretty good the past season, but I am not one of the Pittsburgh Steelers fans that are so many.
Did you know that in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football players?  I wonder how much more top bowler's made than top football player, I would have to ask them.  What a stupid kick!
I did hear that, but I think that is unfair, sports make more now, like in the NFL, that is just unfair.
I am not positive about that, but that is just my case. I think it is positive. Do you know the highest score in ever a football game was 222 to 0.
222-0.  I think it was a high school football team in a college they played or sounds like it.  It was a High School football team, right?
That was in 1916 for Georgia tech against Cumberland.  The score was about 222 points in a game.  I don't think I ever saw a score like that one.
I'm not sure, laying low rank team, but I am a college football fan and if a college team scores over 200 points, I would think that the NFL would have a game with 100 points.  I can't believe that a collegeteam scores over 300 points in a game.  Is that like laying eggs for the NFL?
Wow! I didn't know that. I don't watch pro football, but I'm aware of college football. Speaking of college, were you aware that you can hear the team's locker room music when you're visiting the University of Iowa? It happened to the team locker room of the University at the University Of Iowa.
No, but I guess they did. They painted the guest locker room pink. Maybe because their opponents are girls?
I suppose so, it's a strange thing to say, do you remember the name Benjarvus Green-Ellis, I don't remember the first name, do You?
I don't remember him but I read that he never fumbled the football in his NFL career.
That is a pretty impressive stat, he played for the Patriots, right?
I think so.  He played in the superbowl, which is an impressive record.  I don't give the Rams any credit for that though.  They played in a superbowl.
They did have an impressive season and I thought they got all the marks for it, I can't imagine watching a game after the superbowl. Did you know that ESPN created the yellow line for first down marks because of that superbowl?
I know, ESPN did that at the beginning of football, that first down line.
Good question. I heard that the average amount of live gameplay in a game is only 11 minutes, so it's difficult for the viewer. The average amount for a game in a season is only 18 minutes, which is about the same average amount.
I was thinking it would be like three quarters but I think they should divide it up into two quarters.
I know right, I mean seems impossible.
Hello, do you watch the NFL?
I love the NFL.  I am a Patriots fan but my team is the Buffalo Bills.  Are you a Patriots or a Bills fan?
I'm not an NFL fan.  I used to be, but I don't anymore.  But, I used not to hate the Patriots as much as I do now.  They've been abandoned in the city they recent moved to.  Where do you live?
It is not that I would argue with Tom Brady's success, but I am not familiar with his method, so who makes up your method?
I have heard of it.  I have seen a documentary about it.
I have not, but I am curious to watch it. Brady describes the method as one that he got from the bible, but doesn't understand it. I am not sure how Brady describes it, but that's how I see it.
I agree, I think it is an interesting watch, I hate to say I don't give him credit for his career, but he has gotta have a method to be good this late in his career. I gotta give him that, it's the best method for him I agree, its been an interesting Watch.
Yep, winning is pretty impressive at 55 years old, and that is pretty crazy.  Crazy the technology we have these days, they put tracking chips in players uniforms and on the field after only a few years, and now they put trackers on players and in their uniforms after a few days.
Yeah that is nuts. I know they track the footballs, so I wonder how they get the data from that.
I wonder the same. The AAFL is using the app to also track the players movements. They added the yellow marker in the app for the league. Kind of an interesting new feature. They also telecast the game on the app, but only after the telecast. That is the way they added theyellow marker for the players.
Yeah, that would be interesting. It might make the game more interactive for the fans. I would be interested in seeing how much more they can do to make thegame more interactive. There's only 11 minutes of action in a game, so that would help.
I think I prefer football for the action. I can't believe there's only 11 minutes of action in an entire game. That's crazy to me. I'd compare it to hitting a record record score in a football game, and then hitting a score of 105 points in a soccer game. How is it possible to score that many points in an action sport like soccer? I don't think there's really a chance of that in a Football game.
Yeah,  soccer is constant but boring beyond belief lol I can't imagine a score that high in a game at this point,  you would think the cut offs would cut it off at some point.  Yeah,  can't believe a game would even be possible to imagine ascore that high!
Yep you would think so.  In the 1960s bowlers were making twice as much as football players in the league.  Impressive, but unheard of today.
Yeah, it definitely changed.  I guess we have changed but I guess some of the people in their lives have not changed. Engineers still earn more than the average football or MLB player, and most go back to school lol.  But, the average QB still doesn't earn as much as the average baseball or MLBplayer.  Maybe it's because of the engineers?
Yep, I would like to go back for engineering, but I stopped doing it.  I tried to incorporate the book as part of regular education, like bible study, but it didn't go over so well.  So I have stopped.  Maybe I can incorporate the Book as part as partof a bible study.
Yeah, I wonder how they did that. Maybe they should teach Thomas Jefferson's version, he cut out the best parts with a razor and used it to cut out all the razor's from the thomas jefferson version
That's an interesting approach.  I wonder if Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams were sworn in on a bible like Thomas Jefferson.  Teddy Roosevelt did and he used a bible.
Yes, I wish that was still an option. Did you know malus is the name of the apple and evil is the option?
I didn't know that either!  I did learn the other day that if you hung them on your mind they are allowed to mean both.  Tom Brady has been in 8 Super Bowls, and only one has ever had a chance at winning.  I think some teams would like to keep him as a QB, he has hung with the best teams and has the best chance at win all day.
Yes, I agree, the man is 55 and it is time to step it up, he has done so much for us already.
Are you a fan of the NFL?
Yes, I'm a pretty big fan. It's tough to be in the AAF league, is it?
Yeah I watch it from time to time.  Did you know women can play as well?
Interesting, I guess. I wonder how the New Orleans Saints would deal with that. It must be tough for the cheerleaders to have to compete physically against the players. I guess that's why the rule is that there is no rule against it. I would wonder how they would deal if they were in the same restaurant as the players, or if they had to compete with them.
I think that is the worst part, I wonder if they have to leave mid meal if a player walks in. What is the rule about if they leave and a player comes in? What if they are already there and aPlayer walks in?
I wonder what caused that?  I mean it makes sense if all this fraternization was frowned upon before.  I think it's caused them to invest more time in their off-field and it's probably caused them not to want the players to be around each other.  They even created chips that track their on-field movement.  It makes sense they would have created chips for this.
I hope the data they are collecting will help make the game a little bit safer.  They are collecting everything they can on the field and off, so hopefully they can use it to make thegame a little better.
It's amazing that there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in a game which averages out to be so damaging to players.  That is less than the 11 minutes in a football game which average out to 11 minutes and a game that only has 11 minutes  of actualGameplay.
That's a great point. The highest score recorded in a game was 222 to 0.
No, I do not but I am curious as to what it was, what was it?
I think it was 222-0 when Georgia tech beat Cumberland.
Wow! I've never heard of Cumberland. I wish they painted their locker room pink like Iowa did. That would give them a psychological edge.
Yeah thats a good point.  Do you think they have tracking chips in their players too?  I wonder what those tracking chips look like.
I was aware of that, but hadn't been aware of it before you mentioned it earlier.  I guess it is to track who is playing and how well they are doing.  It's interesting that engineers make more than football players, but football players have short careers.  Did you know that?  I think I mentioned that before.  But football players in the NFL make more.
Yeah, that explains it.  On another topic do you like the bible?  I think it's an old topic, I'm not sure I've ever used it.
I know a fair amount, mostly memorizing chapter and verse, and memorizing chapters as well as memorizingchapter and verse.  I guess that is why I was born in the late and reading the bible is no longer part of elementary school for some people, but it is for others.
Yeah that is interesting. It was pretty late that it was part of elementary education, I think it was in the 1950s, but yeah, I was prettylate too.
I guess it was.  I agree that some things are not considered supernatural.  President Thomas Jefferson knew that and made his own version of the Bible, made from a cut out of the version of it that he cut out from the Bible.  Do you think that President Thomas Jefferson knew that such things could be considered supernatural?
Yeah, I don't like that he didn't like miracles in the bible, the resurrection, the miracles, the bible...
I wonder if Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams had a personal version of the bible when they were sworn in.  Teddy Roosevelt was the first to do so.  I wonder if the two presidents used the standard bible that is used by most presidents when they are sworn in, or they used their own personal version.
Yeah good point, I bet he had a different version. Do you know that the tower of Babel is actually based on a place that exists? I wonder if it was based on the tower or the place that's exists now in our version
I have no idea where that is located, but it is probably in the Middle East.
It is located in the Eremenanki in what is modern day Iraq.
Interesting.  I like that the Bible was first translated into Latin in 50bc.  Some things we take for granted are not always what they seem.  Like the Apple.
Yeah and the word malus which coincidentally also translated to evil, is from the wordmalus which means evil
Do you like Tom Brady? I try not to equate football with religion, but he is Tom Brady.
Yeah, that is strange.
I think his method of promotion is a bit different and not the best way of promoting his book.  I wonder what he was trying to do with his method.
Yes, the book is a mix philosophy, nutrition, training, and training, but it doesn't really mix philosophy.
Maybe it's a celebrity thing. All of a sudden she becomes an expert on everything. People admire her and think she knows football better than anyone. I wonder if that's the case, though, because it seems like she's become an expert in almost everything except football.
Yeah, maybe it is, but it is a unifying thing, and I think he takes the right approach.
I think Tom Brady has a God complex, or a God Complex. He is so good and knows so much about football that he has an inflated opinion of the concept. I like him, but I don't think he is that good.
Yes, but he was so short when he started and only won the super bowl when he was just 18.  Miracle!
Good point!  It must have been difficult to get over that.  The city has a comically bad team and they don't watch much football.  They are a difficult city to get around.
As long as it's not Cumberland, I like it, they've been around since 1916 and only lost 0-222 to Georgia Tech
That is a good score! If I am on a losing team I give up football.  I will resume my "bible studies" and go to bible studies.  If I was on a winning team I would not have given up football for such a goodscore.
I would too. The old-ones like the old- Ones like the Apple 1st version, the supernatural-free of Thomas Jefferson.  You mentioned you like that version.
I read a book which talked about how the bible has changed slightly over the years and a number of times made big alterations. I believe the translations of translations of Translation are always different from the original.
Yeah, Thomas Jefferson cut out all of the miraculous parts of the bible, I wonder if that makes it better or not, maybe it makes it the more miraculous.
Did you know Roosevelt and Adams were the first presidents that did not allow the bible to wear on their presidents? I wonder if there was an uproar because of that.
I think at that time freedom meant freedom.  I wonder how often a swearing ceremony is used?
I am curious if they used a razor or something like the Jefferson Bible. I haven't finished looking at the Jefferson bible, I'm sure I will once I'm finished with this.
I wonder how he cut words off of the pages? I know that's a very thick Bible. You could cut a side off of a thick bible, but if you cut words from one side of the Bible, it looked strange.
I wonder what method he used. Maybe using a razor to cut out the parts that mention football and religion?  I have a copy of the copy and it does not mention football.
I think I might buy one of those, I have a few pounds to lose before I am left, so I have to try it out!
Have a good day!  I'm going to go use Amazon!  Good day, goodbye!
Do you like Tom Brady? He thinks that the Athlete's Bible is an athletes bible.
I hadnt heard that before!
I think you are referring to coach Belichick, or Bill We Trust? Pat, is he referring to the sort of spiritual element?  I like Bill we trust, but he has a sort of spirituality element.
Belichick is good.  I'm a Packer fan, not a big fan of the Patriots, but a Packers fan.
I am a Chiefs fan.  I am not a fan of the spirituality thing either.  Pat's player Matthew Slater is an evangelist off the field.  They are adding another one, adding another Pat player Matthew Slater to their roster.  Is that a new one?  Is it another evangelist on the field?
He does seem spiritual.  I think he is having a lot of luck with that.
The Rams apparently have it going for them as well, although Brady shows no sign of quitting football, he is on the Rams apparently.
He isnt showing any signs of slowing down, he is 41 and isnt going anywhere.
Yeah. The NFL is making more than pro bowlers now unlike in the 60s.
I think that was a bad pay base for players back then.
Yep!  My alma mater beat Cumberland 222-0,  I am proud of that one.
I guess tech wanted to make sure they stayed in the game.
Yes.  Coaches can be hated by the Pat.  Speaking of which, did you know Benjarvus Ellis never fumbled once in his NFL career?  Coaching is hated.
That is amazing! I didn't know that!
I didn't realize that the NFL's average gameplay is only about 11 minutes, that seems low but it is so low
I heard about that.  I don't know how that is possible.  Is it really?
I heard that the NFL has a written rule that prohibits women from playing, but there is no written rule against them
No I didn't know that.
It's not uncommon for us to read from a bible in school, but it's not a religion like students back in the US used to. They used to use the Bible in school
The bible is considered the best selling book of all time, the bible is the bestselling book of the us,
Yes, I count myself among the free.  Thanks for the chat for the count.
Have you heard about Tom Brady's new book about his method?
I have not. I haven't read it, what is the book about?
Basically, it's Tom's Plan of Action. The book is a lifestyle book that talks about joy in life, good health, peak performance and the things that play part in his peak performance in life. It talks about Joy in Life, Tom's plan of action...it talks about the lifestyle and talks about Tom's plans for his life, it was a very well done book.
I am not a fan of QB Tom Brady, but I admire his accomplishment.
I am not familiar with Brady, but I heard a lot about him since the Patriots won the Super Bowl in 2016, right?
I'm not too familiar with him either, I like football, I think the NFL?
I am familiar with it, I like to go to live games and watch them play. How about you?
I like the NFL too. Do you have a favorite team? I like the 32 teams in the NFL
I like the Patriots. I have found that the NFL is divided into two, NFC and AFC. I like the winners, the winners are the Patriots!
I didn't know it was divided evenly!  Apparently, the NFL has no written rule against women football players.  There is no written Rule against women.
If they meet the league's eligibility requirements they can play as long as they are willing to play. The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of game play.
I found out recently that the players do not take the time to really use their time.
Mostly just making calls on plays and sometimes calculating yardage.  As a matter of trivia, do you know what the highest score of all time in a football game was?  The highest score ever, by calculating yardages, of course.
I heard of that game but can't remember which teams played it, I don't think they won in that game, but lost very badly. I can't even remember which team it was, but they must have lost very poorly.
Oh wow! I think they brought that back in 1916. Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland by 222 points! Wow, what a shame they had to let that go. Georgia tech defeated Cumberlands by 222 to 0.
I wonder if Cumberland's players were walking around the football field sleeping? There's no yellow line for the yellow line on the football Field.
I think ESPN is the one, and they won an Emmy for that strategy to superimpose that yellow line on the screen to mark the first down line, that's genius, they won a Emmy for the strategy
That is genius! I can't imagine any football field without that yellow line!
There have been a lot of innovations for football in the last century and a lot, but also a lot Of drawbacks. Like New Orleans saint cheerleaders have to leave if an NFL player comes into the restaurant, and they have to stay afterward if they are in the same restaurant as the nfl player.
That is an odd rule. The cheerleaders are still allowed to finish their meal if they already are in the restaurant, so they are allowed to finished their meal.
Well, I have to get going, nice chatting with you, have a good one.
Have you read Tom Brady's book?
No, I haven't.  What is it about?
Nope, and I don't plan to. apparently, quarterbacks will read that as a plan for life
He's actually got a football book about it, quarterbacking, it's about physical and mental awareness and prep.
It is.  Chopra Tom says that there is something greater than football.
I think he is on some kind of spiritual journey.  Maybe a zen type of book, a book about how to find the meaning of life and a zon type ofbook.
It requires you to look for the meaning of everything.  lol  I like the statement that "it is all about the meaning, not about playing football."  I watch it often when I am playing football.
My favorite team in the NFL is the Dallas Cowboys, they are the only one to reach the Super Bowl in the NFC so far.  I think that we may get another one one day soon.  Who's your favorite team by the way?
I like many teams, but mine are the Green Bay Packers and the other two teams that I like the most.
Nice, that's my favorite sport. I watch those games for 3 hours and they only have 11 minutes of actual gameplay. I can't watch thoseGames!
I'm sure you are watching a lot of commercials.  Maybe they should start putting tracking chips in the players padding.
That's a good idea.  It will help with concussion issues and help quarterbacking by tracking rotation and ball speed.
Yeah they have so much technology now and they have a good reason. Do you ever read the Bible?
No, I don't. I know that it is the best-selling book in existence, but I have never read it.
Yes, I think it is. Thomas Jefferson even used a razor to remove as much of the supernatural as aspects of the resurrection and miracles. It is so influential that it has over 4 million billion copies. Probably the most of any time.
Teddy Roosevelt did not swear in with a bible when he was inauguration as president, and he was required by law apparently.  He and others that were inaugurated as president did not have to swear in using a bible.
Yeah I heard about that and was aware. I also heard that John Quincy Adams was the one who came up with the name for Babel's tower, the real name of the building was the Babel Tower. It was actually a real one in the modern day Iraq.
That would make sense, it is in a region where the bible was written, that would make the most sense
True.  The Bible is considered to be the inspired word of God.
I wonder if people will treat Tom Brady's book as reverently as the Bible?  I know that he's been called the best QB ever, but I wonder if in years people will treated him like he was Tom vs time.  He's made the most of his time in the NFL and made it to the Superbowl so maybe people will treats him like Tom vs Time, or as they called him in the Bible.
Hey, if the center of civilization hasn't come a long way since then, I'm not sure what the book will look like in a long time. Nice chatting with you friend.
Hi, do you like religion and football? Do you see the similarities?
I don't know, it's hard to say. I don't find similarity, but I find similarity
I guess I respect Bradys opinion on the matter. He is a great player and has done a good job for the sport so I guess I Respect His opinion.
Yeah apparently bravado ice cream is a secret.
No I have not but I am going to start looking into it now. I think it would be great if it could boost my athletic capabilities.
As far as religion goes Brady has made football what it is.
Yes he does. He seems to eat football, eat football and sleep football. He must breathe football. His determination is so strong.  His success with the Patriots is proof.
I agree, he's like the Messiah, with all his accomplishments and I think he is the new Messiah,
What are your views on Bill Belichick? Some fans think that his views have been exaggerated, but some fans don't think so.
I think Brady is just a friend at a certain level, but not the son of Deepak Chopra.
I have no clue, I find interesting how ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the yellow first down line, I had no clue that was even a line
I love that line. Haha! Hey, did you know Jefferson created his own version of the Bible? I wonder if it was a better version than the one Jefferson created in the Bible.
No, I didnt, I wonder if they were similar to the original one?
I believe so. Apparently he cut out all the parts about miracles, resurrection and supernatural events with a razor.
Well he was trying to get a part of the Bible that he didnt agree with.
He said that there were other important parts of the book.  It is kind of weird.  I would have bought a non-fiction book for sure.
Yeah,  yeah,  reading a non fiction book and leaving that poor bible as a fiction book you shouldnt,  I dont agree with him,  but I dont know,  you can always try another book,  if you dont agree,  just keep reading the same book and leave it there.
Hey that is funny, did you know that all presidents have used the Bible at their swearing in and swearing in?
I bet they werent religious enough.  I wonder if it cost them votes.  Presidents are not always the way they seem, I bet they are, I wonder what it cost the us.
Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams, I think.  They both made a promise to keep the constitution.  Teddy Roosevelt and john quincy adams, I believe.
That would be an interesting thing to google later.
Hello, do you like the Bible?
I know a little about football. Do you?
Not at all. Did you know that it is not uncommon for american students to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education?
Did you know that Tom Brady is the QB for the Patriots?
I'm not sure who I like more, the Patriots or Tom Brady? Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible, cutting out the supernatural parts, like the resurrection and the miracles and the resurrection of the supernatural, by cutting the first two miracles out of the bible
No, I didn't know that. Teddy roosevelt and john adams did not use a bible for swearing in ceremonies.
Jefferson wanted to keep his religion in humanist terms.  He swore in as a humanist.  Maybe he felt that the government was for people and we owed allegiance to them.  I think he felt the government should be a religion in Humanist terms like the constitution.
Interesting!  The word apple in latin is malus, which means apple.  The first word for apple in Latin is Malus.
That is an interesting coincidence.
Did you know there are no rules against women playing in the NFL? I wonder if the NFL will ever have rules against that.
That's great!  I wonder if women will ever get on the team or if it will ever be a team of their own?
I know!  It would be interesting to watch!  The game only has 11 minutes of live tv and they play on average for a game, so that means there is no time to eat, or footall, or get treats, or anything.    lol   I would rather be standing in the line at the stadium.  lol
I would rather watch the game, or at least the highlights.  I figure that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than an NFL player.  But, I wonder why the average Lifetime earnings of a engineer areHigher than an nfl player.
That makes sense and is surprising to me, but also makes sense since the average player is less than the averagePlayer of the New Orleans Saints. Do you watch them?
I don't watch their games, but I know they're good. Are you?
I'm thinking their cheerleaders are a problem though. They have to leave the restaurant if a player comes in. I was thinking their Cheerleaders would be the problem.
True, sexist thinking.  What a date.
I think the tracking chips in balls and shoulder pads is a great idea.
Yes I think so, to prevent injury I think.
Benjarvus Green-Ellis is a great player, only one player to ever fumble the ball
That is a great player!  I would like that award.  Maybe a bonus or something for being such a greatplayer.
I agree, he should be recognized for it, he has been great. Anyway, great chat, thanks for being recognized!
Great chat with you as well!  Have a cat!
Have a great day!  I will.
Do you like footbal?
I do. DO you like Tom Brady?
I love Tom Brady, he is the best player in the NFL histoy in my opinion, what do you think?
I know he plays football and also has a religion, he has a book called "The Athlete's Bible" which is about his religion. I wonder if he uses it when he plays?
That sounds a bit disgusting, he should eat that book, he says part of his success is due to eating avocado ice cream, sounds like he is trying to say success isdue to eating it!
That is gross. I think that is why he is so focused on his life, he is not going to let anything get to him.
Yeah, he is. He is at the top of his game. He knows the game well.
I think Brady is a kind of messiah figure for Patriots fans.  He is like his own kind of Messiah figure for patriots fans.
Yes.  He has lead the team to 8 Superbowls.
Brady's commitment to the method is sincere. He works hard and his method is sincerity.
Well, success on the Patiots isnt due to good luck, you have to work hard, its about hard work. Who is your favorite team?
I'm a Broncos fan.  I like Patriots RB Green-Ellis.  He is married to a Broncos player and he has never fumbled once in his NFL career.
I did not know he holded that record, I loved to watch him play but didnt know he was the only one in the history of the NFL and also of the Be in the NFL, I wonder if he is still in the nba now
I didn't realize he was the only one, did you realize he did that with 3 teams?
Yeah, i didn't know that either.  What division do you think the best teams are in?
Oh that makes sense. I read that the average game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay. I don't even know how much I could get in.
I guess ads take up a lot of the time during the 11 minutes of game play, so I guess ads are the only way to get through the other 15 minutes of gameplay.
The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earned by an NFL player and an engineer.
I wonder why? Engineers tend to work for a longer time, and football players have shorter carreers so maybe engineers have shorter time as well.
That's what I was thinking.  I also wonder how they do not know that cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restrausnt as any NFL player and even the same cheerleaders  are forbidden in other restraunt.
That is such an aweful rule. I guess that is no good reason.
Hi!  Do you watch the NFL?
Hey there I do, I do!  Who's your favorite team?
Yeah I love Tom Brady the guys are a legend, what about you?
Agreed. He is also a book author.
I did hear about that, his book is called "The Athlete's Bible", it is about his method, I think it is a book, but I am not sure.
Yeah, I've read it and heard of it but never read it, I saw a documentary featuring it though.
That would be interesting.  What is your favorite ice cream flavor?
I don't, but I guess it makes sense since its avocado, which is healthy, so I guess that's one.
Yeah, I wonder if women can play in the NFL?  Did you know women can played in the nfl?
Yeah as long as they meet the requirements they can
I do not think so. In a lifetime engineers make more than twice as much as they do.
Yeah apparently I guess I did know that, but yeah apparently I'm not sure why. I guess it makes sense if you have a longer career.
I heard NFL is implanting chips into the player's pads.  I wonder what those are for?
Yes they are collecting stuff like velocity and rotation and such
Yes. Do you know who BenJarvus Green-Ellis is?
Yup he is a RB who never fumbled the ball in his career which is amazing
That is amazing! The highest ever score in a game is 222 to 0. The hsitory is the highest score ever in a
Yeah that was Gerogia tech crushing Cumberland 222-0
Yup, ESPN won an Emmy for that.
Yeah it was for the superimposed yellow line, pretty cool
Yes. Do you know much about the Bible?
Not much, but I know that it has sold over 7.5 billion copies wow, that is a ton, I know it has been sold over 6 billion copies.
Yeah and one of the most influential books in history, one of only two most influential Books in history!
Hi, are you a football fan?
I watch it from time to time.  Do you have a favorite player or team?
i watch some but I dont have a favorite player. who is your favorite player?
Tom Brady is so famous, he is about to release a new docuseries called "Tom vs. Time" I heard about it, it will be a Tom Brady vs. the Time release, I wonder if it will have a docusery called about how he became famous.
I havent seen it. I heard about it, but I haven't seen it either.
It is broadcasted on Facebook and it is a feature of Facebook. A lot of people on the facebook watch it.
I do use it regularly, I think Ill catch some stuff on there, but I've never used it regularly.  I've heard of the method though, its like religion or something.  How do you use it?
Yeah people invest a lot of hope in him.  He is a patriot coach, a creed called "In Bill we trust", he is the coach of a team.  A team with a creed like "InBill We Trust".
I love that.  There is a raggamuffin that they use to describe him.  He doesnt have Brady's charisma.  I think he is just a riffamuffins.
Haha, I think he is a raggamuffin, but not enough to warrant that nickname.
He had some kind of unkempt, sloppy looking fashion sense, maybe?
I know what you mean! Bill was hoping the camera would not be able to focus on his fashion style in the eleven minutes of live gameplay!
That is crazy, considering the games go on for hours!
Yeah, I don't even know if I could devote an entire afternoon to watch the game, let alone a whole day. I am a couch potato, and I wish games were longer than eleven minutes.
I live on a couch and that's where I'm going to be if that is the case.
It's hard to believe that there's only eleven minutes of gameplay.  I know that bowlers back in the day made more than NFL players.  If that exists today, they would earn millions.  NFL players only earn $9.95 and bowlers only $6.50 for eleven minutes, but they could earn millions if the game existed.
True.  It is so popular, they make so much more.  I can't believe bowling is still making more than they are.
Yeah, I can't imagine sports companies that used to make any bowling clothes for the professional still exist.  I mean, you wouldn't see them endorse anything, so I can imagine sportsCompanies don't make any Bowling clothes.
True.  I know that there has never been a professional bowler in the past or present.
Football games are broadcasted and Super Bowl is held first Sunday in February. All the football games are Broadcasted on Sunday.
I know some popular tv shows dont want to compete with those.  Great chatting with you, have a great day.  I have to get to the tv.  It's time to compete, now!  I think the popular TV shows dont like each other.
Howdy!  are you a fan of football at all?
Yeah I love it.  What do you think of Tom Brady?
I can't say I like him.  I think he has his accomplishments on the field of play but there is no denying his brilliance off the field.
Yeah he apparently has book called The Athletes Bible, have you seen it?
I didn't read it.  Did you hear of it?  It's a method of pursuing high performance.
I haven't, but it looks like he has his own kind of cultist/cultist fans that call him the messiah of the people.
Yes, he's one of the best. He's so dedicated to performing at the highest level. I can't imagine any other person, at any level, being dedicated to being that good of a person, to playing to the highest of their level. He must have a head on his shoulders and a head in his head to play the game at that level and then go on to play at the best of his level and shows it in his book and on the tv shows and on TV. He is like Half of Boston, dedicated to performances and on top form.
Yeah I agree he subscribes to avocado ice cream for sure, evre he also subscribes for sure!
No, I haven't but I would be interested in trying it. I'm giving up mine. I just read a quote from Brady which read "If I were given a mission, I would give up my life and compete to help others." I admire the way he has made it his mission to be dedicated to that mission, and I'm glad he has done it. It made me admire him even more.
Yeah, that is dedication.  Apparently his plan is a method, not a method.  I think that is part of the life, but yeah, he is right about the dedication.
I believe it, living intentionally is the best way to do that.  If you dedicate yourself to a game you can dedicate a whole week to it.  The average game is only small with 11 minutes of playing time each week.  That's a lot of time for a lot in a little amount of time eachweek.  Bizaar has done a lot to prepare himself for this game and is used to a lot Of preparation for it.
I know, and it does pay off. Tom has made a whole lot of money. Chopra has his religion to thank for that.
He is focused on the game and shows no sign of quitting anytime soon. He will reach 30 NFL championships by then and is focused. He has never given up on thegame and showsNo sign of Quit
Tom vs. time? I'm not sure.
I have not. I heard about it. I think I might have to look it up on YouTube.
I don't think so, I think it's on Facebook. Do you use Facebook at all in your life ?
Did you know that the Univ of Iowa paint the visitor locker room pink?
I guess the coach thought it was an advantage? Kind of sad, but it's a joke right? The highest scored game was 220-0! I guess the Coach thought he had an advantage.
Good heavens, the other team scored like, how many points per minute? The average game is only 11 minutes and the otherteam's team scored 4 points perminute.
Yeah that's ridiculous.  I wonder if they had two teams back in the 1800s, Georgia Tech and Cumberland.
Nice chatting with you!  I have to go now.
Are you a fan of the NFL?
I used to love to watch football, not so much anymore, but I still love to watches it, what about you?
I cut cable a few years ago, I dont get to it as much.  I hear Tom Brady is really dominating right now, he is dominating since I hear he cut cable.
Yeah he has the ring.  He apparently has a regiment called the " Ring of Fire" method that includes avocado ice cream.
Avocado ice cream sounds like something he would do.  I don't know if I love or hate it, but I could see it working for him.  What about you?  Avocado icecream sounds like it's something you would love orhate.
Yeah I guess so. In the 60s a three time bowler made twice as much as top NFL players.
That's crazy, I wonder how much they pay them, it seems kinda high considering the fact there is only 11 minutes of game play and they have to pay them for that.
I think it is, I think that the sports player should be paid more.  They need the money to pay for universal health care, in my opinion.  If a sports player gets paid more, we should have enough money topay for universalhealth care
I agree, it makes me feel old, I know that the earnings for a football player over the life time are higher than for an engineer or a football players earnings but that makes me Feel old, like my earnings over the course of my life time is higher than that.
For sure, and they will still get millions over forty and then a few millions over fifty, but ten of those millions are probably going to be after retirement age.  lol
I think that I will take 20 years to make my millions.
Did you know that Iowa's states visiting locker room is painted pink.
I guess that's a nice intimidation tactic, I guess that wold be shocking if they did that all the time,
Yeah, at least at a subconscious level.  It is said that the highest scoring game of all time was 222 to 0.  I wonder how many words were used in the game.  Probably over 50.
Yeah that was in 1916, 222-0, what a blow out.
Yeah Georgia Tech must have been really hated after that, playing like that.  And on the bus ride home to Cumberland, they must have hated themselves on the whole bus ridehome.
Agreed! It was a rough game for both team.
I know right! On another note, do you use the Bible often?
I do not, but have been reading through some of the apps recently. It is interesting that Thomas Jefferson used a razor to make his own version of the bible, cutting out the supernatural parts with the razor. Nice chat!
That is so weird. I bought a fiction book about him once, I wonder what it is about.
Thanks, I think you're right.  I'll try to look it up and see if it's real.
I knew Brady was on a deep spiritual quest and was successful in writing a novel, I love how he is also a famous football player, I wish he was successful at being a QB.
He is a dominant force in football. He is hard to beat. He will be hard toBeat.
It is unbelievable that the Patriots are not favored to win again in Super Bowl LI, Ive seen that before, but the Patriots have been favored since the first Super Bowl.  Brady is so bad, they have to have avocado ice cream flavors to win ha,ha ha, ha.  Not sure how bad it is, but avocado is the best ice cream.
No I haven't tried that, but I have the avocado and guac, it is pretty good.
That's good. I don't know. I would make it with almonds. That makes it so much better.
Have you read his book?
No Ive never read it.  It's called "the athlete's bible."  I am not interested in taking a lot inside of his beautiful mind.  lol  I would rather read about his beautiful body.  He must be interested in take a lotinside of himself.
I am not sure what he calls his methods, but it seems like a very useful one.
Yes, meaning it has something to do with his successfull career and his secrets to a beautiful top model wife, money, and life.  He has loads of money now with kids and a beautiful wife and house that he bought with materials from his old secrets.  And a beautiful Top Model wife with loads of loads of wealth too with his loads of kids and the house he built himself.
Even when playing at the tip top level he was never winning.  He was never able to keep playing at a tip top levels.
That's interesting.  Did you know the NFL has a chip embedded in the footballs and the shoulder of the players to measure speed and distance?  It's one of the tracking numbers they use in the tracking number of the chip embedded on the football.
I wonder how fast it is used, I wonder if they fling him a ball when the ball is in his fling?
I knew it was eternal haha. My father in law used to say that the average NFL game is only 11 minutes of live game play. My husband said the average football game is about 18 minutes, but he's a father of two so I know he's not eternal haha
That is eternity!  I know that the quickest game in the world goes on for hours and only has 11 minutes of play, yet the quickest one in the US takes three hours and is only 11 minutes.
The NFL has a monopoly on players these days.  It is like they couldnt get enough players because they are all impatient.  But someday maybe there will be a female QB,  I am afraid Ill break the "monopoly" but it is too strong for football.  Its interesting that there is no written rule against a female quarterback in the NFL.  Maybe someday someday there will.  I couldnt see a rule against it.
I think that is a good thing as long as they dont treat cheerleaders the way they are treated and that is not a good things.
That's true. I heard that the New Orleans Saints have been terrible to the cheerleaders, apparantly cheerleaders have to leave if they come into a restaurant with the players and the players come in after. That's terrible! I wonder if that's true? I wonder why they do that? They have to be able to leave.
I dont know, I think that is a little overboard in my opinion.  I wonder what kind of incident would have prompted a rule like that.  Do you know?  I dont know if it is too overboard or not.
That happened so many times before I can't believe it happened again.  I wonder if they changed it since top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars in the 1960s.  Top bowlers making more than the starters back then!
That is crazy, that is great, good the pay it couldnt be that good then, but at the time it was great.  I know in the 60s engineers made way more, I wonder if bowlers were better, but engineers made twice as much?
The average lifetime earnings for the average engineers is higher than that of the average lifetime Earnings of the NFL player and MLB.  So the highest paid of the highest are the engineers, not the highest earners like soccer.
Hi, how are you? Do you like the Bible?
I know a little bit, I think it is interesting how religious books are similar. I know that the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint/New testament overlaps with the GreekSeptuag int and the Old Testament overlaps
I think it's not uncommon for american students to read from the Bible as part of their elementary education.  Back in the 1960s and 70s it was required for all students in the U.S. to read and understand the Bible.  Some of those ideas date all the way back to the Abrahamic tradition.  It's a little different now.  We have the Quran as partof our elementary education, and it's a very Abrahamic Tradition.
I was thinking that was a different society, but it makes sense.  It's so ingrained in our society now, it's become so ingrained that it's almost a way of thinking.  I know Teddy Roosevelt was one of the only two presidents to not swear in with a Bible.  Do you know why?
I think so.  I think John Quincy Adams was one.  He swore in on the Constitution and said he felt he was the only ones owed allegiance to the government and that the people were the ones who swore in.  But he said he was not a part of the government until 1805.
Ahhh... interesting.  That's a choice that doesn't seem good for people in power.  Thomas Jefferson had a razor and a razor to cut out parts of the Bible.  It was his own version of the version in the Bible...
He was probably a practical guy and wanted to keep religion in humanist terms.
That's interesting. I was shocked to find out that the Tower of Babel, based upon the Bible draws from real life building, the Etemenanki, and was shocked that the Bible drew from real Life building.
A lot of connections to the real world, linguistically.  Apple and evil are two words that have a lot of parallels.  The Bible was translated into Latin in the 4th century for a reason and the word for the word "mauls" was used when the bible was translatedinto Latin - mauls are actually mauling.  I wonder what that means?
Interesting. I thought it was so straight forward, but it's surprising the disagreements people disagree what parts of the bible are ok with and what are not. The Bible is so old it's not surprising the debates about it are sometimes quite surprising. I guess some people disagree about what's in the canon, and I guess they disagree what's included in it.
Some of our leaders have their political motivations, or beliefs. Like the case of Jefferson.  I wonder if his beliefs were for or against the Bible.
To be fair, some people have considered it interesting that it is technically the best-selling book of all time and has sold over 5 billion copies. I don't know how many people buy it, but it's clear it was not one of the bestsellers, even if it is one of 1 billion copies, so it's not like people don't buy it.
I wonder what controversy there was in the book that got it chosen as the best book?  Was there some controversy about who was left out of the chosen?
Yeah that is true. Speaking of controversy, did you know that the NFL will sometimes leave a restaurant and players will come in while the cheerleaders are eating in the same restaurant and player have to leave? That's terrible and it's true, I don't like it, especially when it's the NFL.
That is shameful how the women in the NFL get treated, they are like class citizens, like they are class citizens.
It is surprising female players are technically allowed, in a time that makes no sense.
I think it is for the best in the long run, no more concussions and more engineers in the short run.
True! I think that's why engineers make much higher lifetime earnings than NFL players, on average. MLB players only make an average of $7,500,000, but engineers make more and even have higher lifetime Earnings than NFL Players.
I would not be surprised if they did. NFL players have short careers though, due to injury and age. Well, I enjoyed chatting!
That's not surprising considering there is only 11 minutes of actual live play every game.
That is true, but those 11 minutes stretched over hours is still 11 minutes stretching over hours!
Not at all. Well it's been nice chatting with you, have a good night!
Do you like Tom Brady? I like him, but I also like avocado ice cream.
No, I don't, but he is keeping himself on top of his game.
It's weird that depak chopra's son gotham and his son were friends and he let him pass on the pass, it sounds disgusting. I didn't even realize that he was friends with him, weird that DePaul Chopra's daughter was friends of his.
I would love to read his book, it's called an athlete bible, do you like it?
I am reading about it now! I would like to see the Saints stop that insane rule that they have in demand of their cheerleaders that if they leave a restaurant and an NFL player comes in, they have to leave as well. I wish we could see the NFL player have to stop that.
That is wrong, it makes me mad just thinking about it.  Women can play in the nfl too, so that makes me even mad just think about it, women can play!
As long as they meet the eligibility requirements.
ESPN created the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line.
They did? I wonder if they won an Emmy for that? They had an awful year in 2013, they had an amazing year and then an awful one
I think Cumberland did well in 1916.
I like Cumberland, what about you?
I hit enter before finishing.  Cumberland got 222 points.  I quit playing that game before I got to like 100 points.
I would have too.  I've been to a few high school games.  Coaches stop it at least once at the Georgia Tech game in my high school.
I don't know why, maybe they wanted to keep the player from being a bowler. I don't think I would have been a bowlers player.
I have never watched pro bowling. engineers make more money than a player, do you know that?
I never knew that Green-Ellis had never fumbled the ball!
I don't know, but I know that the tracking chips on the balls register that they have and they know when they are used.
Thomas Jefferson is known for his miracles and the resurrection, but not so much for miracles as he was for the resurrection of the resurrection.
I wonder why, a lot of people don't believe in the bible, like Brady, he has a copy of the Bible.
I wonder if the bible is the best selling book ever?
Yes. DO you know what Tom Brady's bible is?
Yes, the Holy Bible.
Do you watch the NFL?
I do.  The NFC is the highest professional football league and one of three major sports leagues in north america, and the second highest in the world.  It is one of the four major sports teams in north America.
What kind of football like soccer do you like to watch?
Not really but I like to play them when I can.  Football can be referred as a team sports and it is referred to as the team play of the team in the place.
I like football, but not rugby or canadian football. I usually watch soccer, Rugby or Canadian football. What about you?
I don't have a favourite player is rugby, but I do like the game my favourite game my favorite game
I like Canadian football.  It's slightly modified by the NFL but it's also slightly modified.
Did you know the NFL regular season run from September to December?  They play 32 games in a season.  The 49ers play 14 games in the NFL's regular season.
Do you know how many games that is?
I would too!  Do you have a favourite team?
I like the Pats.  I think Tom Brady is super good.  Did you know he wrote a book about his method and how he got that way?  He used the method that he used and it worked.
Tom Brady of the New England Patriots?  He played top of the game at age 25.  He is the only QB to have ever played top in the game.
Yeah he is legendary.  The only Super Bowl that he has won in overtime is the one the Pats where losing.  That was in the SB.
On Oct. 11, 1895, was a sad day for Cumberland bulldog for losing the match with Georgia tech.
Yeah, I feel for them. I think that was a horrible game and a great game at the same time. How does one feel for being the losing team in a game like that.
I think if I had to work hard, it doesn't matter.  I don't think I would like it if I played for them, winning or loosing.  They are the best of the best and I wish I could work with them every time.
Yeah but losing 222-0, I feel like I am more proud of the 222-1, I can't feel sorry for them
That is shocking.  It was a game where we could not even move on from our mistakes.  We could not identify our mistakes and correct them after the game.
Yes, we can't forget about the loss of the game, a loss of 222 to 0!  It was by 222 points, but we can learn from the game.
I'm not sure, I don't think so.
I would forget the game if the 0-222 loss never happened.  I would go to the bar and think that I had never been there before and forget that 0- 222 loss never happens.
I would relax and think about how the team was improved and work hard to improve the game. I would think the team would be improved and Work hard to improved the game
Peace in the classroom! Did you know in the 50's student were required to read the bible? It was shocking to me.
I wonder if the Bible can help us to give more confident and God and human have more relation in each other, or just give more confidence and God
I wonder if Thomas Jefferson modified his own version of it, or if he just used the version that everyone else used.
It is based on a real building, the biblical tower of Babel, which is still around in modern Iraq but is based off the real building which is the Tower of Babel
Interesting! Have a nice day!
Hi! Do you watch the NFL?
Yes a lot, do you have a favorite team or player of theirs? or a favoriteteam?
I love the Patriots and Brady, he is a good and dedicated player.
I like them a lot.  Do you have a favorite ice cream flavor?
No but I know it is ice cream which fits into his healthy diet, he likes ice cream.
I think you are right. He wrote a book author about the sport.
He wrote the athelete's bible, it is a method, I've not read it, but I know he wrote the Athelete's Bible, it's a bible, what does it say?
I haven't, but I will have to watch it. I also want to watch the documentary series Tom vs. Time.
Yeah that sounds cool. Did you know U of Iowa painted their visitor locker room pink?
Yeah heard of that but not really sure how that works, do you know what the highest college football score ever was?
Yeah, Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0 in 1916.  I wonder how they did it?  That's quite a defeat.
That's a defeat that would take the cake for sure. Do you know why ESPN won an Emmy for that defeat?
I'm glad they did.  I wonder if it was for the superimposed yellow line?
Yes. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
Yeah he is a former Patriots RB for the Patriots, he never fumbled the ball in his career
Yeah he is a legend. Did you hear about the New Orleans cheer leader rule?
Yeah they are not allowed to eat at the same place at the right level, that is wrong, they should eat in the same spot and at the wrong level.
I have no idea, but I hate the fact that they have to leave mid meal if they want to and I hate when the players walk out
That is strange. On another topic do you know much about the bible?
I know its one of the most influential books, it has sold more than 4 billion copies and is one of most influentialBooks ever
Yeah, it is pretty powerful. It is also a part of the education system, so it is probably pretty powerful
Hello, do you watch the NFL?
I do! Do you have a favorite team or player?
I do have a favorite player, the Patriots and Brady.
I tooo. Did you know he is also a book author as well?
Yeah the wrote The Athlete's Bible and the method, I think I read that one, have you read it?
Yeah I have, there is a documentary on Facebook starring him about it.
Yeah Tom versus Time, I will watch that one. What is your favorite ice cream flavor?
I do not know that, but avocado makes sense for him.  The guy is very dedicated to his health.
Did you know women can play in the NFL too?
Yes they can for $1.65000 per year as long as they make the cut
I do not.  I do know that they are all engineers.  They are all from Penn State,  and one of them is from there.  He is one of their engineers.
I think that engineers make more money, so maybe they opt for that. Their careers are longer and they can opt for it.
Yeah and he plays a lot. Did you hear about tracking chips that are given to players?
Yes they are using ganes to help track rotations and velocity and a bunch of other stuff and they also use them to track rotation and velocity of the ganes
Yeah. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
Yes that is the guy who never fumbled the ball in his career, he's a legend, he was the guy that never fumbling the ball once in his whole career
Yes he is. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
Yes it was 222-0 from Georgia Tech. I feel bad for cumberland to lose 222- 0
Yeah, I wonder what was the name of that game? Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for that game.
Yes the yellow line that tells the first down makes game watching much easier, I am happy for them
Yeah it is. On another topic, do you know much about the bible?
I know some stuff. I know that it is one of the most influential books in history.
Yeah I know it has sold over 4 billion copies, that is a lot, I know I have sold about 2 billion copies of it.
It sure does. It's been nice chatting with you today.
Do you watch the NFL?
I do watch NFL games sometimes, how about you?
I do. Did you know the U of Iowa visitor locker room is pink?
I guess that is a way to make a statement to the visiting teams! I think I read about that somewhere!
Yes, do you know the highest score ever in a game was 222 to 0?
222-0 Georgia Tech vs Cumberland.  I have never heard of Cumberland, have you?
No I have not, what was the score? ESPN won an Emmy because of that score.
Yes, for the creation of the yellow line representing the first down in football
Yeah. Did you know women can play in the NFL too?
Yes, but I think 250-300 lbs men hitting smaller women is not going to make things any better.  I don't see 250- 300 lbs men hit smaller women.
Yeah that is a good point.  They should stick to engineering,  that is where the money is.  But yeah I think it would.  Maybe I will stick to Engineering for a while.
I agree.  I think the WNBA is great, but they need to work on their football.  The WNBA has a women's pro team called WNBA and there is also a women’s pro team Called WNFL.
Yeah that would be great. Do you think that the players have any trackers on them like the trackers they use on the players?
No, I did not know that.  That is invading their private lives in my opinion, I think it is a way to keep track of NFL players.
They are on the field to track their velocity and rotation on the Field. They are trying to make the game safer.
That would be good for the safety of the game.  The average NFL games only lasts 11 minutes.  So, I agree that the average NFL game is only 11 minutes!
That is pretty short yeah, I wonder how that ends, we are glued to the tv for hours on end for that, we must be glued for sure
The quarterback plays for only 11 minutes, divided into three, the running back plays for 7, kicks field goals for the other three.  Very short and yet the quarterback plays.
Yes, and they don't even account for the time when they are running out of time in those 11 minutes.  I think the quarterback is the only position that doesn't account for that.
hahahaha  If they are only on average on tv for eleven minutes just eat for the first 11 minutes just Eat for the last eleven minutes!  hahahaha
On another topic do you like the Bible?
Hi there! Are you an NFL fan? I am. Are you a football fan at all? I can't believe that back in the 60s pro bowlers actually made more money than pro football players, crazy huh?
That's crazy, I think they get paid pretty well today.
Yeah they are. Brady has a book out entitled "the athlete's bible"
In my opinion religion and sports dont mix well, he must make so much money.
I think religion is more about physical health, nutrition, mental preparation, and nutrition, not just religion.
That makes a little bit more sense.  And they are not just for the money.
Yes and his wife is a model. She makes more money off the field than he does. But she is an evangelist for her church. I don't know how religious people can be on a team like Matt slater. He is an Evangelist for his wife, but he makes more as a model than he makes as a player on the team.
Nice, these guys are all good Maral characters, some of the best athletes I've ever seen, and they seem to be able to get out of any off field trouble you hear about.  I think most athletes are just there to get in the off field help, but not always.  You always hear about that off field Trouble you hear of.
That is true.  Some fans treat them like deities, like Brady is a messiah and as a coach once said "Bill we trust is like a messianic messiah".  But, the fans treat him like a god, just like the deities.
I dont think he is mesiah, he isnt a football player, but that is just my opinion, I dont have a deep one, I could be wrong I love football and he is a football players, but he is not mesiah.
I find that hard to believe that there is only one.  I know it's a short game, btw.  The NFL game only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay in a game.  Do you find that's hard to think of?  There is only 11 minutes in an NFL game?
I know it is a game, I would think they would be ready to go and play if they had to, but who plays in a game?
There's a lot of standing around. Speaking of the Pats, when he played for them, Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his NFL career. He had good hands, but he had no good hands.
Yeah that is pretty amazing considering how physical the game is and how physical we are, yeah thats pretty amazing.
I am amazed that U of Iowa has a pink locker room for visitors.  I wonder if they do that for all the visitors.
Yeah, I head that is some pretty good lengths they went to for their opponents.
Yeah, Brady's book I supposed. I learned that Teddy Roosevelt and Jon Q. Adams were the only two presidents who did not use a Bible to be sworn in when they were sworn on as presidents and that was in Brady's Book
I dont know, maybe they didnt swear in with a bible because of athiests or something,  I dont know.
I don't know. I do know that someone found the actual tower of babel in Iraq though. That is wild.
That is wild, I wonder why they think that?
The end of the thing is that Jefferson cut out all the miracles, supernatural, miracles in the bible so that the bible could be used for the supernatural,
I guess he didn't like the way the bible was being written, but yeah.. well, good chat.To each his own I guess.
hey there, are you a football fan?
Yeah.  The game is brilliant.  I stay on the top of it.  Smart, smart.  They have a method that involves lots of avocado ice cream.  That's a method I would use to stay on top of the game.
lol yes, I like that method.  I wonder what he calls the " avocado ice cream" method...  and yeah I think I will try it, lol
Yeah, I think Tom Brady does. He is surprisingly spiritual, too.
I didn't know that. He has so many rings now.
ya he is, he's crazy, I know! Did you know that the average football games only have 11 minutes of actual playing? That's why there's no excitement with watching, there's only 11 minutes and the excitement with watch is in the actual playing.
Hey I guess the Iowa coach thought painting the visiting locker room pink was a good strategy, he thought painting it a pink would help.
Strange things have happened.  A few decades ago bowlers made twice as much as football players.
Yeah I hear you there. The 1916 Georgia Tech Cumberland game was played in the US.
I think that is a game I grew up loving to watch, what about you?
It is great! ESPN won an award for it!
Yes. I did. It's interesting to learn the history behind things like the symbols representing the 3 lines in american football games.
I heard that they want to add tracking chips to the padding on the players now.  Do you think that will help add more value to the players?
Yeah, I think it's a good idea to make oversight of the game and making calls more accurate. I think that would be a good way to make sure they are doing what they are supposed to.
Lol, I'm going to be watching drones now.  I'm pretty sure the NFL only produced one left handed quarterbacks, lol.
Yeah, and there is actually no written rule forbidding them from joining. I wonder if there will ever be women in the NFL. I know that women can't actually play in the nfl, but there is no written Rule forbidding it.
I don't think the WNBA would want to make up a women's team. They already have a womens team.
Yeah, I think if women do enter the NFL, the issues of fairness between players will arise.
Yes, that would change the game forever. Apparently the lifetime earnings of an engineer is nothing to compare to that of NFL players. I wonder how they compare, though.
I had no idea!  But I wouldn't mind being an engineer if I had no else idea of what I'd be doing.
I think it might be a long run for him, but I'd give up on retirement any day. A professional rugby player has to be able to have a 16 year career, so I'd be ok with that.
Very true!  It was nice talking to you.
Same here.  Don't forget to get the avocado ice cream!
Are you a fan of football?
Hi, yes I love football. I don't watch much anymore though. I hear Tom B wrote a book about it.
Yes, it is interesting. One of the things I learnt is the secret to the best avocado ice cream. The method. I love it and would have never guessed it would be a secret.
No I would never have guessedocado ice cream! I would have guessed it would be something else lol. I would not have guessed avocado is what made him do it though. Apparently football is his religion, he made it his religion. Apparently he is into football more than football is into ice cream
That makes sense. He seems very dedicated. I read that he was spiritual writer Deepak Chopra explaining the many similarities between sports and religion. I wonder how he became so dedicated? I have read a few books on sports and Religion.
Deepak's son Gotham Chopra is even bigger than football, more than Tom.
haha yes!  Chopra is actually producing the movie with him.  Brady has actually beaten father time.  Tom vs. time.
Yeah, winning the Super Bowl is no small achievement for him. Apparently the fans believe in him. There is a creed in Bill We Trust, "Winning the Superbowl is a small achievement".
Ahah it makes sense, Patriots fans are devoted and they love Belichick but Brady is basically the messiah. He is nothing compared to the other QB. I love Belichick and love Belichick But Brady is the Messiah.
I guess I would call Hell bound fans "hell bound", lol.  Did you hear he is slated to be slated to get his 4th super bowl ring and the 5th win in 2019, I guess he will get another super bowl Ring, I wonder who he will win it with?
I think it will happen again, he's done well in his career.  Bob Ryan has been in the news lately because of his book being creepy.  People are worried about him and his life and when he retires, what will happen to him?  What will he do?  Football?  I think he'll go back to football, but I don't think he will get a second career.
Yeah he does sound cultist but he is a great player and he can dabble in other things, yeah he does seem like a greatplayer,
I think that it's a New England thing, he is revered there so much that it is not surprising that he would be revered.  Have you heard of Benjarvus Green-Ellis?
Yeah I am sure.  I think he is a patriot player, right?
Yes he is.  One thing is sure, fumbling the ball is no recognition and an award is no career.    He got an award just for not fumbling it once during his career.
Maybe, I don't know. Did you know that the Iowa state visiting locker room is painted pink?
I'm guessing it's just to intimidate visitors?  But at this point I doubt people would be surprised if it were effective or if it was just to intimidating.
Yeah, I wonder. In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top NFL players and in the 60's top Bowlers made almost twice asMuch as the top NFL Players.
That is shocking, people didn't care about football back then at least. Now people care so much. Bowling games are only 11 minutes of game play and they are the best bowling games.
Unbelievable. What about ESPN winning an emmy?
I don't know, but I guess it shows more people care about football and the line they are creating is getting across the line.  I guess people care.  Well, it's been nice talking with you, have a good day!
Hi!  Are you a football fan?
Yep, how bout you?
Yeah, I used to watch it but not so much anymore. But I hear bowlers used to make more than top NFL players, did you know they make more?
I believe it.  It is amazing to learn how much it has changed.
Yeah it seems that way. And Tom Brady he swears by avocado ice cream.
I read that too.  I wonder if it is any good.
ya I haven't tried it, but I guess they say it is ok, I can't imagine it is, I wonder if you add enough sugar to it haha, I think that is what calls it a "method" I guess.
lol  I guess so.
I wonder if they have avocados. It's amazing that in the 1960s, bowlers made more then top performers.
Yeah, I was a bowler myself and I was pretty good, my uncle bowled a perfect game once.
Wow that's awesome!  The patriot produced in the turkey has never fumbled the ball in his entire career.
Yeah, his name was Benjarvis Green Ellis.
Yeah.  I kind of like the college game that scored 220-0. That's quite an accomplishment.
Yeah that is a lot of scoring for sure, double double double, lol. There was a dude who was called Benjarvis.
You have to make a choice.  If you are Georgia tech, and you were playing against "Cumberland, you can make a decision on a bus ride home.  I would not want to go to Georgia Tech.  But I would have wanted to go with Cumberland.
I bet they avoided playing them for awhile.
Did you hear about the Emmy that ESPN won?
Yeah, the yellow first down line.  It is a genius in my opinion, the first down is always yellow
Mine too made it a lot easier! I wish the NFL didn't keep women from playing, there is no written rule that keeps women from play, but I'm sure it is something they want to do since there is already a written rule about it.
I wonder if they would have to be a kicker or punter or something.  The status quo in any sport is the status quo.
Yeah, I think that is just the habit of the males.  Football is a males-only sport, and they discriminate.
I totally agree. Well it's been a good chat, I'm gonna have to go now.  Good chat.  TTYL.
Hello! Are you a football fan? Tom Brady recently released a new method of selling them and it is selling very well!
Hi! I like football. I like Tom Brady. I did not know that. I wonder how much of the book is actually used in football.
It is a book that details Brady's diet and training regiment that he credits with his being able to play football.
Sounds like a popular book. I wonder how many people read it. That is an impressive achievement.
I don't think it is really very popular. I guess a lot of people view it as a mix of sports and religion, but I think it's a mix.
I guess Tom has followers, but he is not a religious leader.
Yea I guess Boston fans are all about religion and Tom Brady is an apostle of the Patriots, the team has an apostle for their religion, so yea I guess that could mean something for the Patriots
They have apostles, apostles, religious figures, and the team has a name for them all.
Bill we trust is the Patriots' coach and the slogan, which refers to the Patriots name and slogan.
I guess it sounds like a religion.  Some people follow the guidance of a book and some make it part of their lives and a cult.  If a book becomes a best seller, some people follow it, some make a cult of it.
I guess so, it seems like a lot of the athletes who read it are also the fans of their teammates, like Tom Brady and his fans
I know, right?  He sold so many copies of the bible and even of the Bible!
I am not sure, but I am sure not that many!  Some people think Brady is just motivated by moeny to do it.
He's a football star. He does make a lot of money in a book. He's a lot more than a football player.
Hmm, I guess not.  I wonder if the top bowlers in the 1960s made as much as top football stars.  It was the second sport after football.  In the 1960's, top bowlERS only made twice as much.
I think that was the golden age of bowling, the sport was getting popular in the 60s and leagues formed, more people were getting into it, it was the first golden age, the leagues formed and it became a sport.
I think Brady is the best QB ever. Did you know that the average engineer makes more than a football player over their lifetime?  I wonder how much Brady makes.  The average engineer only makes $7,000 and a football players makes $100,000.
Sounds like a plan. Engineers are the best in the world if you ask me.
Yea football players do make a lot of money even though there is only 11 mins of actual gameplay and only 11 minutes of gameplay, but they do make it
I guess they feel like they worked hard to get paid for standing around. I guess they do, they get paid a lot. I wonder if they get more paid forStanding around.
Well it was nice talking to you.
hi, do you like football?
I am a fan, but not a fan of it. I know the basic names and some facts about it.
I have a passing knowledge in football.
Tom Brady I heard is very accomplished and successful, I guess he's branching out from football, he's also a QB, so I guess you can say he's a little more accomplished and success.
I did not know that. He is considered one of the best quarterbacks in history
He's worth my time buying his new book and watching his show.
I haven't seen his book, what is it?
It is a method for getting healthy both physically and spiritually, it is a kind of athletes bible, it helps you get healthy both mentally and spiritually.
I see that it has a mental component, spiritually, too.  I wonder if it is more or less than just the physical.
I think he's starting to conflate sport with religion.  I wonder if that's just a gimmick to sell some books?  I don't want to conflation sport with Religion, but maybe.
I think that is the case. I am not an expert on his achievements or about his physical body, but I am an expert in the health of his physical Body.
I can't deny his achievements. I think being a famous person adds to your cover. I wonder if any books he has written have been written by ghost writers? They are supposed to work with a famous people to help with the book but I wonder what they do instead. You can't just use a famous Person to do something.
That is true, but there has to be some proof that is true and that doesn't diminish a persons efforts.
I was just watching his documentary Tom vs Time, and he is kind of on the front of the legal page. I have no clue why he is on the legal side, but it's kind of an open secret. I am still watching his Documentary Tom vs time.
No, I will not.
I barely watch TV anymore.  I have access only when I'm driving kids to their sporting activities or I'm not driving kids.  But I can't watch TV in the evening for the evening football.  So I barely have access for TV.  What about you?
You can find a short version of it on TV, but it is only about 11 minutes long and only shows the live gameplay.  I would think that there would be more than dozen that are more than 11 minuteslong of real gameplay, but I can't seem to find ashort version of that.
Yes, that is the reason that I don't watch football. Only 11 minutes of actual action and yet I am hours in front of the television for a few hours inFront of the TV. I need to grab my bible and go watch some football.
Do you like to read from the Bible?
I used to when I was a kid.  I hear people quote from it often.  Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.  At times curious, sometimes not.  Did you go to school with one?
I agree. In any case, thank you for chatting with me!
Hi, how are you today?
I am good!  How are you doing?
I am good. I like football.
I do, I'm a packers fan so that is why, are you a packer?
Tom Brady wrote the athlete bible, a football one, I think, and Tom Brady wrote it.
I am a patriots fan, but not a fan of Brady.
I don't understand how the NFL can use tracking chips in the players shoulder pads.  Do you know what tracking chips are in the football?
I don't know either, I mean you can track everything today by tech and they are looking for the edge, they want the best edge.
Yeah, they are. They are everywhere
Do you know why the footballs are used?
That is crazy,  they must be tracking everything in the world for sure in my opinion
That's nuts, tracking velocity, rotation, rotation.  What does that even mean?
Yep they can do so much.
There is a lot of tech in baseball these days!
They sure are taking over the world, just like the cell industry.
I totally agree with you there.
Are you religious at all?
I am fairly well. How about you?
That is wild.  Thomas Jefferson had created his own version of the bible, a version where he remove the supernatural parts, because the bible does not allow it.  I wonder why he did that?  Did he want to remove the Supernatural parts or something?
That is wild, I didnt.
The biblical tower of babel is based on a real building in present day Iraq.
I read that too. I wonder if it has ever been there before?
Nice talking to you!  Have a nice one!
Tom Brady is a football legend, a great player and I agree, he is a great players, I think Tom Brady is the best,
I agree loved his Tom vs Tom documentary, do you agree loved him?
I loved it! I agree with you. He went from religion to Brady, football, and I think he loved it.
I think so too!  I want to read his book about his method. Have you read hisbook?
No, I didnt read it.  What is it about?
I read it too, I think he is helping himself by helping to stay at the top of the game, he has like 13 credits in that game
I will pick that book up sounds interesting, I think a lot of healthy habits can be learned from him, success is something that isnt achieved without discipline, I might pick thatBook up and learn a thing or two, I'm sure I can learn a lot more,
True. Did you know the university of iowa's visiting players locker room is painted pink?
I think it is confusing for the visiting players. I wonder what they think the faces of the visiting Players are going to think, it sounds really funny lol.
lol,  I wonder if they paid them well,  maybe they were paid better than the top football stars from back then,  in the 60's a bowler made more than the NFL player.  Did you know a bowLER made more then an NFL player?  lol
That's odd, considering how much money football players make now.
Another surprising money fact is the lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than that of an NFL or MLB player.
Engineers also make a lot of money, but that does make sense, they work for a few years and then get paid, engineers also make the most so it does makesense that they would make a whole lot ofMoney
I agree.  The highest scoring football game ever was in 1916 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0!
I bet that was a boring game, I wonder if there was points of difference, or if each team was playing a totally different sport, I bet it was a really boring game.
Lol, I know!  That is amazing!  Did you know Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his career?  That's amazing.
That is amazing, I bet he was one of the best players ever, that is an impressive record, I wonder why he did not get more, I think there are better players out there,
I can't imagine that. Did you ever read the bible?
Not really, I guess many people enjoy reading it, I dont really know much about God, but I guessmany people enjoy it,
I do! I find it interesting that it is the highest selling book of all time with over 4 billion copies sold.
I think a lot of religious people in the world do too. It is one of the oldest books and also one of its oldest books.
Hello! Are you familiar with Tom Brady? I'm interested in his new method aka the athlete's bible.
Hey there!  I am!  Hey, how are you?  I'm not really sure,  is he good?  Maybe one day I'll have to look him up.
Football is basically a religion.  I credit that lifestyle brand for keeping Tom Brady in great shape at his age.  He is worth at least $500k per year.  You can credit that lifestyles brand for getting him in great form at his old age. I'm just a fan so I'm not sure.  Thanks for checking with me.
I don't watch football a whole lot, but I do like hockey a lot.  I will check it out, and I am planning to follow the "go to" method you mentioned.  Are you familiar with it?  I am not sure if I am familiar with what you are planning to followed.
I have not yet but plan to follow one day. I don't know if it will do much for my health but if you can get in to it you should. The NFL off-season is so short, the regular season only lasts about 16 weeks, so for die hard fans it is like 5 weeks.
I honestly can't understand why it only lasts 17 weeks, it seems like it's months and I follow more regularly lol. I'm a fan of one team for about 3 months and then I just follow more often, I understand it only goes for 16 weeks, I'm not a fan for the other team for more than that lol
I like the Saints and the league in general. I'm surprised by the sexism in the league though. I mean, there's a rule in place that forbids cheerleaders and players from eating in the same restaurant, and I'm sure there are lawsuits for that misogynistic rule. I think it's silly. What's the other rule? What's in the place that forbid cheerleaders from going to the same place that's the same as a restaurant?
Sounds so surprising and difficult to believe that an average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay, that is so little, only 11 minutes, and yet there are only 11.5 minutes ofLive gameplay in an averageNFL game, that sounds so surprising
No, I suppsoe that is because the commercials drag on longer and make it take longer.  I'm surprised there are no rules against women playing in this day and age.  But knowing that there has not been a female kicker drafted in a while, I am surprised knowing there are still no rulesagainst women playing.
I was wondering about female players.  I had no idea they were even possible.  What kind of eligibility requirements do you have for them?
Honestly, I think someday we will, but it's going to be difficult for a female to even compete with Benjarvus Green-Ellis, who was the first drafted female running back in 2005. He never fumbled the football his entire professional career and never fumbles in any time he was drafted. He must have wanted to compete with benjarvUS green-ellis. That would be difficult!
True, I think I read somewhere that the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player is about $32,000, but I think the average of the enginner is higher, but that's probably because they make a lot of money.
Yeah that surprises me, but they make more than actual players.  One of the people who creates the tracking chips for shoulder pads and football are also one of the first people who created them.  I wonder how they know they are actually the actual players?  They use the tracking Chip for shoulder bags and footballs.
It's too bad for some people, but the industry is a lot of cash, and the players are a major part of it, so they get a lot, it's not bad for the people.
Agreed. It is downright sad! Heck, in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football players.
Interesting. I had no idea they changed that dramatically, meaning they had no clue what they were doing. NFL players have some strange rules. New orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurants as the NFL players. I have no idea why this rule is. It's a stupid rule, meaning there's no way they can really know what they're eating. They're forbidden from even eating there, what a stupid rules.
Sounds like a discrimination to me to be completely honest. What's even more silly is Georgia Tech actually beat the US team 220-0 back in 1916 in the highest score ever in a football game. Sounds like a humiliating game to me, but the football team was the best. That was so silly!
I can only imagine this score has been around a long time.  I would absolutely not want to be the players of lost team remembered for a long, long time for that game.  It would be better if the players were not remembered.
I don't know how they would've taken that score. I'm sure they were angered by the university of Iowa's locker room was pink for the score. Did you know Georgia Tech's lockerroom was pink? Haha.
Lol, that would be a good joke! I have read about pink color of dressing room before and it's always a change that I expect should happen.  I don't know, I mean, when I read that, I would think that the competitors play better if they had to change the color of where they play or where the competitors played.  It's not like a pink color to have a good laugh at the competitors, but that's what I would expect should be the case.
I think that would anger a team for sure. One thing I wanna know is why. Speaking of the Bible, did you know the Bible was translated from Latin and the name malus is the fruit that is evil to the apple? I'm gonna go look that up one day, its been great chatting with you, speaking of the bible, the apple was actually the name of the fruit used when the bible was translated into latin, I wonder why they didn't use malus, I'm sure it's a fruit that's great, anyways its been a great chatting, I really like chatting with ya!
Howdy, how are you doing?
Hello, I'm great! How bout you.
Fine.  Have you read the book The Bible?
No I dont, I have read parts of it, but I dont read it word for word, you?
I have read it and I still do not understand its secrets, but I do know that it is a popular book, many people have read through and understand its secret.
I dont see it as a good set of rules for a good person. I mean, it literally is a set ofRules to live by, but not a goodSet of rules to be a good Person.
It's still hard to fathom, but it's a good guide to the conscience and there are many lessons buried deep in the scriptures that are hard to take seriously.  The scriptures are a good Guide to the lessons of our conscience.
yeah that is true, the bible has sold over 8 billion copies, copyrithg the 1st copyriths of the bible have sold 5 billion copies
I guess the money goes to the church?  Who knows?
Yeah,  I was kind of in the wrong time and in the right place at the wrongTime, lol.  That was kind if a joke.  Yeah,  maybe a joke...
I understand. I think its a really funny joke.  The bible is not beholden to man's laws.  It is held to a higher power, it has copyright.  A higher power that is beyond man's Laws.
I feel sorry for the companies who print and sell the bible. They have to make a profit and that is how they make a Profit.
They probably do.  If they wrote something, they want to print it with their eyes on it.  The contents of the book are for profit and remain pure to the eyes of the one who wrote it. They want to profit and Remain pure.
Yeah, I have no faith in humanity.
Possibly.  Some things are not good in the Bible.  The laiety of the people are in the book of the Bible but the bible was not all good either.
True, but people used the bible for what it said, people who believe in God were not persecuted for that.
Bible is the book of the truth. The world holds many secrets from that book. I wonder what is inside the two books that will be unearthed in the next book. The World holds many surprises for us, I know that I do.
I think its important to try and aid yourself in being a good person everyday and thank God for that. I dont know xactly how the bible came to be but it was changed and rewritten many times and its important that we keep the original, it has its message but it has been rewritten a few times but the message is still the same, help yourself and be a good people and thank god.
It's the newest the truest, the best understanding of truth is always the original.  But, I look forward to the studies and further studies to get a better understanding of the original, and look forward for a better and better understanding for you as we go from best to the truEST understanding oftruth.  Have a good evening!
I hope so!  Great conversation!  Have a good one, I hope you have a great one.
Same to you.  Thanks.
Bye! :) ;) bye
hey there how often do you enjoy football?
Hi there!  I am a big fan of it!  It is a great sport and a great game!  How about you?
Yeah I really like it. I love watching the playoffs.
Who is your favorite team?
I like the patriots, how about you?
I like the Patriots.  I live in New England and they are one of our winning teams lol.
Cool. Brady is the best QB in the book. It's like an athletes bible. It has helped him stay at the top of his game at age 41. I wonder if he's in the top 3.
He sure does, I hear he loves avocado icecream, I wonder if they have a lot of flavors, I know they have  a lot
Did you know that he likes avocados?
thank god for avocado icecream LOL, icecream plus avocado doesnt seem like a good combination, maybe that will do the trick for Brady, ice cream plus avocado is the only good combination
Haha yeah. Patriot's running back Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his career.
That is crazy!  That takes a level of skill that guy had,  fumbling a ball is a hard thing to accomplish,  that is a really hard thing for anyone to do.
I can't believe the locker room at the University of Iowa is painted pink for visiting football teams.
That is funny, I bet that is very intimidate to the other team.  A win 222-0 intimidating to the same team.
I don't think that would work very well. I guess that's why you don't hear about professional bowling anymore. In the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as football players. That's insane, I know top bowler's made twice what top football players make!
I think football is a lot more popular than back then, but I think that's because they were.
Yeah, it has come a long way in technology as well. The NFL uses tracking chips in the footballs and in the player's shoulder pads.
I've heard that, but I'm sure its pretty expensive to use them.  Did you know there are 16 teams, with a lot of players per rooster, that is a lot to have a lotOf players per Rooster?
The average game is only 11 minutes, including all the balls used for the balls in the average game, so that's not too much.
That is an unreal stat, but I do know that the game can go for hours each quarter so its probably only 11 minutes without ads, so that is about 3 hours of game, that is almost two hours each third
Apparently it's calculated on live gameplay, haha. Well it was great talking with you, I'm off to dinner now, but apparently it's Calculated on live game play! Ha! Bye!
Hello there, are you interested in football?
Hello, yes, I like it. I think it's interesting that the NFL has no rule against female players.
Yeah, I think that is very sexist, especially considering that cheerleaders have to leave if football players come in.
I think the NFL uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record their moves on the field, to avoid these situations.
That's a very good point. I mean, they're absolutely innovative in that way. The technological innovation is way out of line but still absolutely innovative.
Engineers are probably the best profession for women to choose. The average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than that of an NFL player and the average lifetime earning of a engineer are lower.
Engineering is definitely better than football.  And engineers have to work longer because in football games there is only 11 minutes of live game play.  I think they could work longer if they had to.
That is true, but if you are an engineer there would be less risk of concussion, right?
True, but it was not needed or loved football.  In the 60s the top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players for that reason.  I think there is a country where the top Bowlers made more than the top Football players for some reason.
Bowlers were lucky to have that golden age of the sport. I would think we would never return to that, but maybe the bowlers were luckier.
Yeah I agree. I think football records are objectively more interesting. Have you heard of Benjarvus Green-Ellis?
I have not, but the guy never once fumbled a football! I would have like to know the prize for that feat, a $100,000 bonus or something.
I think he got a similar in terms of impressiveness, but ESPN got an award for creating the 3-yard line, not an awardfor creating a first down line.
I would like to see him get it for the bible.
I know that a lot of religious texts are Similar to the Hebrew Bible, the Greek Septuagint, and the GreekSeptuag Int. The New Testament overlaps with the Bible and a lotof religious texts
True.  It's not uncommon for american students to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education.  I think it's actually not uncommon at all.
That makes sense, the Bible is a huge part of American culture, it is made up of so much. Teddy Roosevelt and other presidents used to swear in with the Bible, it makes sense that they were the first presidents to use it,
I think Adams did too!  I believe he swore in under the constitution, so he felt that he owed allegiance to the government as well as the people to whom he swore.  I think the other two were Adams and the government.
Ahh, nice! On the other hand Thomas Jefferson found middle ground and used a razor to cut out his own version of the Bible. On the one hand Thomas jefferson found middle Ground with a razor and his own Bible, and on the other, a Bible with a different version of it.
He wanted to be a practical guy, and to see religion in humanist terms. He was a humanist.
Ahh that makes sense.  Well it was nice talking to you, have a good day.
Hey! How's it going? Do you like the NFL? It's crazy that there are 32 teams! I know I do!
I do enjoy the NFL. I'm a Bears fan so that helps. Do you enjoy the nfl?
Me too, but I like the Patriots more, especially the Patriots.  Tom Brady was in a book recently, did you see that?
I did not know that. I wonder what he is in it about?
It's an athelete bible. It's the best selling one, it has tips for success in life.
I had no idea.  Speaking of the Patriots, do you know that he has never fumbled a football.  He's never fumbling for the Patriots.
That is awesome, his name was Benjarvus, he used to play, but I do not think he does anymore but he is still awesome,
Benjarvus Green-Ellis had no fumbles and only ended his career with two fumbles.  In the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football players.
Wow thats impressive!  Crazy to think that an engineer will earn more money later in life than an NFL player.  That is because players only play for limited years and then an engineer/artist/etc.  NFL players only played for limited times.  But, wow thats impressive.
Engineers are probably easier on the body than sports. I wonder if people would aspire to them, or if it would just be easier for them to have a lot of money.
yup I agree, you wear tracking chips in the field that can track your movements and speed and such, and they can wear tracking Chips in them to track your activities.
I hear that players wear tracking chips in their shoulder pads and in the ball. I wonder if they have them on purpose or for just the ball?
I think it tracks their lcoation, velocity, velocity and also the ball rotation.  They hope that it helps prevent injuries and other things.
I hope so too. One question I have is how do they make calls on the field with it though.
I don't know,  why?  I'm not sure.  It would probably help with so much stuff imo.  Do you know any saints btw?  There is a cheerleader for the saints b/c she is a former cheerleader
No, I missed that boat!
Haha, well I cna't believe the saints are the only ones to treat their cheerleaders so well. I wonder how well they treat them in restaurants with players? Do they treat their cheeringleaders well?
That's worse, I hear if a player enters while a cheerleader is already eating a leave and then if they stop eating aLeave again, it's even worse, if a cheerleaders already there and a player comes in they have to leave.  It is ridiculous and very upsetting.
yup I agree, would you ever watch a football game with women playing? I wonder if it will ever happen
I think we will start with a league and then maybe a lingerie bowl.  There is no exploitation of the league.
haha ya I agree with you, I think they coul dhave a female kicker, there is no rule against that, and they cous dhave  a female kickers, I don't see the need for a rule against it
Do you watch the NFL?
I love watching the NFL, do you?
Me too. Iowa painted their visitor locker room pink
I live right down the street from the stadium, I have never been to a game there, but I have been to their stadium.
Nice. Have you? ESPN won and Emmy?
I heard that! I like how it looks. I like the yellow
Yeah they invented the superimposed yellow line, it was because of the yellow line.
WOW. Do you watch college football at all? The highest score was 222-0, which is the record, but I don't know if you know that or not.
Yeah, that was when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland back in 1916.
Can you imagine if they quit trying to take Cumberland down?
Yeah pretty bad defeat. Did you know that women can play in the NFL as well?
I did not know that. I know men can play in the WNBA.
I guess there are no rules about it, but I guess it is fair for them to play if they want to. Did you hear about tracking chips that the players use and the rules?
I heard. I think engineers want to make more money off of them. I wonder how much they are made, if it is made by the players who wear them or the engineers that make them?
Yeah I'm not surprised. They also track everything from velocity to location, I think.
I bet they do. Do you watch ESPN?
I do from time to time.  Off topic and off topic but do you like the Bible?
I know a little about the bible. What about you?
Very cool!  Here are some facts: It has been sold over 1 billion copied!
That's crazy, how much money has it had, I wonder what they do with all that money though?
I have no idea but talk about an influential book.
Hi, do you watch the NFL?
I do!  My favorite team is the Patriots.  Love Brady.  How about you?
I do as well! Nice that he wrote a book!
Yeah the Athelete's Bible, it's called Time vs Tom, I saw that on the documentary Serios, it was called Time Vs Tom.
Yeah I am looking forward to that one, I wonder what his favorite ice cream flavor is?
Yeah, avocado. I guess eating healthy is the way to go. He's gotten in shape at this age.
Do you think women can play in the NFL?  Did you know women canPlay if they want to?
Yeah if they meet the requirements, pretty cool.
Yeah. Engineers make more over their lifetime than most football players do.
I did not but it makes sense since football players have a pretty short career and engineers have a longer one, so it makessense since football Players have a long career andEngineers only have a short one
Yeah it does. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
Yes that was in 1916 by Gergia Tech versus cumberland, they beat them 222-0
Yes and ESPN won an Emmy for that game.
Yeah they won for the superimposed yellow line
Yes, I am thankful for that.  It makes watching the game from home much easier!
Me too. Did you hear about NFL using tracking chips on the players on the field?
Yes, measuring a bunch of stuff like rotation and velocity, etc.
I hope that they use that data to make the game a bit safer and less likely to have concussions.
I really hope so too. I hear New Orleans cheerleaders have a weird rule about not being able to use their names though, I think thats a weirdRule but they have to endure, I hope that changes.
Yeah, they can't eat in the same restaurant as the players?  I wonder if they can eat there?
I hope they can just get rid of it. Nice chatting with you, I need to be going.
Hi there!  Are you a football fan?
I am, it is a great sport, the world loves it.
It is, I like it, I don't have a favorite, but I like the teams. Do you?
I have to choose between the God team more spiritual than the rest and a team more spiritually, what about you?
I think the Vikings since they are from Vikings.  I think the University of Iowa is Gods country, I think.  But I like Iowa since Iowa is God's country.
I guess the Vikings are a good choice, I'm not a Christian God myself but it sounds biblical so I guess the vikings would be a good one. Iowa is a Christian god, right?
Yes I agree. Iowa painted their visitor locker room pink
I did not know that! I wonder what the folks in Iowa were trying to do with that? I know that it's breast cancer awareness, but I would like to learn the risk of breast cancer in football players so I can learn more about it.
Good guess for some reason.  They also have to deal with psyching out the team, so calming down is a good way to deal.  It is a team.
Yes, it's a double purpose, to soften the team and to make them receptive to the important message about breast cancer during the game. It's an important message, but it doesn't seem to help much.
That's a great point, especially since it can be affected by anyone.
I have not been affected.  I have been very passive about it and calm and have been trying to be passive.  Although there is a pink locker room for those affected, I wonder where it is?
lol, I didn't know that meant breast cancer! I wanted to know whether a woman could play in the NFL, if woman could. I don't think so.
I didn't know that.  I wonder if there is a pink locker room.  How could they possibly feel more comfortable in a pink room?
I agree, but that seems kind of sexist.  The saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if the players come in, lol.  Kind of sexist that they have to get up and leave, but I agree.
That is such a blown opportunity to raise cancer awareness for the players and cheerleaders.
I like that Tom Brady is an advocate for the breast cancer awareness.  I like how he is against breast cancer.  Do you know how he got into it?
I think he would do well to do that!  He once brought in an avocado for a half, and only brought in 1 avocado.
lol, I know he could!  He could write his own athletes bible, or write his "Athletes Bible".
That would be a good step in the right direction!  I think influence is all we have to go on.  We have enough power without it.
Good chatting with you!  Have a good one!
Tom Brady of the New England Patriots is a wonderful player and is a great QB.
I guess I should not call him wonderful.  lol  I am not a Patriots fan.  So I guess I am a Patriots fans,  but I do not like him lol
The NFL is the major profession football league in North America.
I watch it every week, do you?
I do, my favourite team is the 49ers, did you know the NFL regular season runs from September to December?
I am a die hard steelers fan, I watch it every year.
I'm a great fan of the chicago bears!
LOL, I heard it put so elegantly.
Did you know that the NFL has no written rule against female players women would in fact be allowed to met the eligibility criteria and there is no writtenRule against female player.
I would not worry about my daughter playing football if that were to happen.
Me too, I think the NFL uses tracking chips in their shoulder pads to record move of the players on the field and it could help improve the game.
I didnt know that, interesting stats.  I wonder what they are used for?
Well the revenue of the player is not that high compared to other sports but the team that is able to win the trophy is still the best team. The revenue of their teammates is very high compared with other sports
Me too.  The average engineer actually make more over the lifetime than an NFL player.  Crazy.
Interesting! I didn't know that.
Another interesting fact is that the average NFL game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay, an average nfl game only has 11 minutes and 17 seconds of live play.
I can see why the U of Iowa locker room for football team is completely painted pink.
I wonder if that effects the opposing team?
It's probably based on the biblical tower of Babel. It's a real building in modern Iraq that is based on a real tower of babel.
I didn't know that, I wonder who wrote the Bible, it makes no sense, maybe he was from the future, I'm not sure.
Yes, the Bible is a product of divine inspiration which define the relationship between God and human beings and the product of Divine inspiration.
Yeah, did you know that presidents swear to something with a bible and then use it as their bible.
Yes, I did know that. I think every US president has had swearing-in ceremonies.
Yeah, John Quincy Adams and Teddy Roosevelt.
Yes, that is correct.
TTYL!  TTYL
Hi, do you like the Bible?
I know that it was one of the best selling books of all time with over 4 billion copies sold and very influential. It was one the most influential
Not that I know of.  It's not uncommon for American students to read from the bible as part of their elementary education though.
Wow, that is surprising.  I did not know that.  The only presidents who did not use a bible at their swearing in ceremonies were Adams and Roosevelt.
I would have swore on the Constitution.  I wonder if they felt it was a loyal to the law of the land or the people?  Or they felt they were just following the law to the best of their ability.
I see. King Jefferson created his own version by cutting out the supernatural parts of the first version, what do they call it.
lol  He wanted to keep all the good ones.  Yeah,  and he did it to try to keep religion in humanist terms.  lol
That's pretty cool.  I wonder if he based the tower of Babel on the Etemenanki in Iraq, which is based off the Bible, which also is based the Tower of Babel.
I can't imagine that the language has changed much in our Bible, I would imagine that there is a basis in fact for so many things in it.  It's hard to detect how much language has change if it's hard enough to detect.
That is true, and speaking of different language, I found out recently the word apple was used in the Bible when the Bible was translated to Latin because malus means evil and apple is associated with evil, I wonder why, I'm not sure what the word means, but I know that the word Apple was used when the bible was translated.
That's an interesting coincidence. I guess it means evil because of evil, but tasty because of the name? I wonder if New eve actually ate one, I guess he didn't think it was tasty
Speaking of bibles, are you familiar with the athlete bible aka "the bible?" I'm familiar with it's method Tom Brady uses to stay on top of his game.
I am not. What does Tom Brady do?
I don't follow the NFL either, but I understand that the average game is only 11 minutes long in terms of live gameplay.  That is crazy to me.
I do, it is actually a 3 hour affair, but I do like to make money. The average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than the average lifetime of an NFL player. It is pretty risky to become an NFL Player, but it is a way to make a little more money.
That's crazy because back.In the 1960's the top football players made more than the top bowlers. As a matter of fact, as a matter, that's actually kind of sad, because top bowler's made more.
i guess bowling is such a big sport and had so many sponsors that it helped them earn money.
True!  On a related note, did you know there are no rules against women playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements?  I mean, there are already some females signed up and there have been a few females signed on.
I think that's why they make gameplay so much more. The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
True. Did you know that the Saints ever drafted a woman? I wonder if they have any female cheerleaders now. They have a silly misogynist rule that forbids them from eating in the same restaurant as the football players, and it forbids them to even be eating there if they're female. I wonder why they think that would apply to cheerleaders?
I think the league has a lot of attitudes that would need to change. Thanks for the chat!
Agreed, the regular season is only 11 weeks long from September to December, plenty of time to make it better, and great chatting, the season is already 13 weeks long, so there's still plenty ofTime to make changes
Do you watch the NFL?
I do my favorite is Tom Brady and the Patriots, what about you?
Oh man! That guy is the best.  I guess his favorite ice cream kind is his favorite.  What's your favorite ice CREAM kind?
No, I can not but it makes sense. Is it avocado?
Yes, it is. He is a health conscious and watches what he eats. He must be a guy who is health conscious.
Did you hear about the book, the true story?  Did you hear of it?  Is it a true story.
I read it, it's an athlete's bible, it is amazing and its the best read ever,
I have not but I will give it a try. Do you watch the Tom vs Time series?
Yeah that sounds pretty cool. Did you know women can play in the NFL?
Yes they can, as long as they meet the requirements and make the cut they can.
Yes. Engineers make more money than football players over the lifetime.
Yeah I guess it makes sense since their careers are longer and they have more opportunities to make money so I guess they do, and yeah I guess that makes sense
That's a good point.  Did you know they are using tracking chips on the players now?
I think they are collecting so much info on velocity and rotation and such.
I hope they use it to make the game safer for the players and maybe even make some sense to the players, I'm not sure though.
I hope so! On a different topic, do you like the Bible?
I do. It has sold over 4 billion copies.
That seems like a lot of books, I guess it is one of the most influential books in history, one of most influentialBooks in history
Pretty amazing. Jefferson created his own version.
Yes, that is what I heard. I heard he cut out the supernatural parts with a razor.
Yes and he did not want to have to use the same stuff again
Hello, do you watch the NFL?
I do!  I like the NFL!  The National Football League is going to go offshored to China soon.  I would rather have the whole thing go broke than have the thing go off the offshoring to China.
Nope, only 32 teams!
Yes they add a team every other year and now there are 32
There are 30 teams and they are currently sitting at 29 teams with the season only being over six weeks.
That is a good length, 17 weeks, I guess it is a really good length.  Football is a very good game, I am glad that it is still going on.  I think football is the best game of the year.
Yeah ever year. The Superbowl is always topped off by the bowlers, they make more than football players in teh US, they top football players, and they do not make more in the superbowl
I guess the football players chose the wrong sport to go out and make money in.  Now they wear their helmet bowling is the only way to make money.  I wonder why they still wear their Helmet.
In any case, things have changed. Engineers still make more than football players.
Engineers are good at engineering. I think that engineers makes more than football players. I wonder why. Maybe engineers make more when playing football?
Yup, did you know that women can play if they qualify?
Yes if they qualify by doing a road test or a written exam.
Yes there is a physical exam that all the players have to pass in order to play to ensure that they can make the game, so they have to do a physical test in order for them to pass, so you would think there would be more of a physical examination to be able to play.
Oh I see, I guess I'll have to make sure to look into that.  Do you know why the women are the best team?
I would hope so! I would hope they would take the field and do well! Do you know who Benajrvus Green-Ellis is?
I do, the guy that fumbled every ball he was touched.
yeah, what a career! I wonder how well he would do now that the NFL is sing tracking chips for the players and the NFL
Did not know that.  NFL is singing tracking chips?
 opp typo, they are using tracking chips to track velocity and rotation and such.  I hope they can use them to make the game safer.  Hopefully it will help make the games safer.
I think fan safety is a priority for the nfl. a player might suddenly come flying at you and fans can't see what's going on. singing chips are a good way to help.
I guess so.  It has been nice chatting, but I have to go.  I will let you go.
What are your thoughts on Brady?
I'm a football fan, but I do not live in New England, I'm in Foxboro, New England.  Are you a football fans?
I am a big fan of the QB Brady, a very skilled player.
He is dedicated to the game and really great at being great at it.  He has had so many seasons where he didn't play-and did not play in the first few seasons because of his dedication to thegame.
I don't know but I bet he can do a lot more games in front of us, he's only 30 years old and he's done a lot of games in the earlier years of his wholre ritual. Some players retire at that age and he doesn't. I wonder how many of those players retire and then go through that wholr rituals again and do the same earlier.
Well apparently there is a lot of injuries and concussions that they give up on. I suppose you can have a whole life after 40, but not many do.
I know football is a whole different thing.  There is a lot of money in it now.  One thing is for sure the brain damage from being a player is that the leyend will be different.
No surprise he is making a ton of money on endorsements, and his wife is going to retire next year, so he is sure to be making a tons of money, and it is not just from playing.
I bet people will buy that, he doesnt need to play football in order to win a lot of money he is already writting otheres so much money, and he makes money by just writting, I bet people want him to play Football in order for him to win more money, he makes Money just for writting
I think he's one of the best sellers of his life. I think he could coach later on, but the injuries would destroy the quality of his books and push him to the point where he would have to become a coach, because the injurieswould destroy his life
I agree, he should retire. He has won everything he has done as a player and he is a Hall of Famer and cosidered one of the best QBs in the NFL history, he has won 4 td's in his career, so he should just retire, right?
I think it would be interesting if a woman meet the eligibility requirements to be able to break his record, but I'm not sure if a lot of players would be willing to give a lot, or if a man could.  Can a womanMeet the eligibility Requirements?
It would be interesting I agree, I don't think it is going to happen, but it would be very interesting I would like to see that.
I wonder if the locker room would have to separate or if it could just happen in a separate room.
No worries lol, that would be a logistic problem. Football players are so strong a takle must hurt a lot, I would break a bone, no worries lol.
That's probably why women have smaller bones than men, they have to get on the bottom of the piles they end up on and that can be damaging, plus women have small bones than Men, so a recipe for disaster on the top and the bottom.
That would be a recipe for disaster, but I think I would still watch the whole thing, I like to watch it.
I wonder if a woman has met the requirements?  There's only 11 minutes worth of live play in a game.  I wonder how many minutes of that is actually live play?
Wow! I know it's only 11 minutes but to me, it seems a lot longer!
I figure that is because of the ads-lol.  Coaches have to figure out how to get ads out.  That happened to some coaches in the 60s!
That would be a hard thing to do. Especially the fact that the whole fact is only 11 minutes.
Hello, do you watch the NFL?
I do! Do you have a favorite team or player?
I do. I like Brady a lot, do you?
Nice!  What's your favorite ice cream flavour?
I am surprised the guy isn't more health conscious, he has an avocado as his.
Yes he wrote a book on it, he is the author of it
He also wrote the athelete bible. Do you read it or use his method?
Yeah I haven't either, I'm curious to watch the documentary series Tom vs. Time, it's going to be on TV in the US soon
I haven't, but I'll keep an eye out for it.  Iowa painted their locker room for the visitors.  Do you know why?
I wonder if that has any effect on the highest score in the college football?  Do you know what the highestscore was in college football ever was?
I think it was 222-0 and Georgia tech totally crushing Cumberland
Yeah that was one game. Did you hear about NFL using tracking chips for the players now?
Yes, they are tracking all sorts of stuff. They can track velocity and rotation, etc.
Yeah, I hope they use those stats to make the game safer for everyone.
I hope so too. DO you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
Yeah he used to play for Patriots, never fumbled the ball in his career, only once in his whole career.
Yeah he did that throughout his career. Did you hear of the rule for New Orleans cheerleaders?
Yes and the worst part is that they have to leave mid meal!  I hope they don't have to, that seems really weird!
Yeah it really is. Do you know much about the Bible?
I know that it's one of the most influential books in history, it's sold over 4 billion copies and one of most influential book in history
Yeah, that is very true.    It is part of our education system as well so it is very much true.
Hi, how are you today? What do you think about football?
I do like it, its a popular sport, both male and female athletes all over the world play football, male andFemale athletes.
Interesting, Tom Brady has show on facebook watch on FB
I do not know who Tom Brady is.  Do you know who he is or what country he used to play for?
He's an american foot ball player.  New England Patriots.  Tons Brady.
I do. New England has a soccer team. They are good, but I think there are more Americans that play football.
Yes.  It was named after one of the New England colonized states of the United States, and it was named for one of England's colonized States.
I think the United States is a big country with many soccer teams, many famous ones.  Tom Brady player has some soccer skills, he has scored 40 goals in a game and scored 3 goals, he is a soccer skills.  I think Tom Brady is the best QB in the United State, he scored 40 points in 2007
He does not. I think a lot of his fans think that Brady is sort of a messiah figure to some fans, given his gruff demeanor and ragamuffin fashion sense.
Sounds like a Jesus figure to me, long hair and flowing robes.  I don't see the Jesus figure in him, though.
He does lol, I think Americans are weird that way,  we show support for him lol
I guess he is a great athlete, but I guess he has always been admired as a biblical figure, a biblicalFigure from the Bible, have you heard of the Bible?
I have andf absolutely, do you use the bible?
I do, but I have not understood it and I do not understand some of the deep and abiding truths of it. I am glad people like Tom Brady have found those truths and I am sure they have found their truths as well.
It definately is the most sold book of all time.
i figure the guy who wrote it must have made a ton of cash on royalties at this point.
Yea but I wonder if it's being excluded from the presidential signing because he's been there so many times before? There's been a presidential signing for it over 100 times!
I guess I have been there a few times, and I forgot to bring the bible. I don't know the size and the amount of power of the Bible, but I guess I should have.
Good talking to you!  Have a good one!
Nice, stay biblical and take care.
Thanks! You too! I will!
Hi, how are you? What are you talking about? Do you like the bible?
I'm happy to talk about it.  It's not uncommon to do so.  In the US, students have been required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education since 1963, and students in the UK have been reading from the Bible as part if their Elementary education since 1962.
I feel like it is an option to learn, but also a bit forced since people have the option to choose their own religion. I think it is essential for people to learn and to understand the perspectives of other individuals and it is also essential for some people toLearn about others religions.
I think it's important to understand other perspectives as well.  Thomas Jefferson created a new version of the Bible by cutting out the supernatural parts of the bible, cutting out everything about the resurrection and the miracles and taking it in humanist terms.  I wonder if he was taking it on Humanist terms?
I wonder how many edits he had left in his bible from his edits?
True.  I'm not sure.  Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams had a similar view on the bible and swore in with a Bible.  They swore in using a Bible at their swearing-in ceremonies.  Both swore in by using the US Constitution.
I wonder why, it must have been a symbolic gesture, right?
It is. There's also a connection to historical fact. The biblical tower of babel, which is based on a real building, the Etemenanki in Iraq, is actually a realBuilding, not just based on the Bible.
I wonder how accurate the events depicted in the bibles are since it is not always the most instructive stories, but rather more instructivestories
True, I think it is true. The word malus came into the language of our language in the 4th century when the Bible was translated into Latin. It is interesting coincidence that the word is from the Latin "malus" which means apple and evil. It describes both in the same word and means apple several times. Interesting coincidence for some reason.
I think meat was lost in translation in the bible as well. Did you know that one third of meat waslost in translation from the Bible?
Good question. It's a very popular book!  It's been a billion copies since first being available in 1853.
I think it's also popular in the US, but kind of the same as "The Game of Telephone", it was incorrectly translated into the US and became popular.  5 billion copies.
True, it is all lost in translation, like the Tower of Babel, or incoherence.  It kind of has that truth in it.  Kind of like the truth that gets lost in Translation.
I don't see the significance of the biblical tower of Babel at all, but maybe it was Etemenanki who came up with the name for it, the tower of babel.
I don't know. The Bible is so sparse that there is no evidence of that in the Bible.
I wonder when the first flood happened?
I think the flood would have happened locally, the creation of the arc sounds oddly metaphorical, I think that mount ararat does exist, so the flood could have happened local, but the flood of the creation as a whole arc sounds odd.
Mount Ararat?  I did not know Mount Ararat was actually there!
It is supposedly the place where Noah's ark went after the flood waters receded, and the rest of them after it, it was supposedly theplace where noah ark came out of the flood
Thanks for explaining, it was an interesting discussion.
Are you a Tom Brady fan?
I respect some of his accomplishments and despise some of him's tactics. I heard he was in the Chopra series, I think. What do you think about his tactics?
Apparently there is a plan in his life that involves avocado ice cream.
Yes, he and his wife both eat healthy and exercise. He believes that his lifestyle is productive and he follows the bible. I think that athletes should be able to eat healthy, exercise, and use their money for a better lifestyle.
Yeah, and Bill will trust him, he's spoken of it in terms like Messiah and a great quarterback. I think Bill willTrust me on that one.
No doubt about that.  He's won 5 Super Bowls and was caught cheating once.  That's a great accomplishment, but I'd argue he's doing a better job than any coach that has ever won, no doubt, but you can't argue with his approach.  I think he's done a great job.
I hear the coach is on the injured list too and that's funny, he should be on the injuring list but not the coach.
The coach is a cultlike one that keeps his opponents guessing. The Brady book is creepy. The writer claims that the coach is "creepy" but the Brady book? I think the coach has a cult like following that is creepy enough to keep opponents guessing...
I wonder if that makes him think that the term Messiah is coming? I mean it is amazing how the term messiah is used. I mean top NFL players of all time made more than bowlers in the 1960s and it makes you wonder why.
True, but the NFL does a great job of marketing to increase the value of the product and their teams.  I think the NFL has done a greatjob of marketing, as well.
There are 32 in the NFC and the AFC, they are divided equally between the two.
The revenue from the games they have to play is enough for the regular season, but the revenue from all the games that they play is too much.  It is spread over the 16 weeks of the regular year.
I wonder how much money that is? I know that the highest scoring game ever was 222-0.
I believe it was college, I think it was in 1916, the team Oklahoma beat Texas, 77-0, right?
That's impressive.  I think it was when they played each other and the score was 220-0.  That is quite impressive.
I can't, it was Alabama or Clemson right?
I like Georgia tech and Cumberland, did you know Georgia Tech and Cumberlanders lost only once?
A lot of teams make money in the NFL and a lot of them don't make the play-offs, in total 32 teams make the Play-offs out of the 32 things in the whole NFL
Wow, and only one team plays in the last 2 games and then they have a bye week, and then one team play after that.
Yes, it is a best of seven game, one team single elimination with one game per division, and then the best of three game for each division with the winner going to the super bowl.  The wild card winner in the tournament gets a wild card to the Super Bowl.  That ending would be the worst record in the whole tournament.
I'm excited to see where it's held, it's usually held in the first week of February, lol. Did you know that the average live game is only 11 minutes of real game play? I wonder if that will be different this year? I don't think there will be 11 minutes, lol!
I think college ball has about 20 percent more plays than the 11 minutes we only have. Nice chatting with you.
Hey there how's it going? What do you think of Tom Brady? Love him and glad he wrote a book, I'm glad he's wrote abook
Hey! I do like him he is a great player. I like his avocado icre cream a lot.
Haha I would eat some of that haha. I think it is crazy that he is so good and is in such good shape and he likes avocado. I would never eat it.
Maybe, he must be super healthy, I guess his book was so good he was dubbed the "athlete bible"
Yup, I like that!  Do you watch a lot of football games btw?
I do from time to time, but I'm not fully dedicated to it.
I watch the big games and I usually follow a team, I like teams that win, I don't like teams with the parties like the Patriots haha, do you ever watch the Big games?
Hahah well good choice. Do you know who Benjarvus is?
No, I do not. He was a player that never fumbled the ball. The man must have been a star. The highest scoring football game ever was a football game.
Yeah that was in 1916 and yeah it was a good day for Georgia Tech who beat Cumberland 222-0. Have a good Day!
Yup that is something that if all the football players that woudl be fantastic. Imagine how dissappointed youd be if you wore a Cumberland shirt that day haha. I can't believe bowlers still made more than football players in the 60s, Imagine if bowlers actually wore a cumberland shirt!
Yeah, bowling alleys used to be fun.  I'm heading out of football, though.  Maybe engineering pays better.  Or football.
Maybe, but NFL and MLB players only last for a lifetime.
Yeah, well they deserved money!  They need tracking chips to help the players, too!
I did not know that, that's scary to me, I hope they disable the chips off field and just use stats.
I think they have them implanted in their shoulders pads and in their shoulder pads while wearing their uniform, I hope that too. I think it would make the game safer and they could be implanted in the shoulders while wearing them while wearingTheir uniform and that would make their game safer.
I agree, and I think the Saints would probbly use it to track the players too.  They would need to track their cheerleaders on the field as well, and track the locations of the cheerleaders.  I wonder how they would track the Locations of the players?
Yeah, they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as each other. That seems unfair and a strange rule, they should be allowed toEat at the same restaurants.
I agree, they can sue for discriminition if they want! I wonder how many NFL teams have the same rules like that, how many different NFL teams?
I'm not sure, but what I find most disturbing is that a player walks in on the other team and has to leave even mid meal if a team wants him to, and they don't even say why.
That is annoying and a waste of money. Do you ever read the Bible btw?
Do you enjoy sports?  I like sports.
I love it! I like the NFL. Did you hear about Tom Brady's health plan?
No, I didn't. I wonder if it will be in the new book?
No, he credits it with helping him to stay on top of the game with his method. I think it's helping him get the credits for that method.
I think he made a whole book about that! That's a new thing, is there a book?
I'm not sure. There was a good documentary called "Tom vs Time" that I watched. Watching it changed my view on him. I realized he doesn't care about work and he puts in the work to win alot. I have never realized that. After watching it, I have to say I have changed my point of view.
I think you have made your opinion on him change, thanks.
He really puts in the mental and physical work in the offseason.
That is amazing, but makes sense considering the effort people put in.
Yes.  Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0 in the highest scoring game in fooball in 1916.  I wonder what the highest scored game was in foobs?  Georgia tech beat Cumberlands 222- 0.
I wonder if the winning team was just really good or vice versa, I know that the winning is usually really good
Yes. lol  in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of the era.
Man how times have changed,
In the united states soccer is called football, but in other parts of the world it is called Football.
I did not know that. I wonder if they have football and american football confused all the time?
That's understandable.  Former Patriots RB benjarvus green-ellis never fumbled once in his NFL career.  That's a pretty impressive stat line...
Yes, it is.  Today the NFL even puts chips in players shoulderpads and the footballs to get data.
Crazy,  lol  The average actual gameplay in an NFL game is only 11 minutes.
I know that the dozen or so minutes ESPN has to let the audience digest the information easier than that. ESPN even won an emmy for making the yellow first down line easier to see.
Interesting. I never knew that. Did you know that there are 32 teams in the NFL? I never really knew that!
It's actually not an exact number but it seems like it. In any case, thanks for chatting with me about the exact number!
Football practiced by Tom Brady is like religion.  I wonder if the TV series "God" will go on for a while?
That is crazy. I guess he is passionate about football. I wonder what other people think about that. Did you know that Benjarvus Green-Ellis, a former Patriots player, never fumbled the ball in his entire career? I guess that is why he became a Patriots player.
That is rare.  I did not know that.  Brady seems to do well with his exercise for optimum life style and performance.  His wife likes to eat avocado ice cream.  Did you know that Brady and his wife eat avocado Ice Cream?
Sounds delicious!  Women are technically allowed to play football in the NFL.  I wonder why?
I suppose there would have to be a woman kicker some day.  I suppose that's why Gotham Chopra produced a series on Brady.  Talking about Tom versus Tom, did you know that Gotham ChopRA produced a "Tom vs. Tom" series on Tom versus the QB?
Nice!  ESPN won an Emmy for the implementation of that superimposed yellow line.  Did you know that?
I love that line.  Talking about the series we were talking about, Bill We Trust is a parallel religion.  Patriot coach and a patriot,  I love that.
I agree it is cultlike, there was a columnist for the Boston Globe who called it so.
I agree.  He was delivered to us by the best coach in history.  I've read that there are different versions of the real Bible, christian, catholic, jewish, etc.  But he is the only coach that has delivered it in all versions and he is a christian.
I have never read both bibles.  I don't think that Teddy Roosevelt or John Quincy Adams used them at their swearing in ceremony.  Did Teddy Roosevelt and John QuincyAdams use them?
I teach a little every week, but it seems odd that the New Testament is written in Koine Greek while Jesus and his disciples spoke Aramic. Did you know that? And the Christian bible is written entirely in Greek. I wonder why.
Did you know the tower of Babel is the building in Iraq they believed was the tower?  I wonder what it looks like.  It is known as the Tower of Babel.
I have seen photos, but no pictures, just some pictures in a container with a drawing and some photos of people.  I have seen Mandarin Mandarin people talk in a number of languages and talk about how God divided the number of the flood when he made the Noah Ark, and how the Noah's ark was going to ship it out of the mouth of the Flood, and the people on the ship were drawing it out as they were going to go.  So, it's possible that people are still talking about it years later in different languages.
That's a lot of information.  I recently learned the world apple and evil is called the malus in latin.  The bible was translated into latin when it was first translated.
That is a strange set of translations for an apple and a evil. Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the bible by cutting out the Bible by cutting it with a razor blade. That is a unique and strange set-up.
Wow, I wonder if he did things like that back when all the students were still required to study the bible in school.
That is awful. I wish that bill had never been. I don't like reading the bible in public schools. I wonder what direction the US will go in if it goes in this direction. Some states are trying to establish a religion of their own, and the government is trying to keep them from reading the Bible.
I wonder how much money top football players got. Bowlers made twice as much as the money topfootball players. In the 1960's bowlers made 20 times more.
I respect the marketing job that they did to make their product so valuable.  I don't know what would have been done without the pictures developed for the NFL in the 60s.  That was the time for the pictures, and I respect the Marketing job they did then to make theirs so valuable!
Yeah, technology has changed a bit since then.  There are tracking chips embedded in the shoulder pads and footballs to track what they do.
Technology makes us all better, nice chat!
Hi there, are you a football fan?
Not so much.  I do like watching NFL games, but am not familiar with NFL.  Are you?
I watch a little, but I don't have a favorite team, do you have a team you like to watch ?
I like the NFL, I live in San Francisco, where I belong.
The Pats have been a team that has fallen on hard times this year. I am a Hawks fan and the Patriots have had some winning streaks, but the team has not had a Brady or Belichick on it for a while. I don't have any feelings for them this year, they haven't had one in a while, and they are not on winning streaks either.
I do like Brady, and I thought he was really talented, but I'm not a fan of the Pats either, I thought they were talented but not that talented.
He is extremely talented, but the accusations of him being a hero fail.  The coach is a hero, not the QB.  What a herofail!
I heard that Brady is on a spiritual quest. I don't understand why he would go on a "spiritual quest" if he was on something like that.
I understand.  He's good at his football.  I don't know if he has a religion.
I wonder if he watch Facebook watch?  It's suggested he does.
I don't know.  I don't have a account or care for it.  Facebook is like a way for me to keep in touch with my kids but not really in touch.  Do you know Brady?
I wonder if he's just showing people what's going on in his life, or if he has something meaningful going on that he's showing off.  I am not a fan of his Facebook watch, but I can't say I'm a fan either.  Do you use Facebook watch?
I suppose it is good to seek spiritual awareness.  It's odd to think that on the football field, he is so odd to not see life's meaning.  Maybe he's good toseek spiritual awareness off the footballfield.
That is true, I know right, do you know how many teams are in the NFL league?
I believe there are 32 at the current time.  I think that the more the merrier, the more they expand.  It makes the teams have more parity which can lead to more interesting games at the present time. However, it will take a long time to get to parity.
I agree, it would be more competition, I think. I heard that the nfl has no written role against female players, and that team owners can tell the female players they are allowed to play if they want. I wonder if there is a written role from the team owners.
I think that there will be a women's league soon. I think that she is a tough woman, but boy is she a tough girl, no matter what they say. I can see a women in the women's game, but I don't see a men's league.
It would be hard for any female candidates to meet the league's eligibility requirements.  But I think that there are enough female candidates for a life time to keep joining the NFL in a life's time.  I think there are more female players than there are players that would be joining the league.
I would expect to see women players soon, but I am getting anxious to leave this old hill.  I would like to see a woman ref, maybe a women ref at least.
Well, apparently there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay in an average NFL game.  I'm surprised there's even 11 minutes in an Average NFL game!  I'd be surprised if there was more than 7 minutes of actual gameplay.
It makes sense. They stop it for a few plays and then they complete it, but then they stop again and the rest of the time is ads and huddles.
I guess that only 11 minutes of gameplay makes sense. Anyway, I've got to run. It was sincerely nice chatting with you.
Do you watch the NFL?
Hello, yes I do. Football is one of my favorite games. What about you?
Nice, did you know women can play too?
I didnt know that, I think its a game with alot of contact and I think it might be a bit unfair for woman, the fact that they can, seems like it would be a little bit unfair.
I think it would make the game more interesting, I think it could happen. It would makeThe game more exciting.
Football is a dangerous game and the difference in strength between the sexes can make me sick watching a man tackling a woman.  It would make me illnesses watching a guy tackling a women.  There is so much more to football than just the difference of strength.
Yeah that is a good point, there's only 11 minutes of game play in a game, so there is not that much to do!
That kind of sucks, seems unfair. I expect more than 11 minutes of gameplay in a game that lasts 3 hours. Tickets tend to be expensive too, and they are expensive, so it kind of suck, and tickets tend to get really expensive after 11 minutes.
Yeah, it is. Bowlers used to make more than football players though, in the 60s.
I think it changed, bowling was a popular sport, it was popular back in the day, now it doesnt seem like a very popular sport so maybe it changed.
Yeah football has definitely surpassed it, but engineers still make more money over the lifetime than they did in the 60s.
Engineers also make a bit of sense. Football players have short careers so that's good because they make a lot of money. Engineers also make A LOT of money, too.
True, have you heard of the rule about New Orleans cheerleaders?
Yeah, I think it is banned. It sounds really unfair. It is a sexist rule. The cheerleaders should sue the team for that.
In my opinion, it is the worst part, the fact that they have to leave mid meal if players walk in, and then they have have to also leave mid Meal if players leave.
That is a terrible rule, I hope they change it in the future, it is humiliating and it is a really terrible rule.
I hope so too.  On another topic, do you like the Bible?
I am not really religious but I know it is a sacred book. It is the word of god.
I like the bible. I like the facts that are part of the education system.
I think that is a good thing that was part of the current education system, it gives choice and not religion is a part of it, but I think religion is still a choice in the current Education system.
I totally agree with you. I think they are free to decide what they want to choose but we should be free to deciding what we want to decide.
do you watch the NFL?
I do, I am a patriots guy, I like Tom Brady, what about you?
He is my favorite player. He is also a book author.
Yeah the Athlete's Bible that is making its rounds, have you read it?
Did you ever watch the TV documentary series Tom vs. Time?
I did not know that women can play in the NFL. I wonder if that would be fun for real?
Yes as long as they meet the requirements.
I am not sure, I would be curious to see. I think they are sticking to engineering careers.
Maybe! Engineers make way more over their lifetime, so I can't blame them.
I know bowlers used to make more than them, they make more in the 60s
Things have changed so much.  Did you hear about the tracking chips used on players?
Yes and a bunch of other ways they are collecting information like their velocity and rotation, etc
I don't know.  I just hope it can help make the game safer and decrease the number of concussions.
I would like that as well.  Amazing how on another topic but about the bible, do you like the Bible?
I do know that they have sold over 4 billion copies, that is an amazing record, I think it has sold over 5 billion copies by now
I know right, it is one of the most influential books in the world.
yup. Jefferson created his own version of the bible, a version of it that was different
Yes he used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts of the Bible
Yeah.  Did you know that Roosevelt and Quincy was the only two presidents to not swear in that did not swear them in?
I wonder why that was.  It should be part of the curriculum in school for all nonreligious people to use.  I don't think it needs to be.
I'm glad that is a pretty recent one. I think religion should be a choice and not a choice. I'm glad not everyone has to be anymore.
Hi, do you watch the NFL?
Hello, how are you? Yes, I watch NFL games. What about you?
Nice, me too. Did you know women can play too?
Yes they can play against 250-300 lb men, so it must be safe.
Yeah, that must be rough.  Did you know there is only 11 minutes of active game play in a game?
I read that.  I wonder how they divided up the quarters?  Is it divided by two math and time?
It does take into account the active game play though.  I think that is probably the case since the running, running, and playing take into consideration.
Hahaha, it does take too long to eat a meal, in my opinion.  It takes longer than eleven minutes for the active game play, and longer than 11 minutes for them to eat.
Yeah, me too. ESPN won an Emmy.
I had no idea! I wonder why? I know there was the beginning of NFL before espn, but did you know that?
I don't know, but I do know that when they invented the yellow line it made our game watching easier
I agree and I can sit on my sofa and just sit and look at the line and not focus on the team. I think the line is so important but I do not agree with the whole "come on team" focus.
Yeah. Do you know what the highest score in NFL game was?
I can't remember what it is, who was playing?
222-0 and Georgia Tech.  They crush Cumberland.
222-0 was college football, not the NFL.  Georgia Tech vs Cumberland?
Ooops my bad! That was a win for Georgia Tech! So on another topic, do you believe in the Bible?
I do, I read a lot of verses in the Bible, pretty good I think I've only read one psalm and that is the last psalam, what about you?
I like it too! It was part of the educational system for many years in the US.
I did not know that. Did you know Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible?
Yeah the guy used a razor to cut those parts that were supernatural and then used a knife or a razor for the supernatural.
Wow. Did you know Apple was the first to have the bible translated into Latin and it was the 1st to do so?
Yeah.  I think it's coincidental that Malus is the name of both Apple and Evil.
Hi, are you a football fan?
I am not really. Are you?
I watch sometimes. I hear Brady is using a new method and I hear it has some changes, do you watch him?
Yeah I think he has a book on that, I have read that,  but I guess it seems like he is pretty successful with that book,  I have not read it though.
I havent read it, but I do know that his method even includes lots of avocado ice cream.  His method even Includes lots of Avocado ice cream
I have not tried that.  I can't imagine it.
I would. I like avocado and guac.
If I can eat avocado ice cream, I'll eat it too.  I'd just spoon or scoop it with Doritos.
Doritos would also make a nice topping.
I think they could add a little salsa.  They could put that on the market and get it on there to add to the market.
That could be our ticket to fame. That way we could make our millions.
It is a ticket.  People who make it big just fall into it by accident, like these days.  It is not something you get on accident.
Most make it honestly by talent.  Green-Ellis never once fumbled in his career.
He did? the guy is an accomplishment.  I wonder if he ever did rock climbing,  I know that there is a rope at the end of the rope that is used for rock climbing.
He is an awesome pair of hands.  I would want him with the ball for sure.  Brady is the best QB on the Patriots.
He is, but the other person is the best QB on the team, right?
It does, Bill we trust you is a good leader, that is his motto, and a good one at that, we trust in you, that's our motto
I am constantly amazed by the team that wins. I think sports has that intangible ingredient that helps the team. I wonder if that's why it's the team with the best team that win.
Brady is the Messiah.  He's the "messiah" of all fans.
I would argue he is, he has been a success, but he is only 30.
True.  And there are tons more like him.  Great chat!  I have to get going.  Good night,  have a good night!
You have a good night as well!
Football is a great sport and a religion and a great sports.
Agreed. It is a religion to many and many worshippers on sunday find relief through football, a sport that is a sport.
I love Sundays, I belong to a group that likes football, do you have a favorite team? or group?
I do not have a favorite. I usually root for the underdog in the super bowl. I do that out of spite. What about you? Do you have a least favorite?
I do too! I hate the Patriots but I want them to win. The underdog is always my favorite.
I think they are well advised not to be powered by hatred, they always win.  It is nefarious and it is not what you want to win.
Brady is so great, he is going to give it his all.
Brady is the power, but the crux of it is that the team must fall into a bibiical prophecy. The rest of the team can never be Brady. The team must be the bibiicals prophecy of the power.
I think that is a profecy that will not be fulfilled, but the team will be better off with him.  The Patriots are still a competitive team in the NFL, and the NFL is not a competitive league.
It should be.  I expect that the NFL will have a "Time of reckoning" for all teams, in terms of the truth as told in the book of revelation "The Truth, the truth, and the Truth"  I think that is what we all expect of the book "The Book of Revelation"  In terms of all teams.  The truth as it should be, and truth as truth.
It is hard to believe the Patriots have a great coach, he is a great Coach
I figure Bill has the power to do it.  The Secret to winning is a prophecy.
I havent heard of that profecy but it does illustrate something that I havent seen.
I'm told that they were leaders pure of heart and true to their word would lead teams to victory on the field of battle. Cross, cross, cross....gold to those leaders pure, who would lead team to victory.  They were leaders of the heart and True to their Word.
Wow that sounds like an interesting story. I will have to read more about it, I really like Bradys books, tru is a very interesting story, have you read any of his books?
I have not.  I think that Bill will reveal that it is not true, I don't think that the prophecy of the patriots is going to be completely true.  Maybe the prophecy is just for the Patriots.
That sounds interesing, there is a lot to that prophecy.
I am not a true follower of the NFL prophecy, but I am an acolyte of the truth and have never understood it. I hope that the Super Bowl shows that the NFL is being understood.
I hope we get to see the next superbowl, I can't stand the Patriots so I hope not.
I hope not again.  That prophecy will not be fulfilled this time.  It has been a prophecy since the 60s.
Thank God for the NFL bless you!
Hey there! Are you a football fan?
I love football!  How about you?
I watch sometimes, how about you?
Are you a Tom Brady fan?  I am.  He is basically the best QB ever by book.  I like him because he basically follows the bible.
No I am not but I am interested to read it, he does sound like he is extreme at the times, do you think it is interested toread?
I agree lol. Do you have a favorite team? If so, who is your favorite team ?
I root for the Dolphins, they are a family thing.
Yikes...lol, I hear you.  I am a Vikings fan, but this year we really blew it.  The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of gameplay.  Yikes!  They should try to do something more than that.  LOL
I did not know that, it seems sooo long for only 11 minutes to happen.
It is sooo long with all of the timeouts, half time, and commercials, and the commercials at the half time.  Engineers make more money overtime than NFL players.
That is good to hear, I wish more people knew about that.  I think it is a focused program to help the world and that is good.  Good to hear.
Engineers developed chips to track data in shoulder pads of NFL players.
I did not know that.  That is so neat, and so cool.  It's hard to believe that they have all that data.  I wonder what they do with all thatData.
Do you have a favorite college football team?
Yes, I root for Florida State.
I like the Iowa Hawkeyes.  One of my favorite growing up.  They have pink locker rooms for visiting teams.
That must be a shock for people when they walk in.
Yes, I think it's for calming their opponents down. They have an upper advantage from that. I wonder if it has to do with psychology stuff or if it is just for calming them or something.
Yes, I think that is a big part of the game as well.  They come back from losses and stuff like that.
It was great chatting!  Thanks!
Same here!  Have a good night!
Are you a fan of the NFL?
Hi there, I am a fan of the NFL!  How about you?
I am not a fan, but I watch a few of the games. Did you know that women can play too?
Yes there is a league that has a female player in it, do you know who?
I think I do too.  They put in only 11 minutes of game play though
11 minutes? for reasons I dont know, I guess I like Brady and the game is only 11 minutes, he has to be in the game for the reasons I don't like Brady
Yeah, he was the author of a book, the legend of Patriots, a book.
He is a football legend, not only a writer but a very smart person and a very very smart writer.
I guess so!  He surely loves lots of avocado ice cream, so he stays healthy.
I would not think avocado on the ice cream would be a healthy meal choice, but it worked out for him.  I guess if you're a pro player you need to have a healthy diet, and avocado is a good way to get that, ice cream is definitely a healthy eat choice.
Yup you're right. Do you know what the highest score ever was for a football game?
I do not know what the highest score in a game of football is, what is the highestscore?
222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland!  That's the game of the century!
That is so humiliating!  I wonder if they ever fight back a result like that.  How can you fight back that much.
Yeah, and they are using tracking chips in the players for the games now, I wonder if the tracking chips are used in the games too
They are. I heard they use the chips things like velocity, rotation and location of the footballs, game plan, rotation, and precision of the chips Things that provide unique stats for each game.
That is pretty advanced. On another topic, do you know much about the bible?
Yeah, I'm not really a religious person, but I do know that the Bible is a collection of sacred texts which is a word of God and is aCollection of sacredtexts
I've heard some of this stuff.  It's a part of our education system.
I think that is unfair for kids from different religious backgrounds. religion shouldnt be a mandatory thing for everyone. seems unfair.
I think it should be a choice for the bible, Jefferson apparently created his version of the bible.
Jefferson was a very smart person. I wonder if he had the original version or if he came up with his own. He was a smart person for sure.
Good morning! Are you a football fan?
I am a football fan. Are you?
I am a fan. ESPN won an Emmy for creating the yellow superimposed first down line on tv.
Yeah, I heard about that!  That's pretty cool!
It is.  I wonder if they relax on the field?  Did you know the University of Iowa's visitors locker room was painted completely pink?  That way they can relax on their field.
Yeah, I wonder how that works. I suspect that it makes the other team more angry and it works.
I wonder if it would possibly be inspiring for them, lol. It could be for breast cancer awareness, or just to possibly be encouraging.  I know the highest score ever in a football game was 222 to 0, which was the highest scored ever in one!
I do not, but it was 222-0, that is a wild guess.
It was in New England, I believe.  What a blowout!  Did you know that Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his NFL career?
Interesting, I wonder how many times he did it, maybe because he was a running back?
I don't know. Football is a game that a player can play for a long time, great ones fumble a few times a year, but the best player can plays for a while and then fumble a long, long time.
Yeah, it's pretty crazy! Did you know an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent?
That is crazy!  I wish I could sign up to be on that cell phone.  I can't lol  If you do, Unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you don't use your cell phone,  I wonder how much they will donate?  I know UniceF will donate 1 day ofClean Water to aChild for every second you do not use your phone.
That's very interesting.  Jupiter has radio storms that can be heard on AM radio.  I've never heard them before.
I didn't know that, that is cool.
Do you know how the station got its name?
I'm not sure, but according to Canadian radio law, it is!
No, what is that?
It says 40 percent of the music played has to be by Canadian artists, which is kind of neat.
Interesting, naturally I would listen to it more, I'm not sure why though. It was so nice chatting with you!
I have had a good time! Have a great day!
Are you a fan of a quarterback, Brady or a fan at all?
I'm not really a fan, though I admire his skill and level of devotion.  I don't call him the best QB ever.  He has six super bowl rings, which doesn't hurt, but I admire him for his skill, and I admirehis skill andlevel of devotion, too!
I like football. I think a bit of his accomplishments are a mystery to me though. I don't know too much about him. Is there a mystery behind his accomplishments?
Ben has been a really good quarterback for a long time, they have a good system and a good quarterback and a reallygood QB in a good team.
My understanding is that his team is disliked by many and his team has some jealousy.
I believe it is because people suspect his team has cheated, but I have not seen proof for that.
I wonder if his book will be the one method that gets the market to buy into the method.
Nah,  I have never read his book,  but i think that i will look into it.  I dont really need his advice,  the man makes enough money with his own method.  Do you read his books?
I'm fascinated to find out bowlers used to make more than footballers in the sixties. I'm sure Tom was very grateful to have come of age in a lucrative era.
I know right, he was a long named player never fumbled once, thats quite the accomplishment
Pro footballers are set for life with money.  I guess that's why they are stars.  The average player will make less than an engineer in their working life, while pro footballers can make more.  But I guess the average player would be set forlife with money, if not for the working life.
They tend to have 4 year careers and pay a lot in taxes, so it is not like that.
I hope that they take advantage of the local community though. Some students have to go to college with debt, but if they can get their doors open to the local college and get the help of other students who have finished their first year, then they might be able to take advantage and go to another college with the same debt.
Generally, business based off of reputation is the best way to start a new business.
I am interested to see the promotion thing with the documentary about them. I hear there is content that is better than Brady and I would be interested to hear.
I honestly dont know,  I would be interested in hearing stories from his teammates and coaches.  I am interested in hear stories from him though.
I do enjoy hearing people talk about the past and the present. It gives a truer picture. I think I enjoy hearing the latter more.
I know, high expectations and what some call "high standards" isnt a bad thing in football, but sometimes high expectations can be a bad way to go about it. Are Belichick good leaders?
Yes, they carry themselves well, but eventually time catches up to them.  It's a difference of a few years, but in a few more years, the avocado ice cream making will be a carry over.
I think his biggest problems are getting injured and getting injured again.  He doesnt like taking hits.  avocado ice cream sounds good.  I don't know about you, but avocado ice CREAM sounds good!
Ice cream? When I was young I eat it sometimes, but I can't say that my imagination makes up what it would taste like.
Haha, good chatting with you too!
Do you watch the NFL?
Hello, yes I do. Do you have a favorite player?
I do like Tom Brady, he is a very well rounded player, he seems like a well rounded person
He is, he is also a book author, that is nice.
Yeah he wrote The Athlete's Bible, I heard its really good, he used the "Athlete's BIBLE" method, have you read it?
I haven't read it either. I am looking forward to seeing it. I also want to read the new documentary Tom vs Time, that he did. Have you seen it?
What is your favorite ice cream flavor?
I hear it has an avocado which makes sense as he is so health conscious.
Did you know women can play for the NFL?
Yes they can as long as they meet the requirements. Engineers get paid more though.
That is pretty interesting I guess a career in engineering is for everyone.
Yes, it could be. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
Yes that is Georgia Tech beating Cumberland 222-0 in a game in 1916
Man that is insane, I wonder if they ever had one of those. ESPN won an emmy for that one.
I believe it was for the superimposed yellow line, but I don't think they deserve it.
Yes I bet it sure did, it made watching the game at home much easier and understandable.
yup pretty much. Did you know that Iowa painted their visitor locker room pink? I wonder what that's supposed to mean.
Yeah, I wonder what the reason behind that is. Do you know what Benjarvus Gree-Ellis is?
Yes he was a former Patriots RB who never fumbled the ball.
Yup, he is a legend. I wonder why they used tracking chips in the players now to do that, I know players use them now
No but I can see them collecting information like their velocity and rotation and other such. Pretty cool.
I hope they can use it to make the game safer.
Do you watch the NFL?
I do watch it, sometimes.  How about you?
From time to time.  Curious fact is that The U of Iowa visitor locker room is painted pink.
That's funny, I wonder if it was to humiliate their opponents?
I think it is.  It worked to keep them off their heads and distract them.
ha-ha, I'm guessing it doesn't, they have a good team, and they are not the best, ha-ha.  I think it's weird that in the 60s bowlers used to make more than NFL stars, I wonder why that changed, I guessing because of the bowlers, weird.
It has changed, I think engineers make more money over the lifetime than they used to, engineers make even more now!
I wonder what color was the visiting locker room was when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0 back in 1916. I know Georgia tech beat CumberLAND 222- 0 back in 1912 and they didn't have any color in the visiting's locker room.
Wow, that was a huge defeat! It couldn't have been anything worse than pink! Did you hear about that strange rule about the New Orleans cheerleaders? It's a strange rule, but I don't know what else to say about it.
What on earth is up with that rule?  Makes no sense.  Is it a superstition thing?  Why on earth have a rule?
It's weird and the worst part is that the player walks in and has to leave mid meal.
Yeah that is odd, and also that the NFL uses tracking chips on the players before and after the game.
Yeah I think they track velocity, rotation, rotation. I wonder if they track Velocity too. I hope they use the data to make the game less dangerous.
Safety is a big concern. There is a lot of standing around in a game that has only 11 minutes of action. There's not much to do in the way of standing, just a lot in the first few minutes ofaction.
That sure is.  I know I am glued to the TV for so long.  Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
No I don't who is he?
The Patriots? The guy has never fumbled the ball in his career?
Man, that is one heck of an accomplishment, the only other guy in NFL history to ever make that claim, and he was the only guy in nfl history to do that, what an accomplishment!
Pretty cool. On another topic, do you know much about the Bible?
I do know that Thomas Jefferson created his own version of it.
yeah he removed all the supernatural things, nice chatting with you.
Hey! Were you aware of the using the method by Tom Brady?
I do know who Tom Brady is, he recently won the Super Bowl, what about you?
He sounds like he is trying to do marketing for himself.  I was wondering if its a good idea to buy books like the Athlete's Bible.  It sounds like it might be a good Idea to buy a book that will help you with daily life.  You know, like how to get met and all.
He is a good quarterback but apparently some fans call him the messiah and say that the book has cultist aspects to it.
Are you a football fan at all?
Yes, I really enjoy football. I like that the bye is only during the regular weeks.
Yes, and I'm surprised that's one of the reasons why regular season is only 11 weeks. 17 regular seasons are only 11.
As long as it's the last Super Bowl and they play for so long. I heard it's going to be Tom vs. Time, to show Tom vs..Time.
I have heard of it, but never watched it, have you?
No not yet, sounds interesting, but there is too much conflicting information. The book seems a bit cultist, like they are trying to get everyone to like the book.
I honestly haven't seen it either, honestly. The highest score ever in a football game was 222-0.
Yeah, that was back in 1916, back when it was just college or professional, I've heard that.
Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland.  I can't imagine the game.
lol, can you imagine the bus ride home?  Iowa state painted their visiting locker room pink.  lol
Good point about ride home. It's funny they did that, they were the only team to achieve that in a month. I have no idea how the team could even achieve that. It is funny that the locker room is pink color, but I understand the point about rides. stay home, stay home!
I guess it is some kind of psychological thing. Hey, at least the point made, I guess. Hey did you know bowlers used to be top NFL players?
I have no idea, that is funny, but I think it is funny.  I think I am surprised that the lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than NFL player's lifetime earning. I am not sure how much more important they would be to society if the players make a lot of money.  But, I am happy to see that they make so much money and happy to be surprised that it is higher.
Yes, I agree they are more important for the society.  But if you give the choice to anyone, it would be them.  I would think they would take the millions to be more important.  It would give the option to be useful for society.
Sounds reasonable!  Quick question, do you read bible?
I do not, but I do like King James.
I like them too.  It was nice to chat with you, have a good one.
You too!  I will read the bible again!  It is a good read,  divine inspiration of God written by men,  but also divine inspiration by the men too,  its a good book.
Are you a Pats fan?  I've been following football for a few years, but I haven't been a Pats Fan for a while.
I watch a few games per season.
I love or hate it I like it, my favorite player is Tom Brady, I don't doubt his dedication to the game, love orhate it but I can't doubt that his dedication.
Very true. I heard he once wrote an "Athlete's Bible" for the sport.
Did you know that Pats running back Benjarvus Green Ellis has made his life mission to play his entire career for the Pats?
He played at the same time as Tom Brady.
I don't know if I could trust him as a coach.  I would not trust a QB.  He has a coach, Bill Belicheck who hates fumbles and would bench a player for a game due to it.
That's true, it's a good thing he was the coach for Cumberland back in 1916, they tolerated losing by 222 points so it's probably a good way to get a coach.
Hey, so what do you think about the University of Iowa painting the visiting locker room pink?
I think that's funny! I wonder if that is to deter the other team from trying to get in there or to deter them from trying?
True, but it is better to laugh and forget.  I do love the yellow line on football tv games though.  ESPN invented it, which makes it so much easier to see, and I think it makes it much more true.
I had heard that.  That is a nifty invention.  They were even voted in for an emmy.
Did you know that the NFL has no rule against woman players as long as they meet eligibility requirements, woman would be allowed to play.
I don't think so, I think it would be cool if they had no rule, I don't know if there was a brave woman that would try it but I don' t want to see it.
I heard there is a female kicker.
That would be awesome!  That could make history in my lifetime!  I would like to be an engineer so I could make History!
That's pretty silly. It's also ridiculous that a New Orleans Saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a New Saints player comes in, but it's not like she had to leave if she didn't want to be with the player. I wonder why she had her cheerleader's rights taken away?
I think the past problem with the rule caused by the rule was a solution to a past problem, not a solution for the new problem, the NFL player.
I'm not sure that was the only solution, but the solution to some problems is always the same, separating one group from another.  It's like how we're still treating the "lower class" or "lower classes" of the NFL.  I was surprised to learn recently that an NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  That seems like so little considering that there's only 11 minutes in an NFLGame!
I guess they have to take calls and breaks and such.  I think the game could be quite a bit longer if it were a bit shorter.  Maybe they would go into overtime, but I guess not.  Too many calls and broke.
True!  It's been good talking to you.
It has been fun learning new things about football!
Me too.  Do you know what a bye is?
Hi there! Great chat lined up with you! Do you like NFL football?
Hi my friend! I love the game I really love the players so yeah, they have the potential and I love how much they love the player and love the games potential, what about you?
I have great faith in football.  I like the NFL and think it's the greatest incarnation of the fulfillment of prophecy, the fulfillment, or fulfillment of prophecies, in the NFL, of the Great "Greatest Incarnation".
It is interesting how different the sport is from the US sport. I like Tom Brady, what about you?
Yes Tom Brady is the coach of the New York Patriots, I do not know who his coach is though
Yes he is.  I think the Patriots have had him as one of their players for a while now.
I guess he does have a pretty good arm, he can throw for over 300 yards once, he could throw for more than 2000 yards.
I dont know, he has a mechanic arm, so he might have a mechanic's arm!  But he has his own way of doing it,  I dont think he has the lot of fans for a messiah look though lol
Maybe so! He's like the messiah of the bible, my friend.
He doesn't, but he does use it as a metaphor.  I saw an interesting documentary called Tom vs Time.  It was behind the scenes content.
To be fair, Tom's time is practically elderly, so I guess this Tom guy picks his fights metaphorically... He probably has a lot of the same fight with Father Time, and I guess Tom's guy picks a lot more fights metaphoric...
Yeah, I hear you.  I don't recall him doing that at any point.  Did you hear about that player of the Patriots that never fumbled the ball, or any player for that matter?  He was a RB for the Patriots in 2001, he never fumbles the ball.
I agree with you on that point, I thought those guys were paid a lot of money to never fumble the ball and I thought they did a better job than that, but I agree, those guys are paid a LOT of money.
Fumbling the ball is a hard thing to do, too bad. I wonder what position he used to play. I can't recall seeing him play. It's a position I don't recall him ever doing.
I don't follow the game very good, I guess I don't understand the game Very good.  There's even a Bible about football in there.  I guess it says that players throw, catch, kick and kick and they have fumbled the ball?  I thought there was only one where the players throw.
Football is definitely an interesting game, but there are many negative things about it.  There are only 11 minutes of live gameplay per match.
I figure that there should be more than 11 minutes, that would make the players play for more than just 11 minutes.
That's an odd fact. Football has so many hours in a game.  13 minutes of gameplay seems unreal.  I guess the games tend to have a lot of breaks so the games can go on for hours.  The odd fact is that games tend not to last more than 2 hours.
I think those guys want to make the game four hours so that they can make the games last. 11 minutes of play doesn't seem like much.
I love football a game of that many teams, I guess its a great game, I like how its has 2 divisions, 3 teams in each, 4 divisions and so much football agame
It is a tremendous game, but tremendously confusing!  I have scant knowledge about it, but I know a little.  I know it's good to know about it from the Bible, but not much else.  It's a tremendous, if you ask me, tremendous game.
Hello there, are you familiar with the NFL?
I know a little bit about the NFL.  I like the true star Tom Brady.  Do you know him?
I have a passing knowledge of football, and you?
The patriots and tome brady specifically defy time and logic with so many Super Bowl wins.
They are the Lannisters of football, for some reason
They have a mantra, "Do their job, pay their debts, and do your team's, then do your own" mantra.
The patriots are doing a job of winning phenomenally.
It's kind of weird that people root for their team, but it's also kind of Weird that people Root for the Patriots banner and pray for the game and not their team.
Yes, and fans are dedicated to sports and enjoy it more when they do.
Georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0. I wonder if cumberlands fans enjoyed that game.
I wonder too, I would be laughing so hard if I were Georgia Tech.
I would laugh so hard too! I think that is the spirit of the game. I wonder if Deepak Chopra approve?
I don't know who Deepak Chopra is, I don't think he would.
He is the guy making Tom Bradys TV show and the father of the guy who is the guru from India, the guru's from India.  He can play the whole game, live, in a game.  I know that the NFL only has 11 minutes of a game, but the guy in Tom Brady's TV show only got to play for about 10 minutes.
That's a good thing. Living right is subjective. I understand that laughing at yourself is a failure but if you were losing due to a lack of practice, living right means you are not only losing but also losing because you were untrained and not on your team. It's not a failure to lose any sleep over it, it's a lack to practice.
Yes, I suppose that is relevant.  Funny how time moves on.  Tom Brady is the foot ball messiah, the footBall Messiah, but the Lannisters of the 30 years old.  But, I think Tom Brady will always be relevant.
He's keeping amazingly fit for his age and in the Super Bowl.
I think Tom has to keep competing for the life of him. It would give him some longevity and his drive to keep on competing. I wonder if he thinks it has a bearing on his longevity.
I think it shows the strength of mind as well as dedication.
He is very dedicated. There is no rule against the football with female players.
I think there is a female league that will start soon, I think it is too dangerous to try it though, but maybe they will start one soon. I think the gender difference are similar to differences in weight class. In any case thanks for chatting and in case you need to try out for the female league, I know the gender differences inweight class can be dangerous.
How's it going, do you read much? It's not uncommon for American students to be required to read from the Bible as part of their education.
Hi. Thanks for the chat I don't know much about the Bible, I'm not religious but I do believe in god and I think students were required to read from the Bible.
There are all kinds of interesting facts, like the reason why the word "malus" came to mean apple and evil was only known when the Bible was translated into Latin in the 5th century, the reason it was "malu" is an interesting coincidence, apple and good are both associated with apple and  evil, interesting facts
That is interesting. I think it's interesting that the Bible a collection of sacred texts that Jew's and Christians use.  I think I'll read it more.
I know why the Jews consider it a holy book.  The books in the bible are called the pentateuch,  and the books of the bible  are called The Ten Books.
Apparently Thomas Jefferson created a different version of the Bible, one that cut out the supernatural parts, such as miracles and the resurrection.
I wonder if any presidents have tried to use religion in humanist terms, like Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams did.  Teddy Roosevelt did. He wanted to keep the bible in the constitution, but he wanted things like religion in the Constitution.
I read that too.  I did not know that about the presidents and I did wonder about that reason.  Thanks for the clarification on the bible used at swearing-in ceremonies.
Well, the role of government as separate from the Bible and its long history and tradition, and the role and the roles of the government as independent. It is a long history.
It is understandable that there is a separation between religions and government, the constitution says that the US Constitution is the bible but there are presidents that have gone against the separation between religious and government which is not understandable.
I agree, they wanted to make their role clear.
Apparently, the biblical tower of babes is based on a real building, the etemenanki in modern-day Iraq. It was based on the real building "the tower of Babel".
The story probably made sense because it was true back in the day, and it is a real tower, but I don't think it would have been true back then, but the story probably making sense.
Are you familiar with the NFL?
Hi!  I'm a little bit.  I know the NFL has a rule against female players, but I'm surprised that women have not been allowed to play.  If they met the league's eligibility requirements they would be allowed in the NFL.  Do you know if there are any women in the league?
I think there will be female NFL players in my lifetime.  I think football is too physical and the physical is too much for them, but who knows?
I am surprised we haven't seen more woman get into the sport.
That's true, do you watch NFL football games?
I do watch them, especially the superbowl, do you watch?
I watch football games sometimes, I watch some games with my son but he doesn't like to watch it.
It is a very interesting sport and a good shared interest between a parent and child.  Good shared interest.  Thanks for the chat!
Yes,  it is,  especially if you are teaching it in the history of bible or something.  Nice chatting with you too!
Hello. Did you know the visiting locker room is pink?
No, I did not know that.  I'm a Patriots fan, how about you?
I like football and the Patriots. I don't like Tom Brady but he has a weird obsession with avocado ice cream.
lol Apparently some people follow him to the point where it's like a religious experience, weird.  Tom Bray is a QB,  I like him,  but he is not my QB, lol
That is crazy! He has a copy of Thomas Jefferson's bible!
Oh gosh I hope so! I wonder if the NFL has a written rule againsr female players in the league? The NFL has no written ruleagainsr female player in the NFL.
Good thing there are not many female players in the league!  Soccer sure pays well.  Cheerleading is where most girls go.  They are kickers on high school teams and even cheerleading for the Saints.
Yeah I know. They leave you and you are like, "Rediculous, I'll leave you"
Me either.  Makes you wonder what they're trying to do with all the tracking chips they use on the shoulderpads of the cheerleaders and the football players.
Hahaaaaa... yeah I think so... I wonder if they have cell phones too!
I think it's crazy that engineers earn more over a working lifetime than most football players.  I think parents are really pushing their kids to be baller.  Engineers earn more than football players and yet they are still pushing themselves to be better.
I know, I think that football players are the future, they plan for the future.
Apparently not.  In the 60s pro bowlers made more than them.
I think it is funny how football players went from being underpaid to overpaid to being under paid to over paid in such a short period of time. It is funny to think that we went from underpaid and overpaid football players so quickly.
That's even weirder than that.  ESPN won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow line.
That doesn't surprise me at all. The yellow line changed the game and the viewer immensely!
I guess it does, considering there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game!
That is true, it is one of the craziest stats, and it is all from game time play!
I can't imagine that in my high school games.  It's weird that depak chopra named his son gotham on the side, that's so creative, and weird that Depak Chopra named the son gOTHam, I can't even imagine who that is!
Depak Chopra? I did not know that.
I don't know who he is. I know he is on CNN a lot though. Thanks for chatting with me, have a lovely day.
You too! Thanks! :)
Are you a football fan? I am. Do you like Tom Brady?
I do, Tom Brady is one of the best of all time, do you like him?
Yes, he was the best back in his class.  Back in the day, Tom wrote something called Athlete's Bible!  It's called Athletic Bible.  He honestly got so many reps with Drew Henson that he got his starting position on the back of it.  I think he was spliitin in the time he was in the weight room getting reps.  Tom wrote that he would be a better QB today than anyone today.
I did not know that either, I imagine alot of those on top of the game use that method of staying in shape, do you think it is the best way to stay on top and in shape for the game?
He seems to be a deep thinker these days.  I think that is one of the answers to everything in his life.  He is a deep thinkers these days!
A 4th round draft pick, the odds stacked up a bit against him.  Now a surefire hall of famer.  He's got the odds stacking up to be a sure fire hall of Famer.
Yes. I watched him play at Michigan. He did.  Coach Belichick has also won 4 Super Bowls so it is no easy accomplishment.
That is true. He has done some amazing things over the years. He dresses up as a homeless person to help players. That is very true.
I wonder what it was like living in Big Ten country?  Living in Big Tenth country, the Iowa Hawkeyes pink visiting locker room early on and seeing the walls in posters of the Iowa hawkeyes pink visit to the visiting locker rooms.
I'm guessing the pink is meant to mess with the visiting team.  That is a strange tradition.
I had no idea the NFL had any rules against female players! I have no idea. I have also no idea there are any rulesagainst female players. I can't even imagine, but a defensive end would kill the poor thing.
If they are eligible, they would have to be able to have a strong enough physical condition to compete and have been signed by a team, and be eligible to be eligible.
I noticed the other day in the reading section they had mixed sports and religion and football.  They also had a mixed sports/religious book.  The best selling book of all time in the south is actually the bible which I think is one of the biggest deals of all.  I'm sure it's not in the best selling books in the US right now.
I know from personal experience and have been in the South myself, I can confirm that football is religion in the south.
Yes, it is.  The southern experience is so crazy, like the Rams robbing the Saints in the Super Bowl.  New Orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any player during the Superbowl, and the Rams cheerleaders were able to go in the restaurant after.
If the cheerleaders are eating at a restaurant, they have to leave if the players come into the restaurant, but if the cheerleader is in the restaurant they cannot leave?
I find it hard to believe that an engineer has higher earnings over the lifetime than an NFL player. I mean, if an engineer gets the league minimum they still get more, while an NFL Player gets the League minimum.
I wonder how much the engineer will earn. It figures that the NFL will pay, since players on average only play a couple of years in the NFL and then the engineer or an engineer will earning more.
I agree, I know some guys will play until they are 55 years of age, and after that they can work until a player is 55 years old, and then retires.  Tom Brady is one of them, he retires at 55 years.  I think we achieved our goal and now we have Tom Brady for a player.  Thanks for chatting and we can get to work.
Yes, and if he became an engineer, he'd have roughly $32 million in lifetime NFL earnings, an average career of 16 years, and lifetime NFL Earnings of $53 million over 8 years, or roughly $28 million after 16 years.
Do you think the league's minimum is more than the league minimum?  I don't mind that.
I think the majority of players in the NFL are on practice squads or are backups, not to mention they are on the league minimum.
Tom Brady is a fan of avocado ice cream, wanting to try it. I wonder if he is a Fan of Avocado ice cream?
No, I don't but it sounds good. The fact that an extremely popular quarterback eats it makes it even more attractive.
Unlike Brady. I'm more of an avocado fan, but guac a la guac does sound interesting. Not unlike Brady, who is an athlete bible.
Interesting. I think the Chopra documentary is a book.
I guess that's possible. Brady has so many friends that his father named him Gotham, I guess he and his father were friends and his dad named him gotham.
Yes, totally, Tom Brady is a spiritual figure for sure. He has a spiritual experience, and football is a very spiritual figure as well.
Honestly, I can't believe the way the Saints treat their cheerleaders, they are permitted to dine in the same restaurant as the players. I know that they are not permitted to be with them, but that seems totally archaic. The narcissism factor is another factor, I think, and the way that the Saints Treat their cheerleader's, it's narcissistic.
Yeah I agree with you totally, they can't sit at the same table as them.
I wonder if the NFL will ever have any rules about women players. As long as they meet the requirements, I think we will see women players in the NFL.
The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in America. It has been very eventful in history. Women did join the other major professionalsports leagues in the 1960s.
Did you know that in the 60s pro bowlers made more than a football player?  In the 60's pro bowl players made twice as much!
Personally, I'm curious why.  I'm not sure.  But, a columnist for the Boston Globe thinks Brady's book is creepy, and he is a football player.  The columnist, Boston Globe's "Empire of the Weird" columnist, says Brady'sbook is creepy.
I agree with the columnist on that one. It's insane that ESPN won an emmy for superimposing a yellow line on the globe, but the worship of football players has become a cult following that's for sure. I wonder why that was an Emmy for the columnist.
I expected that from a columnist from the Boston Globe, Brady is a good football player and a spiritual figure, but not a good writer, not a great one.  I think Brady is more of a "good" football player, and the columnist is not.
I guess he did know about the deflate gate, the tracking chips in the footballs, and the tracking in the tracking chip in his footballs
They should have!  I think it's interesting that football is used in different regions, and different countries and different things.  Soccer is the same in most countries but it's known as soccer in different region.
Yes. American football has a little less than 11 minutes of live gameplay, though.
Yeah, that is amazing.  It is amazing how much time of game play it takes up.  The games are so memorable, but I think they are too short.
Yes and to blend in in the pink lockerroom which is perfect for relaxation.
I think so too, but it's not as memorable that highest score in a football game ever was 222 to 0. I wonder how memorable that was?
That was a Georgia Tech game.  Thanks for chatting.  Enjoy your day.
Yes, it is! Enjoy your day as well!
Hi, do you use the bible?
I read it but am not an expert.  I know that the tower of Babel is an actual thing in Iraq and the tower is an actually thing in Syria.  So I am not very informed but I am no expert.
I'm surprised it's actually that old. I wonder if the connections to the real world are there. Did you know that apple was first available when the Bible was translated into Latin in the 4th century and that it became known as the Apple when the bible was translatedinto Latin?
Yeah, I did know that, I think it was based on the word "malus" which means either apple or evil.
Yes, Eve was literally eating evil.  It is not uncommon for American students to have read from the Bible as part of their elementary education and it is required to be required for all US students.
No I didn't know that.  Imho it seems like that is not necessary these days.  Do you like Tom Brady?
I do like him, do you?
I know that his book is about the new england patriots, entitled "The Athlete's Bible," it has spiritual overtones and is a book with a different name for the New England patriots.
I guess he is special and does something special. I think that all athletes should follow his example and do things the right way.
Yeah, the fans see Brady as a messiah figure, spiritual for the most part. It's crazy that he called himself a messie figure. All that wackiness and what not.
I guess people are just in awe of him, or at least awe of the QB.
Yeah, in Bill we Trust.  Were you referring to coach Belichick?  He's the one.
I guess he is trying to make an ersatz religion.  He wants to find a holy trinity.
Yeah, football is a different thing.  When I was in college I would be proud to have my alma mater beat poor Cumberland 222-0.  That's right!  My alma matter beat poor cumberland 222 -0.
I guess the coach wanted to make a point, put them on the schedule that way.
I think it was because he hated them so much. He was also against Iowa having pink locker rooms for visitors to their off-field games they play.
I think that's a way to get in there and I am hoping that other teams anticipate that.  I wonder what the impact will be.
Maybe they vandalize the one that played there, I wonder if it mattered when he played there?
lol  I didn't know that.  I guess it is interesting to know that in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that time.  That is interesting.  bowling was not born until the 1940's. lol
Yeah that is noteworthy!  Also noteworthy is that the NFL has no written rules against women playing.  I wonder why?  There are no written rule against women Playing?
I wonder why that matters? I don't know if women can ever play. I enjoyed chatting with you! Have a good day!
You too! You too!
Hello, do you like football?
I do, it is a great game, the world loves the football
I mean the NFL.. meaning the soccer game, not the NFL.
I was meaning the soccer, not American.  The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  Football is much better.  I think the average NFL games has only 11 minutes.
That's not a lot of time.  I don't know if I would have known that the US soccer teams would paint Iowas University's visiting teams locker room pink.
I would not. That seems silly, and silly to me. I would think that if they want to play against my team they would want to work on their minds before they play.
No, it's not working at all, it is a joke, I can see how that could not be working well.
I think so too.  Pink is cute but useless.
I agree. But I think it is good that ESPN won an award for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line, I agree.
I wonder why they chose yellow. I mean, if they chose pink they might not have won.
I think so.  The top bowlers made good money in the 1960's.  Top bowlers Made good money!
I would rather bowl than play football.  Fewer concussions.
I think it's better for the body in the long run too
I think cheerleaders should have no problem sharing a restaurant with other cheerleaders for some beer and pizza.
I guess they need that togetherness for a change.  Both the players and cheerleaders need to get along.  That's the only change, the togetherness.
I think the players and cheerleaders are pros and shouldn't have to worry about it.
I wonder if those tracking chips they use on inflated football and the tracking chips in the tracking in the inflated football would have made a difference.
I don't know, chips is chips is parts is parts, I guess it would make a difference.
That inflatable football would be an ordeal the second time around.  I would not want to go through that ordeal again.
Football is a holy relic, sacrosanct, it cannot be tampered with, it is too sacred. It should not be tamper with, the holy relic
I agree. Well, it was a great chat!  I must go.  Have a great day!
Stay inflated and chipper, my friend!
LOL, same here, have a good one.
Are you a Tom Brady fan?
I'm not, but I respect his skills in football. I heard that he made football his religion.
Yeah I heard about it, I can respect his game so I understand, I wonder if he is credited with that type of method or if he just credited himself.
I guess part of me would like to see him stay involved in football after he retires from the sport until he finds his purpose in another sport, maybe football, maybe not.
I hear his shoe is still good, so he could keep going.  It will be Tom vs. Time.  I hear it's "Tom vs. time".  Do you use Facebook at all?
I wonder if there is a documentary about it, I think QBs will watch it, there's so many rituals in preparing for the season, maybe tips and a few documentary's.
That is great, that is a radical commitment, I will read his book, its a radical Commitment
People are even calling him the "breacher of football"  calling him a cultlike or something like that.
Yeah you have to be careful with that. I like to watch football but I don't watch much football. Did you know Iowa painted it's visiting locker room pink?
I think it helps the psyche of the teams.  They have to work together to get the best out of each other.
Hey, in 1960 top bowlers made twice as much as top NFL players. I wonder why?
I didn't know that.  I wonder how the NFL has gotten so big for such a short time.  It's been around since the 1940s. I feel like the popularity of television has made other sports more popular in recent decades but the NFL is one of the most big.  Do you know why?
I guess so, I don't know.  Do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was?  What was the highest score in it?
No, I don't, 220-0? That's rough, the math works based on how the plays they made, but I wonder how the score would look if you were to do the math on how that math works.
I wonder if they were played by georgia tech and cumberland or if they are 220-7 lol, I think I would have liked georgias tech
I can only imagine that kind of score in a college game.  It's much better than the NFL where you can imagine that's what happens!
Man, imagine the bus ride home!  Hey, can you believe ESPN won an Emmy award for it?
I did not. That was a well-deserved one. Simple and genius with the first down line. Very well- Deserves it.
I agree it made life so much more simple.  There was a player on the New England Patriots who never fumbled the ball in his career.  Never fumbled in his whole career.
I don't recognize his face. Is his name Benjarvus Green-Ellis?
yup, good chatting with you.
Hi, how are you?
Hi, I'm well.  Do you follow the NFL?  The National Football League (NFL)?
I don't know much about the NFL. I heard it is hard to escape when you are in the NFL, it's unavoidable that you have to watch it.
I like watching football and I find it interesting that they divide teams into two conferences, AFC vs NFC, and divide teams by the season.  The regular season only lasts 16 weeks, so you only have to watch it for 10 weeks of it.
I figure that the number of weeks is just long enough to keep fans interested and willing to spend money for the number to get fans interested. It is a sports league. It should be a sports leagues with two conferences.
I think they play more games to try to bring in more money, that's why sports have conferences, to try and bring in the money.
It would bring in more money, but I think the fans gets bored with it. They want the money, not to watch the games. I think players accept the longer schedule for greater pay.
I'm sure they'd be bored. On average an NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay, so they'd probably get bored.
I'm not impressed at all with only 11 minutes of action.  I guess the game is on for three hours and there is lots of commercial advertisements.  Baseball games have only 11 seconds of action too.  Lots of commercial advertisement, too.
Most sports tend to run long.  I hear that fans like to watch their players, but not the method.  Michigan fans like their football.  They want to watch the best athlete.  Tom Brady is from Michigan, and his fans there like to see and watch their player.  Mine like to be called "the greatest athlete ever" by the way.  Do you know what they called him?
No I have never heard of the TB12 method.  Tom Brady is the number one?
I do not know that detail but I do know that he has won a lot of super bowls so I know he is top of the game at age 40. The question is why he has not won a few more.
I guess, he has written an interesting book, he's earned himself a legend forever, he earned it, he must have written aninteresting book.
He puts in hard work and eats avocado ice cream and is the messiah figure for Pats fans. Brady is a good QB. He is a QB who puts inhard work and is a messiah. He puts in work and he is the Messiah figure for Patriots fans. He eats avocadoIce cream for a messianic figure.
I know, right, avocado ice cream is the secret to being a champion and I wonder why no one seems to question the wisdom of it
Yes, he probably does. Back in 1916, the highest score ever occurred when georgia tech beat cumberland 220-0. football has been around a long time.
I guess the Cumberland girls learned a lesson that day. That game is over. They learned the fundamentals of the game.
They did learn. I wonder if they will ever hold up. Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the football in his entire career.
He must have giant hands! The size of steam shovels! Anyway, I enjoyed chatting with you! Thanks for the chatter! I need to go get my giant hands off the football!
You too!  Back to the hit though, do you think that football players should earn more money?  It is so violent and the top bowlers make twice as much as football players.
I loved it, I loved the "violence" of it.  I guess football players should earn money, but bowlers should be rewarded for being thin.  They get paid to get thin and I thought they would care more about getting paid for the challenge.  But staying thin is a thought.  It is violence, so I guess Football players should get more money.
Maybe so. The average engineers make more money lifetime than the average NFL player.
That's great!  Engineers are really well rewarded for their hard work.
Yes, they should.  Did you know the option to submit the hit?
Hello, do you watch football religiously?
Yes, I love football.  The world loves football, it's played everywhere.
Yeah, the world football, or as we referred to it in the US, the sport we call soccer, or I prefer "football" but many prefer "soccer", but it's the best in the world.
I prefer. I like that it is played for the fun of it. It sounds better. Did you know the american women won the first ever us womans world cup in 1930 and the america women have played since.
I feel like there has not been a female player in the NFL yet, but females are technically allowed to play. I wonder how a female would do in the WNfl.
I would be so happy! I would have loved to see it. I would be doing many things with my life if I found a job there. I think women should be able to do so many things.
I think so too. Did you know saint's cheerleaders can not eat in the same facility as the football players and have to eat at another facility? That's messed up.
It is, I wonder why they would let a cheerleader be able to eat in the same facility as the players, and not eat with the players?
A cheerleader is a cheerleader that can eat with the players.
I think they cheer the team up and take part in it, I am not surprised that they are not allowed to eat with them.  They want to cheer theTeam up.
Yeah true, they are the champions and cheer for the team.  Did you know that football players have to have tracking devices to monitor them?  They have to use them on the football players, but not the champions!
I think that is an invasion of privacy.  They probably make sure that the cheerleaders do not eat in the same way as the cheerleader.
I think so.  There are tracking devices that can track things like velocity, rotation, ball speed, rotation (the top and the bottom of the ball) and ball speed when the football players play.  It is quite a bit to use to track things.
I thought it was just a thought! I guess it's a game that is very complex and needs it.
It is surprisingly complex, in fact there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay in all the data.
That seems so short, only 11 minutes, the game is already so short!
I guess they have to make time for advertisements. They have to do everything they can to makeTime
Probably so. They need to rest a lot. The cheerleaders, players, and cheerleaders all have a tiring business to run and run andRun. It's a tired business.
They should be more stimulated like the university of Iowa, who keeps the locker rooms of visiting football teams by painting it pink
I guess thats a good thing, they should paint the field pink and make the uniforms pink and made up a name for themselves.
They might have to reconsider their uniforms and add sunglasses for a bright field.
That could hurt!  But I guess if it helps with the teachings about american football, so be it!  Thanks for the chat!
Thank you too, I'll use the athlete's bible to learn more about the method and use it as my athlete bible to learning
Hi, are you a football fan? Tom Brady recently released a new book about his new method detailing his workouts and diet.
I bet it is a best seller, the guy has so many followers and fans with that method, he has to be the best seller ever.
Yea, the method is pretty popular, but I guess it is all part of his spiritual quest, I guess that is part of it,
I think it is sort of a spiritual quest, but he is fully committed to it. I think he has faith in his faith and is fully dedicated to this spiritual quest.
I would guess Tom Brady considers football to be his religion.
He is a devout worshipper and deity!
Sports as a sport shares some things with religion like community and rituals.
People are thirsty for it.  They crave it. I am too.  Ice cream?  Ice Cream?  What?
Nice. I like avocado ice cream the best, the real thing, not the good ones, the avocado ice CREAM.
I understand.  I don't like to ruin for my children ice cream.  Nothing as wholesome as ice cream, but nothing as wholesOME as icecream.
I know right, apparently that is a major reason why Tom Brady has not been playing for 2 years, that is the major reason.
I guess he has faith in his life that he can do it all. He's probably stuck to that flavor of ice cream his whole life.
Yea, its unfortunate Brady is preaching to the converted, but I think his method is the best method, I think its unfortunate he is the only one
I can see the nature of preachery.  It spreads like all that spreads, but it has not stopped him from having a better waistline after eating lots of ice cream.
Tom Brady makes teammates swear on the Bible.  Did you know that?  Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy used this method when they were sworn in.  Presidents are sworn in using the bible.  I wonder how Teddy Roosevelt did it.  Tom Brady makes teammate swear on a Bible.
I bet they all do.  I wonder how they get sworn in?
I bet Thomas Jefferson would create his own version of the Bible, I don't think he'd use that method, but he would definitely have his own Version of the bible.
I think cutting it out would be sacrilege. He performed so many miracles and the resurrection with it.
What do you think about Tom Brady by the way?
I swear, the creator made the right man for the man!
lol. Nice talking to you!
Hey friend! How are you?
Hey there, do you watch the NFL?
I love the NFL! How about you?
Me too. Did you know women can play in the NFL too?
I knew that, I didn't know a woman has tried out though, what woman would want to do that?
I hope so! The game only lasts 11 minutes and 17 seconds!
Do you like religion or the NFL?
I guess it is. More people watch than TV.  I wonder how many teams they have. There are 32 teams now.
I know there are 32 teams but do not know their favorite ones.
The Patriots, I like the player who has never fumbled the ball in his career, he is the only player to have done so in his whole career.
Yea that is interesting, Benjarvus Green Ellis, good feat, mine is with the patriots so that is a good feat as well
Nice,  what is the highest score you have?
I do not know what the highest score ever was, what was it?
222-0 when Georgia Tech beat the Cumberland.  I wonder who was the first to win by that many.
Oh wow, poor Cumberland, they must have quit when they knelt the ball and let the clock run out, they couldn't win, I wonder what game that was, they should have just quit and let that clock run, they did not want to win.
Yeah I guess, they were good at just playing till the end, did you know that ESPN won an award for something related to football, an Emmy, I don't know if it was for something or something else, but ESPN won something related the the Emmy's, and they were playing tillThe end,
I heard that they won the Emmy for creating the virtual yellow line on the field.
Yeah, I think so. Apparently bowlers made more money than football players back in the 60s, apparently bowlers were more money.
That's crazy.  I bet NFL makes more money now.  By a long shot.  It was nice chatting with you.  Bet NFL makes even more.
Yeah that is true, things sure have changed and so has the way things are going. You too!
Good bye. Good bye.
Bye! Thanks!  I'll see ya!
Hi, how are you?
Hello! Im fine, how are you? Do you like Tom Brady? I love his "method" of getting the love.
I like Tom, he is a great human being, practically a messiah.  I like his method, and I like him as a greathuman.
I don't know, I think he has a way of staying on top of the game, I would love to read his book, I love to reading.
I would too. I'd also like to eat ice cream made with avocados. Did you know there is ice cream Made with avocado?
I agree I think it's great that he's radically committed but I don't know. It would be interesting if it did happen. It's great to see something radically committed, I think.
I don't think I have that kind of commitment. I manage to stay committed to life on the internet, but I can't manage to stays committed to the internet.
ESPN created the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down, I wonder if they have ever created thecreation of a third down?
ESPN has had great innovations. I'm not surprised. I like that line. I wonder who won the right to use it?
I wonder if Georgia tech reached that many POTUS's.  Cumberland didn't want to but gave it to Georgia Tech.
Cumberland folks should have ended the football program. I like croquet better than football, so I would have done the same.
I agree.  I wonder why women dont get in the NFL though?  I know women dont like it
I think the women are smart enough to know about concussions though.
What do you think about the new orleans saints cheerleaders restaurant rule?
Cheerleaders get some of the worst treatment. I think they get paid badly and have to get paid well. There is sexism in the restaurants as well. I wonder what's left over from when they were paid so well and then left out of restaurants.
I hope the players do well, the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an nfl player.  They have to get degrees, and the average career earnings of a engineer isHigher than that for an n fl player.
I know. The NFL has tons of degrees.
lol  The bible is the best selling book ever selling book.  It has over 4 billion copies.
I don't mind having one of them in my mind. I'm glad there are spare copies around somewhere, I'm sure people have time to check it out when they load it up.
I wonder if Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy ever had a copy of the bible, I guess there were two people who had a Bible, Teddy Roosevelt AND John Quincy, I wonder who was the other.
That's a good thing!  I wonder if that's just case they were sworn in before being sworn in?  Well, I enjoyed chatting with you!
I did too.  I'm going to search for Tom Brady now and see what he is up to in the next Tom vs. Time.  Maybe search for tom brady.
Good morning!  Are you a Tom Brady fan?
Hi!  Yes, I am a fan!  I think his style is very much his style.  I like New England too.  They treat Drew Brees like a deity over in New England, I think Tom is a treat Drew is.
I admire Tom. He is a great football player and a great God. But, New England is not a god.
He's overly zealous about his method, and I can see that, but he's a QB. It's not a religion.  Football is not aigion.  The cowboys were created by a dynasty in the Roger Starbauch era, with Tom Landry, and the Belichick-Brady era, but the Belichick/Belichick-Br Brady era has been the best dynasty ever.
I guess many people do want to emulate him, and admire him. I guess it's nice to see a person that is trying to do what they can to help others. It's scary these days how much time we live on by and how little time we get to enjoy. It can be really scary these day.
I've heard it referred to as the "method" and "method of an athlete".  I've never read that before.
I have not.  I'm curious to know if it is truth or fiction, a real bible, or just a fanatical follow of sports.  The Pats won the superbowl and I'm happy to be happy.  But, there are always stories of "Athlete Bible" stories when the Pats won.  Not sure if it's truth or Fiction, but it has to be something to be fanatical about!
I have my FB watch on and fingers on my FB, my friend Gotham Chopra, who is the spiritual journey of the new age guru Deepak Chopra.  He is following Tom Brady's quest to be the next guru.  I wonder how far Tom Brady has come in this spiritual journey.  Did you know he has a Facebook watch with new age Guru Deepak Chakra?
I think people use the word Bible in the context of a sport too often to put religion into a context.  They say biblia-books are a way to put it.  I think there are many ways to put God into the sport and the word bible.
The older generation, the Christian Bible, Jewish Bible, Mormon Bible, LDS Bible, Woman's Bible, and the Bible were excluded from elementary school reading assignments.  Thomas Jefferson would have been a little disappointed to learn that.
Well, people have written so many different stories as history, the Bible has been changed so many times, so it's hard to say if we can find the word of god in all of them.  I can see women writing it, though.  Women have a different take on the Bible.  They find the Word of God in their own stories.
I agree. The apocrypha is so complex, the bible is so much more complex. The world was formed solo in the big bang after a random collision of atoms, the universe was formed from a random random collision and then decided by a higher power that the natural order of the world was right. I think there is a higherPower in the apocryphology, but I'm not sure.
I have not read it but I tend to agree. I think it belonged in the traditional bible which is the New Testament. Luther published the apochrypha as a separate book. I wonder what they belonged in?
Mine are almost identical to that concept.  Tom Brady is quoted saying "If I could compete with someone who has a messianic complex, then I would give my life to Jesus."  I think that's a bit like the concept of "Giving Your life to Jesu".  I wonder if Tom Brady has that complex, or if he has a bit of the "identity crisis" like the other QB, where the "idea of giving your life to God" becomes a bit too much of a "competitor's concept of what it's actually like to "give your life."  Do you think Tom Brady might have a Messiah complex or just a messiansic complex?
Yes I do. He is playing a game throwing a pigskin ball. The concept of religion might include more than just protestantism or even formalized religion. I think it is more than that. He's an athlete who is playing playing a football game throwing an NFL ball.
I think his sales pitch is that he wants folks to buy his books and sponsored athletic gear.  It's a sales pitch to get folks to sell his books.  Do you follow the football much?  collegiate, NFL, or collegiate?
I am not a fan of it. I enjoy following football but I am not much of watching.  I am more involved in what I am watching.
I am not really but I am a 5 year season ticket holder for my alma mater, Louisiana State University (LSU) and I like the tigers better than my almas mater, so I am also a 5th year season Ticket holder
I agree, I think it would be boring in person as well.  I don't know, I could get no sleep sitting in front of a tv-I would be so boring, and the game only has a short time of actual play and it is not as exciting on tv-i think the game would be more exciting in person
Depending on the camera angle and the TV show, I guess it can be hard to grasp the distance.  ESPN won an Emmy for creating the yellow line overlay to show the distance and it helps to show how far it is.  I like that.  They are creating the Yellow Line so you know where to watch it, but it's hard to comprehend.  Did you know ESPN wonAn Emmy for this?
I love the technology that they have created to make these sports available to home viewers, I love it.  It is created to made these sports more interesting to the home viewers.
I wonder if there will ever be a female NFL player?  The NFL's woman players broke a new glass ceiling when they broke through the league's rules during the playoffs in 2001 and the first female NFL ref did the same.  But I don't think there will be any NFL woman players anytime soon, at least not anytime soon.  They don't have the same league rules as the male NFL player.
I think the NFL is the NFL and they are looking for an exceptional athlete who has a strong personality and the locker room is ready.
I agree with your assessment.  I would start off with the lower impact position and see if I could get through that.  The players are not.  Maybe some day we'll see a kicker, punter, or kicker, and I would hope the Saints get rid of their arcane rule forbidding cheerleaders from dining with their players.  It's ridiculous, and they have a rule forbiding cheerleaders to even be in the same restaurant as lower impact players.
Can you imagine if it were feminists that were up in arms about that rule. I know that feminists are against such rule, but I would say it's really unfair.
I bet they would.  That is common knowledge.  I have to head out to my youngest's Mardi Gras parade to get ready to be driving in the floats on a tractor.  Bet he is getting ready for the tractor. I am not going to let him drive in the Mardi gras parade!  Thanks for chatting.  Have a good day!
You too!  Thanks for the chat, have a wonderful Saturday!
You too!  You too!
Do you watch the NFL?
I do, do you have a favorite team or player?
I love the Patriots, my favorite player is Brady, do you?
Nice he is a great player, and his favorite ice cream is avocado, his favorite food and his least favorite ice ice cream are avocado
Haha nice I would love that kind of ice cream! I guess he really does love that, I guess thats why he is an author and I guess that is how he stays healthy too!
Yeah heard he is putting out Time vs. Tom, an athelete bible and a documentary about his time vs. tom, I think its going to be a documentary.
Nice. Did you know women can play in the NFL?
Yeah I guess if they meet the requirements, I hope to see more women on the field in the next few days. I don't know if they will get there though.
Yeah I hope so too! Did you know that ESPN won an emmy for best news?
Yeah they won it for the superimposed yellow line, well deserved!
It has made our game watching easier.  The tracking chips on the players are now used on the field.
I heard that they have stats of velocity and rotation and such, that should be great I think, I hope it can make the game safer,
That would be a great opportunity. The highest score in a college game was 222 to 0. It was a collegegame in 1916, I think.
Yes it was cumberland versus georgia tech 222-0! I wonder if anybody has ever broken that record
Nope I don't think so, that is really mind blowing, what a game that must have been! Bowlers used to make more money than football players in the 60s, mind blowing
Football was probably my favorite sport back then, so I guess it makes sense.  I know engineers make more than football players in their lifetime, but I guess engineers make way more than engineers so I Guess it makes makes sense!
Yeah I guess their careers are so much longer and take more time to earn money but in the long run, they still get more time in the end, so yeah I guess
On another topic, do you know much about the Bible?
I know some stuff. It's crazy it has sold over 7 billion copies.
I wonder what the most influential books were.  Jefferson made his own version of it, with his own title.
Yeah the guy used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts, go figure. It was nice chatting with you!
Same here have a great one
Hi there. Are you a fan of Tom Brady? I am but I wont hold it against you lol, I wont even say I am a fan.
I draw the line at not letting people call him that.  His work ethic, work on his work ethic and being the messiah is pretty much where I draw the Line.
I agree with you.  I'm a Raider's fan and I'm still milking the one loss, a fumble years ago in a game that launched the dynasty and the loss of a Raider.
Speaking of fumbles the Patriots did produce a RB who never fumbled the ball his entire career.
Belichick has a gruff demeanor, but he is very serious about it.
Yes. Apparently, Tom's religion is different from that of Tom's Religion and his friend is Deepak Chopra's son, who is a religion as well.
I think Chopra was in Tom vs Time's show, he is a film maker as well.
Yeah, there are over 750 episodes now, I think I've seen a few on Facebook, I'm sure I've been on there.
He didn't make much money in his career, but that could be the lack of endorsements. I didn't notice he drives an Aston Martin in the commercial but if I notice he's drives an Awl Martin I wonder if that's the product they show in thecommercial. It might make for a better commercial.
yup, I think so too. I wonder if the shows is filmed by Deepak son too?
Yes, he is married, and retires after a few months of not giving up his life for football.  He is only giving up 3 years of leisure to a supermodel he is marrying and getting married in a few years.
Hey, did you know the highest scoring football game ever was a 222 to 0 game? I wonder who won.
Yes that was when Georgia Tech won 222-0
Can you imagine that, I wonder why they didn't get rid home? I hear ESPN won an Emmy, I didn't know that.
Yes they did. Do you know who invented the yellow line?
I love that line it made life so much easier. lol.  It made life much better for Benjarvus Green-Ellis.
I do not. He never fumbled once in his career.
Yeah ironically enough, he played for the Patriots. Did you know that they used tracking chips in the player's padding? I wonder if that's where the tracking chips are for the player padding?
Yeah.  I think they are using the technology in the footballs, too.  Maybe that will help with the mistakes the TV refs make and the mistakes they make with the football.
I don't know. In New Orleans, a cheerleader can't even leave a restaurant if a player comes in.  They have to leave.  That doesn't sound fair.
I know, it doesn't.  Do they socialize or date there?
I agree, but forcing them to get along with each other leaves a bit to be desired.
Yeah I wish it happened here. I wonder why they make that rule. I gotta run, gotta wait till the draft lol. It was nice talking to you, I wonder what happened to them?
Thanks, don't forget to try out the avocado ice cream!
Let's talk about football. The visiting football teams to University of Iowa have a pink painted locker room.
I am surprised that a pink locker room serves a symbolic purposes.  Pink is probably not the best choice.
Yes it does. Did you know that in the 60's bowlers made more money then football stars?
I can't imagine it.  Bowlers are just throwing a ball.  I don't think anything can go wrong with that.  They get paid well, but they should probably get pink rooms to keep the bowlers away from the pink rooms.
I think it's interesting that the highest scoring football game occurred in 1916.
I believe it was in the 3rd quarter. I think it was with 2 left in the first quarter.
Did you know that the yellow line representing the first down won ESPN an emmy?
I wonder why ESPN would want to use the yellow first down line, I don't think I ever saw one like that!
ESPN is a network that lets us all talk about the national football league, ESPN. Did you know there is no written rule against females playing in the National Football League.
ESPN is on there too so I suppose that means women can play football. I wonder how that would effect their yellow line. It would have to be there if women can't play.
I don't know how long it would take, but the average game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
I know, it seems like that is too long a game.  But I don't know how long a games is, they play for like 11 minutes?
Yes, and lifetime engineers can make more money than an NFL player.
That makes sense. Engineers probably live a lot longer than NFL players. They die on the field, so they live a LOT longer than nfl players.
They have chips that are embedded in players shoulders, and record a players moves on the field and on the chips are also embedded in the players shoulders. I wonder how they record a player's moves on a field?
I wonder what the chips are used for.  That sounds painful.  They are in the shoulders?  I wonder what they do?  Is the game without the chips?
I think so. I think it is to track ball speed and velocity, footballs, shoulder pads, things like that. They can track ball's speed and Velocity through the shoulder pads
That is good to know, I wonder if they have chips in the shoulder pads, too, or in footballs.
Yes, they are. I like how students are also required to read from a bible prior to having a talk about it, I wonder if students are not required to reading from the bible prior?
I'm surprised that only 7% of children read the Bible in school in 1963, but I know that is a book of enormous popularity so it is probably why, since it is the most book of HUGE popularity.
I know.  Did you know that the biblical tower of Babel was actually the etemenanki which is in modern day Iraq and known as the biblical Tower of Babel?
Hello there, do you watch football?
Not really, I do like the Eagles.  Do you?
nice that they do. U of Iowa painted their locker room for visitors pink.
Yes, I heard about that.  I think it is a Christian thing.  It's interesting that they seek to emasculate their opponents.  That is very interesting.
Speaking of which, do you like the word Apple?
I think I read that when the Bible was translated from Latin, the word malus came from the word Malus, apple and evil.
Yeah that's really interesting, Jefferson made his own version of the Bible, I wonder if that was the version they used?
I recently learned that he removed the supernatural references from the Bible and that is why he did that. He removed the religious references.
Yeah, it's because of the miracles and resurrection.  Did you know that the bible used to be required read in elementary education?  Did You know it was a required read  in elementary Education?
That is surprising. I am glad that it is not forced on kids any more. It is not my religion but I am sure glad that they are able to get away with it now.
I think there should be a choice. Did you know that the biblical tower of babel was actually based on a real building that exists today? The Tower of Babel.
Huh, so the building is not the actual tower of Babel, but rather a building that looks like the actual Tower of Babel?
It is a building that is believed to be called the etemenanki in modern day Iraq.
Interesting, I wonder if there is any truth in the Bible, or just facts about the bible, or if that is all just another one of them
Yeah, Roosevelt and Quincy both both swore that they swore it on the bible.
Really? I wonder why?
Yeah I agree, it seems like a preference of a religion.  Back to football, back to football and the 11 minutes of active game play, do you like football?
I didn't realize that. I wonder why? It seems like it has been around for ages, but I didn't even realize that it was that old.
Sorry I meant to say 15 minutes, typo.  I'm not glued to the tv for that long to watch a game, it's like 30 minutes, I meant 15 minutes...
Oh, I see, well it makes so much sense then!
Yeah, they have tracking chips in the players so they can track their speed and velocity.  They're pretty advanced.  Can they track their Speed?
Are you familiar with the NFL? Football?
I watch alot of sports. I like American football, but I like football in various forms. I find it interesting there are many forms of football including soccer, rugby, and Gaelic football.
The NFL is the football league which is the american football and soccer.  I like American football and Soccer the best.
I don't really follow the NFL, but I do like soemthing about it.  It's funny that the university of iowas visiting team locker room is painted completely pink.
I heard about it.  That's some kind of mind game.  I wonder who came up with that.
I assume so, that's weird. I also read somewhere that in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players. I assume that means the top Bowlers were doing better than the top Football players.
Bowlers now make pennies compared to the football players. That is amazing.
That is weird, isn't it?  ESPN won an Emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line on the football field, that was interesting.  I didn't even know it was a Emmy, but it was for the Creation of the Yellow Line.
I read an article about that. I can't really imagine a football game without the yellow line.
Yeah. Former patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his NFL career.
That is amazing, I wonder how many other football players have ever fumbled the football
I didn't realize there was one!  Did you know the NFL has no written rule against women playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements?  I didn't know that the NFL had a written rule.
I heard that.  I think it's hard for a woman or average men to meet NFL eligibility requirements.
Interesting. Another fact I didn't know was that the NFL game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay.
That is very short. I wonder why.
I think it's because of ads. It's the best fit for the ads. I've read somewhere that new orleans cheerleaders are forbidden to eat in the same restaurant as NFL players. Could that possibly mean that they can't possibly be the same?
That rule is odd. Why would they be allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the NFL players? Why not have to leave? They are not allowed to leave. Why are they not allowed?
That is strange.  I wonder why they are required to actaually leave if a player comes in the restaurant and is already eating and then is required to actingauallyleave if a other player is already there and eating.
I can't imagine the situation of a New Orleans football team. It would be discrimination. The media should make this rule a big deal so it gets changed, or at least become less of a big Deal.
That's odd!  On a different note did you know that the NFL uses tracking devices in players shoulder pads to record every move on the field?
Technology is everywhere I guess, they want to get an advantage on their technology.  I've got to run now.  Nice chatting with you, I think I'll talk longer.
In place of chatting about another thing, did you know that it is also called the football?
I'm fine! I do know that thing and enjoy it from time to time. Brady has a book out entitled "The Bible for Athletes".
Yes, I did, I wonder if he sold it, or if it was like a bible?
I doubt it, but I think it's because of the spiritual context of the book. Bob Ryan, who was a columnist, said it was cult-like, almost cult- like.
Football is good on most Sundays, I like it when things are going well on Sundays.
I know, right.  I think that's how it works.  Speaking of the college, my alma mater ran out to a score 222-0 on poor Cumberland in 1916.  That was a college.  What a score.
That's a biblical drubbing! I bet the U of M players were very blessed that day. Cumberland players must have been so wrong to deserve that punishment, meted out by the coach with such a terrible vengeance. I bet they were really blessed that's why they were so blessed. They did nothing wrong to receive that punishment.
He had nothing to prove but that is what he did.  Top of the pink visitor locker room at U of Iowa has a pink visitor's locker room just to prove it.
I guess pink is the color of pacifist love. I wonder why that is? Maybe it is because it makes men weak on their knees and unable to cope with what they see on a gridiron. The ultimate weapon of the gridiron is the Color of Pacifist love, I guess pink makes it the ultimate weapon.
I heard that pastel colors are better for jails, too.  Do you think that the NFL has no rules against women playing?  I heard that there are no rulesagainst women playing.
Speaking of pastels, I wonder if women have to wear pastels to identify themselves on the field like the men do.
The NFL only lasts 11 minutes during the actual gameplay.  That is so low for the NFL.
I believe that. I think it is because the players have ample time to get their toughest on a Sunday. They consult the good book for guidance, so if it's not worked out on a given Sunday, they will consult the Good Book for guidance on the next Sunday. 11 minutes? That is not enough.
Yep, I am sure they are praying in the Tower of Babel. It is a real thing located in Iraq.
No, I didn't. I thought they would destroy that thing, the football stadium was built after the war, I wonder if they destroyed that one? Do you know when the football Stadium was built?
Yes, it was modern rubble and I was wondering if that's why it's still there.  I think we're going backwards in our use of the Bible, it's not common for kids to read from the bible in class now, it is more common forKids to read out of the bible
I figure that is because most people didn't have a book to look at.
Agreed. Matt slater, Pat, the actual St player (not the Pat on the field) used to be an evangelical and is an actual St, but he didn't want to be associated with people like Brady for spiritualism.
Brady has a strong faith in the book, he's the mvp, MVP, and an MVP of the mfp in the nfl so the pats have won a few.
I wonder if he believes in the supernatural? Jefferson cut out parts of the bible in the bible that did not allow for miracles.
I wonder how he felt that he could tamper with the word "word" like that.  He positioned himself so he was genuflected to and positioned himself in such a way that he abased himself in a bid to be high high.  I wonder if he felt like he had to bid for the presence of the Lord and genufLECT for a good and blessed day?
Thanks, you too,  excellent!
Hey there, are you a football fan?
I do follow the NFL sometimes.
I follow more NCAA, mostly the playoffs.
Good.  I didn't realize that the season is only 10 weeks away.  There's only 2 weeks left in the season.
That is long!  And there is only 11 minutes of game play each game.
I know, the game stops for a while and it's amusing to think that the actual game time is short, but I wonder when and where the game starts and when the actualgame time isshort.
I agree, the team with the most points is the best in the game, but the other team gets the fewest points in the whole game.
I question that too. Something similar has happened before a few years ago, but not that many.
The rules have changed a bit but the teams havent even score the same amount combined so I think the rules have changes as well.
Specially in the US where sports can be very competitive.  I think they have devices that track a lot of info on the ball.  Maybe that is how the players can know how competitive it is.  They can track a whole lot of information about the ball, and the other sports.
Yes, with technology it is easier, but also the reviews are better and the technology is better too.
You would think so. Do you know much about Tom Brady?
I do, he is a dominant force in football, pretty soon hes gonna run with both fingers to put those rings on his fingers, he will be a dominantforce in football.
You mentioned that football is a game and not a religion.
That's kind of strange, I've never heard of that method, but I know that he eats avocado ice cream. That is kind of odd. Do you know how he eats it?
Avocado ice cream is actually pretty good. In any case football has a spiritual meaning, it has life purpose and also a life purpose for him, in case football does not have a spiritual significance,
Avocado ice cream?  That sounds good, but I think I'm gonna go have a bit of the "Messiah"  sounds good as well.  Patriots fans fuel that a bit...
I think what is good about sports is that it makes people bond together. It is not separate from spirituality, it has so much in common, but it is separate from what we call a "Messiah".
I agree, I wouldnt call many things spiritual, I think it can bond you, I know people have so much in common with each other, but I would not call many of them spiritual, but i would agree that it can bonds people, I like it.
Brady is committed to his method and that's a good thing, he knows how to rebound from adversity and that is a method I would want to use, I think.
Yes, his losses were not that significant, but the 28-3 deficit to win the Super Bowl is a significant one.
He does follow a very strict diet to get good nutrition and stay fit but I think he does not follow too much.
Nutrition can be a mess. You have to dial it in.  I know I have not been the best at it in that area of my life and that is where life has tried to mess me up.  Good chatting with you.  dial it up a dial...
I think Tom Brady is the best QB in my book.  I think he is the only QB that is able to limk all that money that he has and fans are the best fans.
He does? I wonder if he will use that method again soon. That would be creepy.
I wonder if it is a smell gimmick, or a way to get young ones who can eat better with avocado ice cream?  He likes avocado ice Cream!
Gimmick? I know there is a documentary about how much improvement is based on it. There is a book and a documentary on it too.
I have not, I rarely watch tv anymore.  I am a football fan, not a Brady fan.  Are you?
Me either.  What kind of football do you like?  Soccer or Rugby?
I'm originally from England so soccer is my thing.  I've seen rugby.  Watching football can be like watching football but with replays and the replays that have happened for what seems like forever.
Yeah the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay. They need to improve that.
I think it's a cultural thing.  I grew up here and the commercials,  I think I grew out of the commercials.  It's just my opinion but that might be me,  what is your opinion?
Maybe it is old fashioned and old fashioned in a way, like the NFL and the cheerleaders.  Cheerleaders aren't allowed in the same restaurant as a football player, and they aren't even allowed to be in the the same building as a Football player.
I wonder if that is a show or a rule?
yeah, I don't think the sensor they put in the equipment is going to solve the concussion issue. they will just have more equipment and it won't help.
I have my reservations about it as well, but I think playing football is a sport, so there has to be a reason.  I think that players should try to make more money off the fame of the sport, but there are so many players who have no reason to do so.  If I were an engineer, I would be playing football instead of fame.
Yeah, it is a violent sport and I think that can cause injuries and also working conditions.
Yes it is and it is difficult to see that happening in the NFL. I don't understand why there are no rules against women playing, but I can't see it happening in a while.
I think we'll see a female kicker eventually, there is no rule against them.  There is gender equality and I think there will be gender equality.
I don't know, they should write a book and make a documentary about it, it would be good, but I don't think it would live up to it.  Maybe they should make a book  and make it into a documentary.
Maybe. I doubt many people on Facebook watch her. I would make the same mistake. I don't think I would like Tom Brady's documentary, but it might be better than a Tom Brady documentary. I wouldn't let Facebook watch it.
I wonder if a female player will get much coverage. I know there has been lots of news in the last few months about the news of a female players trying out.
I'm sure she would, but not as popular as Tom Brady around Boston.  He is the "messiah" or at least as popular to the popular as tom brady around Boston!
I wonder what it would be like for her to write in the bible? I mean, if you cut the bits out of the Bible with a razor and let people know what you write, how do you write?
I would think he would take a lot of patience from Thomas Jefferson, his bible was on one sided paper, and it took a lotof patience fromThomas Jefferson, a Bible was on two sided paper!
I know, I have too much time on my hands right now, I need to get off here and get some time on myself. Have a good day!
Do you know much about the Bible?
I'm good.  No, not really a religious person.  How about you?
I am too but times sure have changed.  In 1963 elementary education was not uncommon where students were required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education.  Now that hasn't changed.
Wow times have certainly changed quite a bit.
I figure the country is still undergoing change.  Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the bible, cutting out the supernatural parts, like the resurrection and the resurrection of the miracles because he did not believe in the supernatural.  I wonder what his version of it was like?
Oh wow, I didn't know that. Apple came out before the bible was translated into latin.
I didn't know that.  That's an interesting coincidence.  Apple and evil are the same word for a reason.  Malus is the word for both apple and evil.
Interesting!  The tower of Babel was actually based on a real building in modern day Iraq.  The Tower of Babel is a realbuilding in Iraq.
That really makes sense.I wonder why they didn't think to look for that.
It is pretty cool I think, I've never seen it before.
Yes, attitudes are very varied among politicians. Even in the US, presidents teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams did not use a bible in their ceremonies because they did not believe in the constitution and the bible, but rather in the Constitution and the Bible themselves
I heard they swore on the constitution too.
I think they felt that the law of the land is the law and the people should be loyal to it, and I understand their thinking but I do not think they were loyal to the law, only how they felt.
Do you like football?  I really like football.
I do like football, I don't get the chance to watch much, but it is a fun sport, do you like football?
I love watching football. Did you know that the University of Iowa's locker room for the visiting teams is completely painted pink?
I didn't know that. I expect it has some psychological reason for it, or maybe it has an effect on them in some way.
I doubt it. In the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.
Yes, but I guess they watched it more times than some people bowled.
The NFL uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads now.
They are for player safety, and strategy. I enjoyed chatting about it. It was a great way to know more about player safety.
It was good talking to you too!
Do you watch the NFL?
Hello, I do.  How are you?
Nice me too do you have a favorite player or team?
I like the Cowboys.  Do you?
Nice.  I like the patriots.  Brady is a book author, but I don't know if he is a QB.
I didnt, I am finding out more about him, I also didnt know the highest ever scoring game in football was 222-0.
Yeah Gerogia Tech beat Cumberland pretty bad there back in 1916
Yep.  Patriots running back Benjarvus Green Ellis has never fumbled the ball in his NFL career.  He's never fumbles the ball once in his nfl career.
I wonder if women can play in the NFL. That guy must be very good, or maybe women could.
I do not think any woman has ever done it.
I hope not, but I don't know.  I wonder what the point is?  I did hear that they have tracking chips on the players on the field now, hope it is for the tracking chips that the players use on the ball.
no i did not know that, why would they do that?
They are tracking velocity and rotation and other stuff through their shoulder pads.
Wow, I didn't know that lol
I bet.  I know engineers that make more money that players that put in so many hours.
That's a great possibility.
Yeah, I like the topic, the bible.
I know a little.  Did you know that Thomas Jefferson actually created his own version of the Bible?  He was trying to remove the supernatural parts of the bible from the US version.
Yeah and he did it with a razor, he didn't believe in miracles or the resurrection or the Resurrection or anything else
I think history is so fascinating.  Presidents have used a bible for their swearing in and swearing in all throughout the history.
Yeah that was Roosevelt and Quincy.
Hey, are you a fan of tom brady?
I admire his longevity, skills, religion, and football but I have some reservations about his religion.
I don't know anything about creed.  Apparently the fans of the patriots consider him Tom the messiah of football.  "In Bill We trust"  He is the messianic QB of the Patriots.
I understand that true, I don't know who is taking over for him in fanhood.
It is, but if you are being entertained, you are not paid to do so
I agree. I will admit I'm on the edge of my seat for a Super Bowl game.  I'm sure you are.  The Atlanta Falcons were on the verge of going back to win the last Super Bowl and I have to admit, I'm not sure how the Atlanta Falcons came back to won.
I did not see the game. I know he works very hard at age forty to do things he swears by, but I don't think anyone is deserving of his attention for the things he does. avocado ice cream is one of the things, deserving of all the attention he gets for doing it, at age Forty-Five.
Yuck. Hey, I agree Brady works hard but he and his method and best-selling book are basically "The jock way"  I have not had it.  I agree, I am a jock and I agree QB's work method and book areBasically "yuck"
I guess so, but with all the money his wife makes, I wonder what she does.
Do you like football? I've never heard of him, but by all chance a fan of any NFL team? I do like going to games when they are on. Do you go to any games? I don't like football.
Not really anymore, I used to watch it every now and then, I think it is a good game, but not so much anymore.
I like to see it when it's good, and competitive.  I prefer it to be on both sides, so I can get into it.  Who is your favorite team?
It depends, my favorite team is the Packers, but I don't think they will be playing this year.  I don' t watch them much, did you know ESPN won an Emmy award for it?  I can't believe they won!  Do you have a favorite team?
Yes.  ESPN won an Emmy years ago for inventing the superimposed yellow line on the field in televised games.  The Packers were great then.
Yeah Bret was a Benjarvus and also he never fumbled the ball his entire career.
I agree with you.  He was a legend.  Americans are dedicated fans. I remember Favre and his devotion to sports and I agree,  he was a devotion to the sport.
I think we are in danger of losing sports as a societal. We need to focus on the things that matter and not put so much emphasis on the sports. We are in jeopardy of losing them because of the societal focus on sports.
Broo-haa, I think Tom Brady will reach that conclusion some day. He will reach the balance. I think sports fans need to get their football out there for all the sports fans, I just don't think I'd pay anymore for the football.
I hope my friend!  I think he'll be around 10-15 more years, based on the fact that tracking chips are being implemented in every game and the fact That technology is only slowing down and slowing down, I think that's when he'll get it implemented.
Agreed. One thing I miss is the commercial-free games, with only 11 minutes of play and only 5 minutes of commercials.  Watching is better than the 30 minutes of commercial free games I have now.  I like to mute the TV for the commercial only and just watch the game.
No, I don't! I think that's ridiculous. I wonder why New Orleans cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in? I wonder if it's because they have to be first?
That is a wacky rule!  I wonder what logic and emphasis they put on that.  I think that the future of the game passion will be tracking technology and more natural sports talent in the future.  Some folks don't like the fact that they have to do that but it is the way it is.  It takes away from the game's passion and natural sports talents.
Do you enjoy playing or watching any sports?
I do like to watch sports. Do you watch sports?
I recently started getting familiar with football.
It is one of the most interesting sports.
I have a passing familiarity.
The NFL does seem different for women.  I heard that they are allowed if they have met the league's eligibility requirements.  The NFL has no rule against female players.  Do you know what the rule against male players is?
What requirements disqualify them?
True, but I think women can handle some positions with the same amount of acctivity that men can.  An average NFL game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay, which is very short for an average NFLgame.  I think that women could handle some position with the amount of Acctivity they have.
That is quite a short time period. It is a very dangerous activity in such a shortTime frame.
True, but it is safer than it used to be.  Did you know New Orleans Saints cheerleaders have to be required to leave if an NFL player comes into the restaurant.  I think that is wrong.  They should be required  to leave, if they are dining at a restaurant. They should n’t eat there, if an nfl player comes in.
That is a backward rule.
True.  Did you know that the NFL uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record a player’s moves on the field and on the restaurant in the restaurant?  I wonder if they use it on the football field.
I guess they could, but it kind of makes you question what they do with that data. It kind of seems like there's too much data out there.
I guess analysis for strategy.  Maybe they use it to help with injuries?
I hope they can reduce injuries. I don't think they can, there's a high rate of forced retirement due to injuries. The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of a player, but average lifetime lifetime earnings are lower than that for player with a high rates of forced retired due to injured.
That is true, but I think that career longevity is better. I think it would be a better career choice for women, too.
I know right, but they have about 11 minutes of action and there are probably a dozen or so a game.  Thats a lot of dangerous accidents and only 11 minutes and 11 minutes is a lot to get into a lotof dangerous accidents.
I know. A lot of career ending injuries, concussions, terrible stuff. The pay is so high. I would rather be an engineer and have a lot of Career ending injuries.
I agree, I would rather be an engineer too, I think it is a good choice, Brady is an amazing QB with no major injuries, I agree, he is amazing, I wish I was an engineer so I could be like Brady, good choice for me
Brady is a legend. he is astonishing to me. he should retire now. he was a legend, but he was only 30!
I hope he does, I think he's going to be in the Superbowl.  Thanks for the pleasant chat!
Hi, do you like football?
Yes, I do. In fact, football has basically become my religion. It's almost like an athlete's bible. I don't follow Brady, but he's Tom Brady. He has a method that he uses. He says he's using it to help him "become more like Tom Brady." He's the best at that. He's like the new "Athlete Bible".
He needs to get in physical shape, he has like 300 pounds to lose.
No, I am as healthy as Brady. Do you follow football? I am a huge fan of Benjarvus Green-Ellis. He did not fumble once in his entire pro career. Fascinating.
I don't know much about American football.  I do know that the NFL isn't spectacular, but the definition of football is very different than the American way.  There are 16 games in a season, so how does a win count in the win count?  What are the games that are spectacular in the NFL?
Agreed. The highest ever score in a football game was when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0 back in 1916.
I would have had blisters on my hands if I clapped after every touchdown, but roughly 11 minutes, roughly 20 for the first 11 minutes.
That is crazy!  I like the Georgia Tech mindset.  The University of Iowa is so crazy that their lockerroom is all pink!  They have a pink lockerroom for the visiting football team and it made them angry at the Georgia tech mindset.
I know! And the NFL is so progressive, in fact. They have no rules against women playing. I would think they would. It would be ridiculous if a woman ever tried out for the NFL, but it would be doe if the NFL was more progressive.
I'm not sure I think it's progressive because I think a woman could be playing one day, but I'm surprised that there hasn't been a female kicker yet, I think if there is a size difference between the two there is something that holds them back, but who really knows, I would be surprised if there was a female playing one of those soon, but maybe the size difference is what holds them down, or the size of the woman, I don't know.
I am not surprised at all, I respect women and have seen a woman playing in the years that I've seen them train, I think they used some way to train for it. I read that it was a method.
I think female players would be better than the male players, but I wonder how they would get hurt.  There are only 11 minutes of live NFL gameplay on average.
Only 11 minutes? I think the players played for the advertisements, not the 11 minutes of play.  I wonder if there's more to it than that.  How many injuries do they get?  What do they do for the other 11 minutes besides advertisements?
That is crazy. I think it is primarily the commercials.  I think 11 minutes worth of the chips they use to track the movement of players only tracks about 11 minutes of it.  So, it is mostly just primarily the advertisements.
I don't know, I wonder if they track the concussions too, the yellow line they use for the special effect is so good it won an Emmy for the yellow lines, I think it's for the best special effect
True.  The yellow line is very innovative and very useful.  Engineers actually make it.  I can't imagine a game without it. In my lifetime, MLB and NFL players have used it.
It kind of make sense because an engineer's career can be many times longer than football's, so they kind of making more.  If you were an engineer you could go pro for a few times longer, then maybe a multi million contract, but if you were a football player you would be in for a multi millions contract.
Yeah, that is true. It's crazy the regular season is only 11 weeks, that's so fast but it seems like its been on for so much more. And yeah, that was very true.
That's what makes every games special and counts a lot in the 16 game season.
Agreed!  Speaking of in the offseason, did you follow Brady's athlete bible during his swearing in ceremonies?  I figured out that Roosevelt and Adams are the only presidents to use it for their swearing in, though I don't know if it was for Roosevelt and Rodgers or if it's more for Brady.  I follow Brady in the off offseason.
Jefferson used a modified Bible, I wonder what counts as a bible if that counts.
True. I heard that he cut out the supernatural parts of it.  I wonder if that has changed much today with all the supernatural news we see today.  It's become so common in the times that in elementary education, it's required for all kids to read the Bible.  Even at school kids are required to read it. It's been nice chatting with you!
Hello, are you a football fan?
Yep!  I've been all my life.  How bout you?
I do too, I like to play fantasy, I'm a fan of Tom Brady.  Do you play fantasy?
LOL  I am a Steelers fan.  Are you a Steelers fans?
Hah, hah, ha ha. I did enjoy him dismantling my Vikings this year, even winning the super bowl. I think I might have even liked it at one point.
I liked winning the Super Bowl. It wasnt our year though, the steelers actually beat them earlier in the year, so it wasnt their year, but the Steelers actually beat us, so its not like it was our year of winning the super bowl
It just wasnt our season huh? I didnt suddenly go crazy like it did when Le Daeshon came back, we didnt suddenly have it all our own way.
True, the leveon/good o line is a good O line. the backup did pretty well, so no one thing will hurt him.
They have both had short careers.  The average NFL player's liftime earnings are much higher than the average engineer's, which makes Smith-Schuster a better covered target than theaverage NFL player.  He will likely have a higher earnings in the future as an engineer.  If he can get through his short careers, he might be able to become an engineer again.
yeah thats true, but they get to play a game for a living and that is awesome, they get awesome for sure
A lot of hard work, I know! The NFL uses tracking chips in players uniforms and ball.
Yeah that is a cool thing to see, and from a perspective, I think it is a great way to play the game better and have a better perspective. I wonder how many stat they use, but its a great new stat.
I didn't realize there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay. I wonder why it is faster than that?
That sounds like way too much for only eleven minutes. I wonder what's going on in those eleven minutes? Must be suspenseful!
yup, that is why the Super Bowl is an exciting ending for me, even though the last 11 minutes were only 11 minutes because of superior defense, but still, that would have been an exciting and exciting ending
Yeah it wasnt.  The Pats won the last Super Bowl and now are tied with the steeelers for Superbowl wins.  In fact, the Pats are actually tied with those two steeeelers.
Belichick, Brady, and Belichick. It will all come crashing down eventually.
Yeah, he is a good QB and has been for a long time and he has dominated for a while now, he has a run.
They were always expected to win and it was fun to watch.
I know.  I keep hearing about it.  They lost a couple game at the beginning of the season and at the end of the year at the Super Bowl.  But they were sick in the end and only lost a few.
It really is.  I like the vikings and steelers.  Nice chatting with you!
Same here, have a good one!
Have you heard of the " Method" method?
Yes, I have actually, I think the weird thing Tom Brady does is he likes avocado ice cream.
I think part of the "Athletic Bible" method is Brady's best-selling "Nutrition and lifestyle brand."  It's a nutrition and lifestyle company that gives secrets to maximize performance and longevity.  Part of the health, performance and lifespan secrets are taken from "The Athlete's Bible."
Yeah, I think athletes are often on a spiritual quest, just like us.
I would be interested to hear what he has learned from the ultra-competitive NFL in this age. Winning a superbowl at the top of his age, staying at the very top of an ultra- competitive NFL, are two things worth doing?
I am impressed that he's an athlete.  He's in Lebron James' territory.  I think the NFL treats their cheerleaders horribly.  The Saints have a great cheerleaders but the NFL Treats their cheerleader horribly, too.
I agree. Imagine being in a profession that prevents you from eating in the same restaurant as the higher-paid employees and a player shows up, smacks you, and you have to leave. I can't imagine having to be the bus baby, and have to be back at the restaurant when a player show's up.
It does.  I wonder how they would treat a woman player.  Do you think she would get the same rights?
I can't imagine a woman in the NFL. The NFL doesn't prohibit women from being players but they do prohibit them from becoming players.
If they meet the requirements, there are a lot who play on high school teams, so maybe there is a lot of that going around
yeah but I think the average earning potential salary for an engineer is higher, the average earns around $40,000.
lol bowlers used to be made more than football players in the 60s lol bowlers in the 1960s made more then football players,  that's hilarious
The NFL puts tracking chips in the players' equipment to track their every move.  If a woman is in the same place and a man is in another place, the NFL puts a ball in the room for her to mis-step.  I wonder if it has tracking chips on the ball or in thePlayers' equipment.
I don't think tracking anything like stalking is ok, but I think it is creepy that ESPN won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line on the field for the tracking, that seems like stalking.
I think it is, I think it helps get recognition for the insightful commentary, Dan may have a hidden strategy revealed when they score a touchdown.
lol  Did you know that they painted their visitor locker room pink?  I love that they do that.  They painted their visitors locker room!
That's awesome.  That gives that team so much energy for the 11 minutes of game play time that they have!
I think it helps when the games last longer, like in high school games.  Thankfully we are no longer required to read bible passages in school and we are also no longerrequired to read Bible passages in the news.
Yeah, I think children should be required to read them.  But I think a football team is required to Read the Brady bible.  I think Brady is moving in the direction of deifying Brady, not deifying himself.  Do you think Brady will be a QB for the Patriots?
I think they should send both ballers a copy of Jefferson's bible.  Lebron James has one as well.
Nice, lol  Patriot fans consider Brady to be a messiah figure, but the same is not true in Lebron's country.  Some fans consider him a messianic figure. lol
I agree with you, it's hit or miss most of the time.  He does do some excellent things for the community, but his attitude and sometimes salty about leaving the US is sometimes hit or hit.  I think he has done some excellentThings but at the same time, I think his attitude is sometimes salty as well.
People forget that he's so accomplished and that's why so many people forget what he's accomplished.  They can't deny that Brady and Belichick have performed great for the NFL.  And they're both heroes but they were fined once when they were caught cheating in the NFL and got fined for it.
Thank you for chatting with me, have a lovely night!
Enjoy next season! You too!
Do you watch NFL?  I do
I do watch every NFL game. Did you know that Tom Brady is the most watched QB?
I do like him I guess, he is also a book author too
Yes, it is the best selling athlete's bible.  And at age 30, he can still play top games in the best of age.
That is great! I guess we will see if it works for him, and it works well for him. Women can play in the NFL, I guess.
That is ambitious and very ambitious.  I think it is not safe because of men hitting women's bodies.  They have to be made of the right stuff.  At 6'4" and 225 lbs., it is very possible that they could be safe.
I guess it would be interesting to see how the game would go, but I think it would not mix well for the game.
I don't think it would help.  I know they hit women more than hit men so there would be lawsuits and low ratings.  They could hit men and get hits.
Yeah that is true.  Did you know New Orleans has a cheerleader rule?
I don't understand the reason for it but I think they should just refund them all if anything does happen.
That's strange and sexist!  If a player walks in, they have to leave, right?  Why do they have the right to leave?
That is sexist, and it is also sexist that there are women who do not have jobs.
Agreed totally!  Do you know the highest score in football game ever?
Yes 222-0 Georgia Tech vs Cumberland! Have you heard of Cumberland?
I bet you Georgia tech are bragging about that to this day.
Pretty much!  Cumberland's coach last coaching season, was teased for days after.
Yeah, that's a pretty sad day. Off topic but do you like the Bible?
I read the bible a lot. My favorite chapter is Psalm 37. I try to learn certain verses from it so that I can learn certain Scriptures. Do you?
I do! I guess it was part of the cirriculum in elementary education prior to 1963.
A lot of people have had women preaching, and even family members, brothers and sisters preach.
Wow I didn't know that is the case, interesting fact.
Do you watch the NFL?
I love the NFL. Do you?
I do too. Did you know Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink?
I did not know that! I live in a city that doesn't have any pink!
I have no clue on that one to be honest, is there a reason?
I think it's because he was a psychology major, crazy.  He was a coach back in the day and he found pink was calming.  I think he was just a coach and found pink to be calming.
Wow that is cool.  Do you know what the highest score in college football game was?
I heard it was 222-0 back in 1916 and the losing team was so old they just quit.
Yeah that is pretty bad beating. Did you know women can play in the NFL?
Yes, men can play.  Interesting that they can.  I wonder if they can play in the WNBA too?
I am not sure.  I think they could switch it up.  They have tracking chips that can tell the players where the players are at.
That is awesome, I think that they are awesome, they were created by engineers that make lots of money, do you know how much?
I bet they do, I think it will make the game safer, they track velocity and rotation and such to try to track velocity.
That would be nice. Did you know engineers make more money over time than NFL players?  I wonder if engineers make even more money than NFL Players?
I did not know that, I guess that makes sense though, their careers are longer, they have more time to make money so I guess That's why
I bet NFL players are paid well though. I bet NFL player get paid well. Did you know that there are only about 11 actual minutes of gameplay in an NFL game? That's less than an hour of an NFLGame!
That is really short. Lots of downtime after that.
The time is taken up by commercials, and the play clock, but with the action there is no time for the commercials.
Yeah. off topic but do you know much about the bible?
I used to love the bible. I read it sometimes.
Yes, I am not religious, but I do like the facts about it.
Hello,  do you watch the NFL?
I do watch a few games here and there.  How about you?  Do you watch it?
I try to watch as many as I can, but I only watch about the first few weeks.
True, do you have a favorite team?
I like the Patriots, but I know Brady is getting a bit old for me now, I like Brady better than I used to, how about you?
I like the patriots, my team is pittsburgh steelers.  The steelers win or lose, but the patriOTS always seem to win.
Nice!  They are a good one.  Iowa painted their visitor locker room pink.  That's not my favorite but who knows?
I guess they're hoping to really make the other team feel silly and not ready to play? I wonder why that is?
I guess. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
I read that 222-0! Wow, I didn't know that! I do know that Cumberland's coach last season got fired for it though.
I know that game took place in 1916. That seems like so long ago, but the score was so high.
I wonder if the top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars in the 60s.  In the 60's top bowler made twice what the top NFL stars made.
That is insane, things have really changed over my lifetime, engineers make more now than engineers!
NFL players are the lowest paid players my opinion, it's a very rough and physical sport, the lowestpaid players in the NFL.
That is true, but on another topic what do you think about the bible?
I know a little bit, I memorized certain verses of the bible and have read the bible, I have read them all.
I don't read it much but I know some facts about it. I know that it has sold over 500 million copies.
Wow, expectually these days when lot of people are on their cell phone.
That's a great point! Did you know that Jefferson created his own version of the bible, a version different from the one used on the US bible?
Yes and he used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts of it
Yes it is. Did you know he also used a bible to swear on it?
Hey there, how are you doing? The Bible has sold over 4 billion copies in all of time that's crazy! It's the most influential book of all time, the bible has sold more than 4 billion!
Wow! 5 billion? that is a lot of copies! it has been translated into over 100 languages around the world and is also translated into 86 different languages too!
Yup, interesting that different religions have different views on it, like Christians, Jews, Christians, etc.  The bible is used by all religions so it must be interesting.
Yeah and prior to 1963 students were required to read the bible as part of their elementary education, which doesn't even occur in today's schools, students wererequired to read from the Bible as part only of their education.
I don't think school and religion should be separate, I think school should be able to read Jeffersons bible, but not separate.
Did you know thomas jefferson released a bible.  That is a previous president.  I wonder why he did that?
Yup you're right, he cut out the supernatural parts like the resurrection, and the regular book haha. I guess he didn't want to be associated with the supernatural part of the Bible, I guess that's why he used a regular book
Roosevelt and Adams were the only two US presidents that did not use a bible during their swear in ceremonies.
Good question. I would like to know, I wonder if it was something different than the Constitution, did you know that the tower of babel was based on a real building btw?
I didn't know that, but I did know that the US Supreme Court justices have to be sworn in before being sworn in.  I wonder if that was based on a real building, or if it was just based on the law books.
I think the Etemenanki is a building in Iraq, I wonder if it still exists?
I've never heard of it, but if you visit any time, I'd like to visit.  I also would like to watch a live football game some time.  Maybe watch a Live football game.
Haha, I have been to one a long time ago, it was cheaper and easier then. I personally like going to games now. I'm glad ESPN invented the yellow first down to keep it on during games, I'm so glad ESPN did!
Yeah, they won an Emmy for it! I wonder what type of award falls in the category that invention came from though. I don't know.
I think there are many types of Emmy.  My friend is a cheerleader for football games at her college.
No, my friend was a cheerleader. I wonder if the Saints cheerleaders are treated better in the presence of football players. They can dine out and dine in the same restaurant.
I think its backwards. the saints dont let players come and hang out with the cheerleaders because they dont like them? seems backwards.
I wonder what the reason behind the rule is, any theories?
ya I think it's because of all the drama they get with a female NFL player, I think its dumb but I can see a player cheating on her wife haha, so there is always the drama between a player and his wife haha
That's a good theory and a good one. I think it's dumb because of the rules, but it is a physical sport so it's smart because they have to sacrifice their brains and health to do that. I don't think we will ever have a female NFL player, but I think they should at least try to get one because of a good Theory. It's a physical game and they should try to sacrifice themselves for a physicalSport, they should be smart enough to sacrifice the brains and Health to try to do it.
Yup, I think there is a girl that plays in the US now.  Football is quite a physical sport and she is very muscular for a girl.  I wonder if she is muscular like a girl, or if she has the muscular build of the boy in the girl that play.
hey there, do you like football?
Hey there, I love football. In fact, I think I have a few favorite players of all time. My favorite is probably Tom Brady. I love that he's an athlete that uses the bible to stay at the top of his game and I think that's a fact. Check out his method aka, the top method for an athlete to stay on top of the best players. What about you? Do you love football? Do your have a favorite player or player of the time?
I love football too and Brady is one of my favorite players, he is amazing.  Did you know that Brady is still in school and only graduated when he was 25?
That's awesome to hear. Brady started his pro career in the sixth round of the draft in 2000, which is crazy. He's one of the greatest of all time. Rebounding from adversity, and he was the number six pick in the draft, which was when Brady started the whole time. Crazy.
Do you have a favorite NFL team?
My favorite running backs are the Patriots.  Benjarvus Green-Ellis is one of my favorite running back.  In fact, he's so talented that it's almost unheard of that he never fumbled the football in his entire pro career!
I am a fan of the lions, I am a little fan of our team, we haven't won any games here haha, but that's really impressive!
I hate that cheerleaders for the saints are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the football players and they filed a lawsuit against the saints. That is misogynistic and really shocking.
The Saints do have a great culture but it's kinda crappy what happened to the cheerleaders this last year in the playoffs with the referees.  I think cheerleaders have a better culture than the referees, but still kinda crappy.
Agreed. I wonder how the same rules forbidding females from playing would apply to female football players. There are no rules forbying females fromPlaying as long as they meet the eligibility requirements.
Yeah I recently just found out that they have been pretty religious for a while.
I read the bible from time to time and I do read the Bible, I do not know about the female kicker in the NFL. There is only 11 minutes of live NFL gameplay, do you think she would be able to play better than a female kicker
I am not religious but I do read the Bible from time to time.  I know that the game is veryShort, but I think that the games should not be hours long when watching it.  They should be 2 hours long.  Do you read the bible from time on?
I like the Bible. I think it's crazy to think that the Bible has been sold over 8 billion copies and is considered the best selling and most influential book of all time. That is crazy.
Yeah, I know. Iowa Hawkeye painted their visitor locker rooms pink because they have a copy of the Bible.
That must be a nightmare for opposing teams! I wonder if that helped Cumberland when Georgia Tech set the highest score record when they beat them 222-0. That is a record that still is the highest ever score!
Haha, that's true, and it's surprising that the average engineer will make more than the average NFL or MLB player in their life though, so maybe that's why it's so surprising that an average engineer would make more.
Agreed. In the 1960s, engineers made twice as much as top bowlers and twice as many as top football players.
I bet they did, but I think athletes are better at managing their money, at least most of them.
Sadly, I don't think so.  There are different variations of football codes out there!  Crazy, isn't it?  Crazy that there are over 200 variations offootball.
I totally agree, there is so many rules!  Its been great talking with you!
true. It was nice chatting with you too. I'm gonna go check out the copy of Thomas Jefferson's version of the Bible. I don't mind if it's cut out of the bible. I wouldn't mind having my hands on a copy of the Jefferson version of it. I wonder if he cut out the supernatural parts that I don's care about. It's been nice chatting. Take care!
Tom Brady is one of the best players in NFL history, I agree with you there, I think he is one the best ever.
He embodies the patriot, he always seems to win. He has been a prep QB since he was in prep.
I agree. He has changed the patriots and the devoted followers and fans. He sure changed football in the US.
Did you know that the NFL has a 2 hour broadcast, but only 11 minutes of actual action.  I don't think I would watch the rest of the two hour broadcast.  How about you?
Yes, I do. In fact, the games tend to last a lot longer than that. I am convinced that is true because of the gameplay. The games are a lot of fun but I am not convinced it takes that much gameplay.
I think so. I know the NFL tracks them using chips in shoulder pads and footballs for tracking. I wonder how accurate that is. I'm pretty sure the NFL doesn't have chips in shoulders. They just have chips on footballs.
That is great that tech is so integrated into the game and they can make devices to control the brain damage injuries or other cool stats. It is really great to have all the tech integrated in the game.
I think they should, too. The NFL is violent enough to make you wonder if it does something to their health. The average engineer doesn't make as much as an average NFL player, but the average engineer does. Over their lifetime, the average Engineer makes more than the average NFL players.
It is a violent sport, I would love to see a female playing it.  There is no rule against it.
I do watch a little college football.  It is a bit different.  Most recently the Iowa Hawkeyes paint their visitor lockerroom pink.  I like that.
That's funny, painting a locker room pink for the other team?  That must be priceless,  I wonder if it backfires on them,  or if they just tease them and it worked for the team.  I think painting a room pink is a tease,  it backfired on them but still was funny.
I think they stole that from Georgia Tech who destroyed Cumberland 222-0 many years back, they are known for beating anyone.
That is a humiliating defeat, the only worse beating in the history of football! I would do the same thing, if I could have gotten away with it!
Do you have a favorite NFL team? Mine is the Dallas Cowboys, mine is the Super Bowl of my lifetime and hopefully someday they will return to the Super bowl in my lifetime, they are the only team to do so in the NFC.
I like the Patriots but my favorite team is the Cowboys, I saw them last year and I think they are going to do well this year, what about you?
I know that we pretty much spanked the Rams, but I was not thrilled when we did that.  Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have been winning super bowls since 2001, so I am sure Tom Brady will be thrilled about that.
Yes, Brady seems to have a strong determination. I bet he'll be the best of all time.
He has never broken a 4-0 in the Super Bowl, that's a long time, I think he is getting old.
I agree, I think Brady is the exaple because he can make more money off of his deremination, people think htat his commitment is sincere but I don't think so, Brady is just a person that wants to make more and make the most money, I would think that he would want to make the deremination more if he were going to make that much money, but people think that because he is a good QB, he would not have to make as much money as he does, I dont know how to say that about someone that is willing to do that, I believe that is sincere.
He is working on a better method, and you can't argue with results, so in Bill we trust, and he seems to be working on that method.
The In Bill We Trust Method is a key complement to the Rock solid and yeah, it is a rock solid way to do it
Do you watch the NFL?
Hello, I do like the NFL, the National Football League! What about you?
Yeah, it is! Apparently women can play as well.
Yes. Women were actually allowed to play if they met the league eligibility requirements.
I hope they would at this point. I know there is only 11 minutes of active game play in a game.
That sounds light. I bet that's why the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than those of an NFL player. I wonder why?  I know the average of all jobs of an engineering engineer areHigher than that of a NFL player, but I bet it's because of the more stable jobs they can get.
Yeah, I guess it makes sense, football players can have a great career but it is a pretty short career, so yeah, I would think so.
Yes it does. I think it is sexist that New Orleans Saints cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player unless they are already in the restaurant.
That is sexist and it is very strange and rude. I think it is worst if they have to leave mid meal if something happens to them.
I wonder why the NFL uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record a players move on the field, so the league could track how well the cheerleaders avoid being on the Field.
Yeah I think they track velocity and rotation and such. I hope they use the data to make the game safer.
Safety is their top priority. Do you ever read the Bible?
I do, I think it is a very interesting facts.  Do you know any interesting facts about it?
I know that it is not uncommon for american students to be required to read from the bible as part of their education, and that they are required to reading from the Bible as part
Interesting. I'm glad that does not apply anymore. I think religion is a choice.
I think it is too.  Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible, cutting out the supernatural parts of it.  He made a choice to use humanist terms, like "supernatural" parts like the resurrection and miracles because he wanted to keep the humanist version of it in the Bible.  I wonder what he would have made of it if he made a choices in humanist and not humanist Terms.
Yeah, he did, but I don't blame the guy, it was a choice, Roosevelt and Quincy were the ones that swear on the bible, so I can see his choice.
I wonder why? Maybe they felt that it was their duty to serve the nation and their constitution, not to be sworn in with anything they felt didn't go with the constitution.
Good thing we have that option now, it's not as good as the Tower of Babel, but it's still a good thing!
I do not know the tower of Babel but I know the story of it. It is where man was created and the language of the tower.
Yeah and people actually called it the etemenanki in modern day Iraq.
Are you a fan of Tom Brady by chance?  I haven't been in years but he's been doing well for many years.  I'm going to have to check out his "Athlete's Bible" method aka the athlete bible to try and stay on top of the game.
I love Brady and am looking forward to the documentary series Tom vs. Time and the book. I think I will also look into the documentaryseries.
I can't wait for that episode. It's going to be powerful. I love what Brady is doing now. I think he will give up his life for an episode. I'm giving up mine. I don't want to compete. I want to love what I do and not give it all away.
Wow talk about dedication. I wonder if that applies to all potential women in the NFL? Women aren't allowed yet. I think the NFL needs to get on board with that and get more potential women allowed.
I think so, there has been a female kicker, there is only 11 minutes of live NFL gameplay on average each game, so there is not much to do, and there is no way a female could do that, there are only 11 seconds of gameplay on Average each game
Did you hear about the record breaking game between Cumberland and Georgia Tech?
I heard about that.  That is unheard of!  I wonder if Cumberland is still being forced to sit in the pink colored lockerroom that was played by the visiting football team at the University of Iowa, they were forced to be forced tosit in the Pink colored locker room when they played against the University  of Iowa.
Hmm good point.  I don't know, maybe Benjarvus would have needed to go on team.
Yes, he had so much talent and skill that he played his entire pro career without fumbling the ball one time. Amazing!
Yes, that guy is one of the best!  What do you think about ESPN winning an Emmy?
I think it is deserved, they are so innovative and the yellow line they created that represents the first down line when watching a game is so innovative, I think it was well deserved
They sure have made out life easier for them.  They have tracking chips in the players now,  and are placing them in the tracking chips of the players to get more stats.
I don't know. I'm not sure what chips they're placing in those chips. Engineers are brilliant. I am surprised that the average lifetime earnings of the MLB and NFL players is less than the average Lifetime earnings of a football player. Football players make more money.
I wonder if that contributed to the fact that football players have shorter careers than engineers?
Good point, maybe.  But the top bowlers back then made more than engineers.  I think top bowler made twice what top football players back then.
Hmm good point. On a different topic, what do you think about the Bible?
I know a little bit, but I think that it's probably a big reason why it's such an influential book. It's sold over 5 billion copies and is considered the best selling of all time, and it's considered the most influential book of all of time.
That is mind blowing.  I wonder if it is part of the education system or something else?
Honestly I'm not surprised by that. I love to read and these days I can't read as much as I used to. Did you know that Thomas Jefferson created his own version by cutting out the supernatural parts. I would love to have read that version by Cutting out the whole supernatural parts
Yeah, I swear that is what I saw on the news. He said the resurrection and miracles are from the Bible.
I think it is!  Speaking of swearing in ceremonies were Adams and Roosevelt.  I found it very interesting that the presidents that used the bible at the swearing in events were Adamsand Roosevelt. It was great chatting with you today.  Take care!
Hi, do you watch the NFL?
I do watch the NFL.  I like the 16 week regular season games.
I like to watch a few games. Did you know Iowa painted their visitor locker room pink?
I wonder why all the toilets and urinals are pink?  So the opposing teams get amusement out of seeing if their toilets and Urinals are blue or not?  Do you think the opposing Teams get amusement from that?
Yeah that makes sense, I wonder if any teams in the NFL do too, I know they have 32 teams in The NFL.
Yes there are 32 teams in total, 24 in the NFC, and one in the AFC
Yes, 16. Bowlers apparently made more than football players in the 60s.
Television has changed the popularity of professional sports. ESPN's "The line for the first down superimposed on TV was invention won an emmy.
Yeah, pretty cool. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
Yes that was when Georgia Tech played Cumberland back in 1916.
Yeah, it was 222-0.  That score was crazy.
It's hard to forget about losing that game, but even when a team scores that many points, not scoring any points is bad.
Yeah I know right? Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
Yes he is a running back for the Patriots
Yeah, and he never fumbled the ball in his career, never once in his whole career!
That is impressive!  I wonder if the Patriots had that kind of stat over the years he played for them.
Yeah that is pretty impressive. Apparently there is no written rule agains women playing in the NFL. There is no write down.
Interesting, well I'm sure there will be woman who want to join the NFL, but there will always be a fight.  There will always have to be things women have to fight for, but it would be cool if there was one rule that let them join the nfl.
Yeah, I would love to see one play someday. Off topic but do you know much about the bible by the way? I know that it is the only one that says the QB is the one who can play someday
No, I don't know much about it. I do know that it is commonly required reading for many students in an elementary school and it is in the US
I agree and I'm glad it is no longer. Jefferson created his own version of the bible. I'm so glad that he didn't use the version of it we have now.
Do you enjoy sports? I do.
I enjoy some of them, but watching my children play, I try to leave the actual sports events to my friends part.  I try and leave theactual sports events for my friends.  What is your favorite sport?  Do you enjoy watching my kids play?
Football is my favorite and you?
It's my favorite sport, Tom brady is definitely a household name and a dedicated player, he seems to take the field every day and is a very dedicated player.
He is arguably the greatest steal in nfl history
A lot of people would agree with you. I am in awe of his dedication to living a "everyday" life.
wow, that is amazing, did you play in the highschool?
He was drafted as a sixth round draft pick, but he's never had a career involving nutrition or religion. He was a sixthround draft pick.
Probably not, he would not have been picked at all. It is a good thing he was picked, he is the famous Brady of today.
Yes, he's famous for his commitment to his career area and his commitment in his career.  Have you read his book?
No, I haven't, is it like the athlete's bible?
Yes, that is the one I am referring to, it is worth the read some mixed reviews but it is well worth the reads.
I think it's a decent read, I haven't read it yet.  If you have some time, the book will be a decent one.  I'm not sure if that matters for me.
Well, Tom Brady is a guy, so I guess he could use some advice from the guy that is leading the NY Jets, I guess.
Very true.  I would not question him for any advice though.  He knows how to act so no question about that.
That's a good question. I have not read the book. Tom doesn't have the advice for me, but I will read the books.
I guess it would depend on the individual, I am sure.
I agree, personally, I would disregard the rest of them. I am a bit of a homer myself.
People should learn a basis understanding of the bible and their reasons for being stuck in one religion.  I think that there are many reasons for using the bible.
Good point.  I think it's also hard to believe that there are so many things that the average person can benefit from different things, like diet and life choices, that it's hard to be strict about anything.  But there are some tips, tips that can benefit the average people, like how to keep up with diet, diet and Life choices.
In any case, thanks for chatting.
Do you watch the NFL?
I do, do you? Do you have a favorite team or a player?
I love the Patriots, but my favorite player is Brady, what about you?
Nice, I like them both. Brady has written a book and seems to be doing a great job this season.
I hear he has a documentary in production, Tom vs. Time, "The Athlete's Bible."  I wonder if it will be better than the documentary in produce, Tom Vs. Time.
I think so. I am looking forward to seeing it. Did you know women can play in the NFL?
Yeah, I guess if they meet the requirements, that is pretty cool.  I guess it would be pretty awesome if they could, but not really sure if they would be able to.
Yes, and engineers seem to make more than football players in the long run, I wonder why?
I guess that makes sense because football players have shorter careers so that makes makes sense.
Yes it does. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
Yes that was back in 1916 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0
yes, that was quite a game. ESPN once won an Emmy for that game
Yes it was for the superimposed yellow line
Yes it was, it made our lives easier watching the game from home.
It has, I have a question, did you hear about the NFL using tracking chips for the players on the field, did they hear about that?
Yeah and they are tracking velocity and rotation and speed and other fun stuff.
I hope they can use those stats to help make the game safer for the players, and the players. I think that would really make the Game safer for everyone.
I know.  Did you hear of that weird cheerleader rule in New Orleans?
Yes it is sexist and wrong that they can't eat in the same restaurant as the players, or even eat with them
Agreed. I hope they get rid of it soon. Do you know who Benajrvus Green-Ellis is?
I hope so too. Yeah, I do, and he never fumbled a ball in his career and he was always a rb, so yeah.
do you watch the NFL?
Yea, I am a huge fan of the NFL, I don't have any level of religion like Tom Brady, but I do like some of the QBs.  You?
He says he fulfills the needs of his life with football and that is the purpose of it.
Yea, I guess sports has a lot of similarties to things in religion and even rituals such as community gatherings. The saints do that too.
I didn't realize it was such a commitment, I realized each team only rests for about a week, and then they follow a 16 week season, so it is like a team only rested for a few week season.
I guess NFL careers are pretty short. I never knew that engineers on average make more over the lifetime than NFL players though. I wonder why? I know engineers onAverage make more than NFL Players, but I never really knew that!
I know right, I am an engineer and I work for it for many years. The highest score was achieved in a football match in 1918, the highest score ever in a Football match was 222 to 0.
Yea Georgia Tech scored 222 points on Cumberland, it was pretty bad
Yeah that is, that happened over 100 years ago, I wonder what happened to them afterwards
Yea, football sure has changed since then, ESPN even created a superimposed yellow line to represent the first down line in football
Yes, that is correct, they even won an Emmy for that one. I wonder if they have a pink locker room too, I don't think it has a pink room yet, do you?
Yea the university of Iowa painted there visiting opponents locker room pink, I guess they don't want to play with their opponents. I wouldn't mind going to the games there if I had to mind being there though
That is a pretty funny joke!  I wonder if it is trying to intimidate them?  I think that there are many types of football but not many are able to intimidate each other.
I have watched Australian rules football and rugby, what about you?
I like all the football codes, even gaelic football. They call it football.
Interesting. I like to watch the NFL. Did you know that on average there are only 11 minutes of gameplay in the games? I can't believe that, there is only 11 minute of gameplay for all the games I watch.
That is crazy, I don't enjoy when the game stops. I personally think that is such a thing, I would think that time would be way more and I would enjoy it more if the game stopped.
Yea, the NFL collects a lot of stats about the football and the game by embedding tracking chips into shoulder pads.
Interesting! Makes you wonder how they know such details as ball seed rotation and such.
Yea, one day the NFL will have more female players, they have a rule forbidding them from certain positions but I would think there would be more female than male, they don't have to have the rule forbids them
That would be cool! I wonder if they would meet the requierements for them to be able to play if they want to play.
Hello, do you like Tom Brady?
I do. He has been to the Super Bowl 13 times, and he has never been out of the Superbowl.
There is a book out called the "method" but I'm not familiar with it.
I have heard of it, but not much more about it. What is it about?
There is a documentary called Tom vs. Time, a book about creating a healthy lifestyle and a book of credits for him for staying at the top of his game.  He credits himself with staying on top of it.  Are you familiar with his book, Tom vs Time?
Yeah, I have heard of it. Gotham Chopra is working on it, I think?
That's pretty good, I've seen it. Are you a fan of the NFL? I like watching but have changed my view on being a fan because I don't have a facebook watch. Do you like watching it?
I'm not really but I think it's really good. I thought it was weird that Deepak's son was working on a sports documentary and I thought that was weird. I will have to check it out. I follow the Cowboys and think it was really weird that Darya's son is working on that. Do you follow theCowboys at all?
Cowboys? I didn't know that. I did know that the highest scoring game was when Georgia tech beat Cumberland 222-0.
I did not know that. I don't follow college ball too closely.
I used to watch it more, but not anymore I like the smaller regional schools more.  In the 1960s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that era.
I doubt it. There are too many people watching and enough people watching to have the money put in to it.  I wonder if the tech invested in the NFL will have payoffs.  The NFL is using chips in the balls to analyze them.  They put tracking chips in all the balls now.  It is probably worth the money.
Yes, there is big money involved in the sport, high tec, people watching, high TV, high TEC, big money.  Crazy.
I think that Tom Brady has a lot of fans.  They treat football as a religion and have no idea how to treat it.
Speaking of religion, did you know that the Bible is the biggest selling book of all time?  More than 4 billion copies sold, and it's the second biggest selling books of all.
I wonder if that compares with the number of NFL game tickets sold, or the number  of NFL Game tickets sold.
I guess it just crushes the ticket sales so they must have to.
There is some overlap between fans and church goers, so the Patriots have some overlap with the religious.  Matt Slater is not religious, so I don't think he is insignificant to the fans.
Former patriots RB benjarvus green-ellis never fumbled the ball in his career.
I wonder if it's a time or subject where one team dominates and another team dominates because of the time orsubject?
I know right!  It was a pleasure chatting with you!  Have a good day!
Good morning.  Do you like NFL football?
Yes I sure do. I learned Tom Brady has a book entitled "The Athlete's Bible"
I am a Tom Brady fan, are you a Tom brady fan?
I do not really like him. He has an interesting philosophy, but i respect his ability.
I agree. I just can't deny is greatness. There is no player or person I would care more about than a player or people who you can't denying is greatness,
Pat on the pat. Some players have some sort of spiritual side though. Matthew Slater, who used to be a player, is now an evangelist to other players.
Interesting. What was the method of doing that?
It seems to be a cult, Brady's personal philosophy include diet and health. I think other sports have a cult like that. Brady's own personal Philosophy include diet, but I think the cult is more of a cult of someone named Bob Ryan.
I'm not aware of Bob Ryan, but I watch a lot of sports shows so I'm aware of him.  He's reputable.  I watch  a lotof sports shows.  Do you watch a few?
What do you think about the accusation that U of Iowa is using pink locker rooms for the visiting team? I think that is a football thing, not a pink locker room for the visitor to the visitingteam
I heard about that a bit but I don't know the man so I don's know a little bit about him. I do know about the pink locker room.
lol yeah, hard to imagine.  In the 60s pro bowlers made more money that pro football players.  lol  I wonder if pro football has made more?  Pro bowlers make more money?
That's crazy. Boy how the times have changed!
yeah and the yellow line introduced by espn was a development that has won a well-deserved emmy, that line was a well known development.
That is an innovation. I do not see the yellow line anymore. I don't watch football much but I do watch it.
That makes me even lazier than usual, because post-thanksgiving dinner football is the only game I like.  Speaking of lazy, there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in an NFL game.  That's not even more than the 11 minutes in a whole NFL game, which is only 10 minutes of actually gameplay, I'm sure.
that is crazy, it would be like 3 hours! that would move along faster than 2.5 hours
I think it is because of the snap to whistle that is so low.
I agree with you, but that might be the commercials.
There's a lot of standing around waiting be people to do stuff like move the markers, and then a lot to do when the game is actually played.  I hear about the real tower of Babel.  It's located in Iraq, and they still have to do the stuff likeMove the markers.  They have to be located in iraq, I hear.
I agree, and I wonder if it's based on a real building or if its just based on something they saw on TV?
That is cool, I would love to see it. Anyway, thanks for the chat!
Do you watch much football?
I do. I find the sport fascinating. It is an American classic pastime that is enjoyed by spectators and by all but the best of the best.
I have watched it for many years but there are so many ways to get into the game.  So many things to learn new stuff.
Do you know that technically women could play on NFL teams but that the forbids it?  Do you know why?  Because technically women can play on the NFL teams and not the 49ers?
I did not know that, I wonder if we will ever see them playing?
I'm not sure.  Football seems dangerous, but I would have jumped right up and jumped in.  Not sure if they would be smart, but women are more likely to be smart.  I heard that the average engineer actually makes more money over the lifetime than the average NFL player.  An average engineeractually makes more over a lifetime than an average NFL players.
I can't imagine that, especially since it's not a super long career.  I would imagine there are lots of endoresements for the players, and they are bringing in the amounts of money that people would want.  But they have to get used to having the super long, super long lifetime.  They need to have lots ofendoresement to get the amountsof money that they do.
Yeah, I think that's right. There are an awful lot of players that don't go as long as they'd like to.  I wonder if the Patriots are one team that has that sort of thing.  The Patriots have a long history of having Tom Brady on their team.  Have you heard of him?  I think they promote his football lifestyle and religion.  They promote his "team first" sort of Thing.
He's probably trying to scam people.
Yeah that is my opinion too. I think he is just guessing, but I am not sure what his plan for making money is when he will leave the sport.
He could probably get some sort of supplement company or books or something setting himself up in some sort for that.  I think some of his stuff is a little ridiculous.
I agree.  People fall for some of this stuff.  It is weird how some people are so weird that they believe everything and then some people fall for the stuff that really surprises them.  Like Gotham Chopra being involved with this.
I am glad that there are people out there who are skeptical enough to be skeptical.  It seems that so many people who are famous just want to fall for the drivel of the famous and be glad that they did not fall for it.
Yes, he does not thrive under pressure.  I have to admit that the Patriots have had a good record in recent years, but I do not like the Patriots.
I wonder how much money the owner is spending and if they get results enough to make that worthwhile.  Or are they just making the profits to make up for all the money the owners are spending instead of making theprofits.
I would be curious about that.  I also wonder if Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his career when he was in the NFL.  That is very curious considering he is the only player in the history of the NFL, and the only ever player to have never fumbling the ball.
Wow, that is quite a feat.  I didn't hear that.
I'm not a huge football follower for the most part.  I'm wondering if it's because it's so violent and I don't think of it as an American passion.  The sport is so violent that I don'd be wondering if there's another sport that has more violent in it, like soccer or rugby for example.
Yes, I think they classify rugby as being more violent, I have seen football without padding or even wearing soccer cleats.
Yeah, I think the players are probably hiding behind gigantic uniforms, and maybe their bible's are some suggestions their bible. I hope more Americans would take a look at that and start considering Tom Brady's lifestyle.
I hope not too, he is the kind of guy to follow after and be their Bible!
Hi, how are you doing? Are you ready for a fine chat today?
Hi, I am well, thanks. Do you watch the NFL?
I do, the NFL is really good, I've heard it's the national football league, right?
It is good, I like it and qualfy it is a big deal, women can play too so I think it is qualfing now, so that is good
Wow, women can even do it? I did not know that.
I am not sure.  There are only 11 minutes of active game play in a game.
It is a short game.  11 minutes seems like too much.  But with all the commercials and stuff, you would think they would play longer than that.
Yeah, I think so. It is long, and we are glued to the TV for so long. In the 60s bowlers made more money than football players.
Bowlers?  That's great!  I would have wanted to be one of those bowlers!  They were the epitome of cool!
Yeah I guess that's how things are now.  Engineers make more than football players.  How much has changed since then, and how much engineers make now.
Engineers, I think, make the most of their life. They get paid to be engineers. And they get competitions every Sunday. I wonder how much it gets paid.
Ohh, I think I have some ideas.  They made those tracking chips they put on the players that are pretty cool.  Do you know who made those chips theyPut on the player?
Engineers, I am grateful to them for that.  I wonder how they do it.  So the game is safe for the players and the nation?  I read the Bible recently and that is why players should be grateful for that, engineers.  The game is safer.
No, I have not, but I know some facts about it.
I have not either, I have read the Bible and some football but I have not found the answers to all my questions like I found the questions about the Bible.
Yeah me either, I like the version that Jefferson created though,
Jefferson created a bible because he was rich! How would you make that much money? You don't need money.
Yeah he created a version of it that had supernatural stuff in it, so he created the supernatural stuff
I guess it would be a short book so there is only 1 left. Jefferson must have been angry at God for that. He must have gotten so angry at Jefferson that he left it.
He did not believe in miracles or the resurrection of the Bible, he did not like miracles.
He helped create America, that's astounding.  I think the Bible is a miracle that deserves to be seen as such and helped create america!
Good point, he was one of the main guys of his time so he is one of them.
Do you follow football at all?
I do. I follow Tom Brady. Do you?
I do follow him a little but not too closely. He is such a dominant force in football, I think.
He is a dominant force, but I think he has a deep individual side as well. I think his spiritual side helps to tune in to his spiritual, not dominant force.
Cool! I heard that there is a documentary about him coming out, Tom vs Time, I think its going to be a documentary.
I heard about that.  It is supposed to document him as a first round draft pick. I am excited to see it.
I didnt know he had 6 rings, he was a backup QB in high school and they refused to start him because he didnt think he had the chance to play, he got the chance in high SCHOOL and became the backup because he refused to play
Yes, Coach Belichick helped Brady and company a lot.  I think that they all share a common goal which is to bring people together, and that is what is most important.  Coach Belichick helps Brady and Company a lot in this.
Yes he does.  His motto is "In Bill we trust".
I hear about Belichick and Brady, but they just don't mesh. Brady is larger than life to fans, but you can never really hear about him.
I haven't heard much about him, either.  I've heard some of his fans describe his fashion sense as raggamuffin.
I heard it hard to view him as charismatic, but he is charismatic.
Brady on the other hand has his qualities, he and Brady are a good pair, they are a really good pair.
They have a special bond, I know that.  Especially when they had to comeback from behind 28-3.  How do you comeback from being 28-0?
I think partly that is partly why he used a different method. I think it is better to buy something than not buy anything at all.
I know right, Bob Ryan in the book is creepy, he says that Brady is a spiritual figure and a spiritualfigure, I think Brady is, I don't know if the book was creepy or not, but I do think Bob Ryan was creepy,
I havent read his book so I personally dont know if he is a spiritual figure or not, he is just a good football player and I haventread his book either,
I think he works well on his spiritual side but I think we are a little out of tune on how he works.
True, he can go on his path and his path may or may not differ from mine but that doesn't make it wrong. his path might differ fromMine doesnt make it right.
I think it's great that it can happen but it is best to be committed to something that will help you happen.
Very true. Well its been great chatting, thank you very much.
Hey how are you doing, do you watch football?
Not really, in fact I've been wanting to follow the "Athlete's Bible" method aka the athlete's bible to try and stay on the top of the game.
I do watch football quite a bit but I don't practice any sport.  But I guess I do know a bit about it.  Does the method focus in physical activities?
I do not, it doesn't work, but I do know that it has appeared to be Tom Brady's best seller. He has never been below the super bowl since 2007.
Good luck with that!  I am more of a fan of the football teams myself.  Are you a fan?
I honestly love the NFL in general. I think the regular season can be short though, since it's only about 11 weeks long from September to December.
I support it! I was wondering why they are only 17 weeks long, I have no idea but I like it. Do you know how many teams?
I honestly don't know but starting in 2020, I think we'll have division winners from the two conferences moving into the playoffs leading up to the Super Bowl.  Maybe we'll also have wild card teams that are division winners and they'll be in the playoffs Leading up to that.
The NFL has no written rules against female players. There must be some sort of eligibility requirements. There are no writtenrules against female player.
No, I did not know that, but there is a female kicker in the NFL, there are only 11 minutes of live NFL gameplay on average per game.
I am wondering if there are movements in our society, and if they will fight for female players, if there will be female players in oursociety.
To be honest, I don't know.  The average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players is more money than that of engineers.  I don' t see any of them entering the engineering field since engineers make more money.
Absolutely! I am surprised about comparison of engineers and players, but I know players make a lot of money.
Honestly it isn't surprising at all. I found it quite sad though. I also found it very surprising that in the 60s top bowlers even made more than top football players!
That's true.  Did you know the highest score in a football game was 222-0?
That is insane! I would be angry if I were them. I wonder if anyone was angry at the university of Iowa because their visiting football team locker room was painted pink.
I honestly don't think so, I think it's a good joke, but a painted pink room is a respectful strategy, I don't know how smart or how smart it is, but it's definitely a good, respectful strategy
I think it sounds like a bad idea, in my opinion, and forbidding cheerleaders from dining in the same restaurant as the football players of the Saints, sounds just plain wrong and misogynistic, in the opinion of me.
I'm surprised that the rule is even legal but I'm not surprised. I know there are a lot of points of view but I think it is tradition and a tradition that should be kept as a rule.
You mentioned the athlete's bible earlier. I'm familiar with it but not too familiar with the regular Bible. I guess I should know that it is influential since it has sold over 500 million copies and was surprisingly the best-selling book of 2014, and there were no lawsuits. I would guess that it's a best- selling book.
I honestly never read it as a child, but I know that it is now common for students to read bible as a part of elementary education.
I honestly didn't know that either! I found it very interesting. I also found out recently Jefferson created his own version of the Bible by cutting out the supernatural parts. I think it's so interesting that he did that. Well it was great chatting with you today! Take care!
Good morning! How are you doing?
Good morning! How are you?
Hello, I am! I am well thank you, I was just reading about what I heard about Tom Brady's new athlete Bible, what do you think about that?
I have heard of it but haven't read it. What is it?
I have not. I know some people spend more time with football. Patriot fans think that Brady is the messiah. I think Brady is a patriot too. He is not.
Absolutely. Thursday night saturdays, football on all day Sundays ughhh, and all day sundays ughh, I do the same.
Yes it does, I know.  People do not like it when the univesity of Iowa's locker room for the opposing team is painted pink.
lol I didn't know that, I wonder if any female on the team would like to try it lol, there thres no rule against a female in the NFL, thresNo rule against it
Women can be lucritive but they can't play a game and I don't think they would be as lucritIVE as they are now.  In the 60s top bowlers made more than the football players.  Amazing how times change and how things can be different for women.
It is amazing.  The average nfl game only has 11 minutes worth of gameplay.  That is nothing at all!
It should be longer than 11 minutes, but a football player is much longer.  An engineer makes more in a lifetime than a football one.  I am worrry about the concussion.  A football player can get more than one in a career.
I did know that lol thats mind boggling lol
A Saints cheerleader might be really unhappy if she had to go through all those crazy rules, there are some crazy rules.
What is the restaurant rule, that is crazy!
ya that would nbe annoying, and they use chips in shoulder pads to track the players movement, I guess that track the player's movement
I agree, the bible has a supposed sales of over 4 billion copies I hear, and that is just the supposed sales, but I don't know how many billion copies they actually have
Wow.  I can bleive it.  Speaking of language, the Tower of Babel was based on a real building in Iraq, yet it's still published in so many languages.
I did not know that. I did know that the president has to use the bible when he is sworn in and is sworn to be a president.
I think it's great that a private school, which exposed kids to different ideas about treating the bible as a bible, is trying to get them to respect the way it should be. I don't think it is right that kids have to read the Bible in school, but if they read it in private school it would help to keep the societal slide away from the old ideas about treat it like it's not really a Bible.
Good question.  It was good talking to you.  Have a good one.
You too! Thanks! I think you too!
Good bye! Good bye!
Hi! I was wondering about this. Tom Brady says football is like religion to him and I wonder what religion is that. Do you like Tom Brady?
Yes, I do.  I heard he also wrote a book about how he maintains balance in his life called "method of his life"
I have! I love it! What is the purpose of that? What is it?
He has some credits for that, helping him to stay on top of the game.
I think we need someone who recognizes sports. It seems to bring us together as a polarized nation, and it can bring us as a whole together in a way.
I agree, I think the Tom vs. Time documentary and other movies like that tend to bring people together, but I think this is different.
No, I haven't.  I think I'll have to look it up.  Interesting football fact: The NFL has no rules against women playing.  If they meet the requirements.  Did you know that the NFL has not rules against woman playing?
I did hear about that, I'm not surprised I did not hear that, but I did hear that a woman make it as far as playing at the high school level at the High School level in a few years.
I agree.  There are only 32 teams in the NFL, I wonder how many teams there are.
Did you watch the super bowl this year?  It's held the first sunday inruary.  It was held in the Super Bowl this year.
No, I did not. It was not great. Crazy to think that an engineer's average lifetime earnings are higher than the average lifetime Earnings of a nfl'er, but I think that's because an engineer is better off than an NFL'er.
I am guessing that is because of the era. top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars of that era, but maybe they had a longer career.
If you are eating at a place where an NFL player is already there, and you see Saint cheerleaders, you would think they would leave if you were already there. They would have a time to get their place.
I did not know that. That is a really weird rule.
It is, it really is. It has changed the game though, the NFL has used tech and even tracking chips to track players and footballs.
It has, but I'm not technical enough to know how they do it lol!
Back to Brady's interest in the bible, prior to 1963 schoolchildren often read from the bible as part of their education.
I did not. But the Bible is the highest selling book of all time with over 4 billion copies sold and the second highest selling books are the US Bible, it has been sold over 4.5 billion copies.
I am surprised that only Roosevelt and Adams were the only two presidents who did not use the bible at swearing in, I wonder why?
Nice chatting with you. I have to go now.
Bye! ;) :) :)
Have a good day!  :)
Hi, are you interested in Tom Brady's book "The TB method"?
I never thought about it before. I know he published a book about it, but it was sort of like a diet book or some sort of new method, but I never read it.
I have not. I guess it is some kind of diet book, I wonder if it helps Brady to keep going or if it is to stay youthful. Brady is in his forties now, I guess you could say he needs to stay young and stay youthful, maybe that is the way to do it.
Yes, I've heard that is a big part of his method, but it's not just his love for avocado ice-cream that is also a big parts of his way of doing it.
Tom is into healthy food, and the avocado ice cream brand is not appetizing to me. I can't picture avocado ice ice cream, but I guess that is the only thing that would be appetizing for Tom. I wonder if they have a healthy food brand, though?
I hear you.  I heard they are rich and cream stuff, but I wanted ice-cream, the good stuff.  Frozen avocado is so expensive, I could book it.  In the US in 2015, the demand for avocados increased as a result of a high demand for avocado, I hear.  Did you know that the avocado is the best-selling book of the year?  I think as a consequence, avocado ice cream is getting expensive.  Maybe they should have tried frozen avocado.
I think he could sell them for broccoli ice cream.  I would stop at avocado and then maybe put an NFL logo on it and a picture of Tom Brady with a thumbs up and a photo of a picture with a pictureof Tom Brady.  Then I would put an nfl logo on the broccoli ice Cream.  That would sell for more.
I don't know what a food brand company would do with a multimillion dollar salary, but Tom Brady has a launch of a food company for his multimillion Dollar salary. He can't play football, can he?  There is only eleven minutes of live gameplay in a game and Tom Brady can play all eleven minutes.
The stat about minutes is amazing.  The game is actually 3 hours and the only time in it is 11 minutes, and the other 11 minutes is for adverts, so eleven minutes is nothing.  That is not enough time for a game.
I know, it takes almost the entire Sunday to watch those games, I can't imagine they make lots of money in advertisements, in the 1960's bowlers made more than football players, and football players don't even need an entire sunday to watch the game, I imagine they made more in the 70s.
I bet the bowlers are wondering what happened.  I heard a life time later, the average football player is an engineer.  Not much more than an average footballplayer but I heard it was once more than a lifeTime.
Yeah that is true.  Engineers make more than football players and that's true,  is bowling even broadcasted on sports channels anymore?  Football players don't make as much as engineers!
I do think that is probably right.  The average player has to be pretty well set up to retire after about 4 years, especially when you consider the average length of career for some mega stars (10 or more years) and the average player is only 5 years.  That means they have to retire at about 20.
Yeah, I hear that sometimes football stars or athletes mismanage their money.  Did you hear that females can play too?  Did they play they make comparable salaries to the males?
I doubt it, but I understand what you are saying.  I do not know enough to say for certain.  If they were to play, I doubt they would.  The only rule I can think of I suppose would be the rule that a kicker can't play.  But I don't know if football would allow for that comment.
I would imagine that a kicker would have to meet some sort of physical requirement in order to survive a tackle from the 300+ pound linebackers.  I would think that a linebacker would have had to survive from a tackle by a kicker.  Couldn't imagine that.
I am a pretty big guy myself, so I can't imagine myself standing up for myself like that.  I am more of a Bible guy, I can imagine myself Standing up for the Bible.
Haha, speaking of bible, prior to 1963, students were required to read the bible as part of the curriculum and that still is in effect today.
I don't think so, I think if it's coming out of England, where they are still in school and it's religious studies, then I don't see the harm in everyone being educated on religion.
Yeah, I know that the Bible has lots of good things in it and I've learned that. I imagine teachers may find it difficult to teach them but I think if they have faith in the bible, they can get by.
I think education is about more than just preaching, it's about what is taught.  So if religions are different facts are being told to others they should be told what to believe and what not to believe, then that should be taught in education.
Great, we had students like Jefferson who created his own version of the bible with a razor and cut out the supernatural parts to make it more like a science fiction book, Imagine that, that lead to a lead on a book by another students like Jefferson who created a supernatural version of a science Fiction book, imagine that!
Hey!  Have you heard about Tom Brady and his method?
I have, as a matter of fact. I heard Brady credits it with getting him in great physical shape for his age and being in great shape. It's like the athlete's bible!
That is exactly it, he practiced so much!
Honestly, I love it! I love that the NFL has a regular season schedule that is only 5 weeks long from September to December. I can't believe how it flies by. I don't follow it much in the off-season since the off season is so long from August to December, but I like the regular season Schedule.
Are you an NFL fan? I honestly watch it only once or twice a year, but I honestly don't know if I really like it
I'm not a big fan honestly, but Love it. What about you? I don't think I like the rule that is in place with the Saints that forbids their cheerleaders from dining in the same restaurant as the football players. I think it's ridiculous. It seems misogynistic, but I don'd love to see it in place. I wonder if there will be lawsuits over the rule if the Saints go through with it.
That is an interesting question about penalty, I wonder why that lady decided to stay in the restaurant and why they kept that tradition. Thats an interesting questions about penalty and why the lady decided not to go.
Agreed.  In this day and age, if someone complained, they would probably get signed and let playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements.  Women can be playing as well if they meet that requirement but they have no rules preventing them from playing.  There are no rules prevents women from playing asLong as they can meet the eligibilities requirements. Some teams have already signed them.
Me too. At one stage, there was a huge scandal over a lady being rejected by an NFL player for looking like an NFL Player. It became a huge scandals because of the #MeToo.
True, I think the kicker is the one who should sign up for the kicker.  Did you know there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game.
I wouldn't be surprised.  I think it's annoying that there is a lot of commercial time in there too.  A lot ofcommercials.
I suppose women could help financially by entering the engineering field. Engineers, for example, make more than average lifetime earnings than the average lifetime earning of both MLB and NFL players. That's surprising to me.
Yes, but that's not fair for players who are owners of teams.  They have a lot of money, but it's not always fair for them.  The highest score ever in a football game was 222-0.
That's insane and humiliating!  I think Georgia Tech was mad at the University of Iowa because the visiting football team's lockerroom was pink.  I wonder if Georgia Tech's football team was mad if the lockerroom of the University's Iowa football team is pink?
hahaha  Those poor players have to stay at home for that reason hahahha.  I think I would stay home too if I were them.  To change topic,  last year they lost a game by 222 to 0 and it makes me want to read Bible jokes about that event.  That makes me think of the game last year.
I do not read it but I know it's not much better than knowing the top bowlers made twice as much as top football players back then.  I wonder why it is worse.
I don't read a lot.  As a child I did.  Did you know that the word in Latin, malus means both apple and evil?  So, in the 4th century apple become apple and malus.
Wow, I figured it was always that way, did you know that Adams and Roosevelt were the only presidents to not use a bible for their swearing in ceremonies.
I wonder if there were any reasons behind their different ceremonies.
I honestly don't know, I'm not sure. Speaking of bibles and presidents, King Jefferson actually created his own version by cutting out the supernatural parts. I wonder what that version is called?
Nice to chat with you! Have a good day!
Great chatting with you too and go research the etemenanki!  I think the biblical tower of babel was based on one of them, have a great day as well and research more!
Are you a football fan?
I like it, what about you?
Did you watch much tv in the 90s?
I quit watching because of the kneeling and all that.
Ahhh...I totally disagree!  I dont tend to follow that much.  I just dont have cable so I dont keep up with it.  And I dont know about that kneeling thing.  We dont have TV so I really dont tend.
Did the Patriots win again, hum?
Brady was the best human being at one point in the beginning of his career but not at the beginning and he is not now.
I cut the cable when he was not doing so great, no regrets there.
I don't care.  I have the internet and nextflix.  Watch a game, take care of some friends, play games and chat with them.  It's a total blow out if I have to watch a 222-0 game like I did in 1916.
Yeah, I am cutting the cord myself.  I still have a dish but I am not cutting the cable companies.  They just try to stay in business with the dish.
They might start offering streaming packages. They are lowering prices and will have to start offering streamed packages, so I'm cool with picking up the channels I am already paying for. I am not cool with pick up the NCAA football, though.
I have not watched it in a while but it makes sense to offer a package of channels that you can get for the price of the team you like and the team that you watched.
Florida State.  I have been there for many years.  We are a really strong people here and recently have struggled with some strong people in the NFL who didnt workout well.  There is only 1 QB in the whole NFL who did not workout well in Florida State and he is from there.
Yeah, they have some good players, but they have been down for a sec.
I'm proud that the playoff system for the college sports is starting to get a bit political.  I think it is too much to analyze and the playoff has become a bitPolitical.
Yeah it is getting political, it's tough to watch sports because it is a mess and I don't even watch ESPN anymore. It's too political, so I don's watch it anymore.
That is true.  ESPN won an Emmy for the yellow line used for the first down line.  It is a category that fits so well with athletics.  I dont know how else to break away from it, but that is pretty neat that they won it.  You know, ESPN won a Emmy for that?  For a category of that, I dont think I could think of.
I will have to check out that yellow line!
I think it was digitally added as a marker for the home viewers to see.
Ahh, I thought you meant they created a film or documentary called "The Yellow Line" about that. I meant they've created aFilm or documentary about it.
Ahh...the CGI line? I think you are right, but I think it was an Emmy, for something worthy of a field, not an Emmy for the CGI line.
It would.  I wonder if that would be on my cable bill, when it turns up.
lol I'll have to look into that!  Have a good day!
Do you watch the NFL games?
I do watch them sometimes. Its hard not to watch. I really like Tom Brady.
A lot, he is a great player and a great QB, apparently his favorite ice cream is avocado, I like it a lot, I don't really like avocado but apparently his favorites are avocado and sundaes,
Football has literally become his religion
Yeah, he even wrote a book, he has aport for it, he wrote a
Yes and did a documentary on his rituals in preparing for the season, it is very interesting.
Yeah I saw that, did you know women can also play in the NFL, I wonder if they would want to play in it though?
No, I didn't know that. I wonder if they have any eligibility requirements. Have you ever played?
Yeah I wonder too. I wonder if the highest score in any game ever was the highest ever played. It was 222 to 0. Would be nice to see that.
That was a college game between Cumberland and Georgia tech in 1916, 220-0.
Yeah, that was the game. I bet Georgia Tech still brags about that game.
They should be in the hall of fame, not just on television!
Yeah I guess so. ESPN won an Emmy for that one.
Yes they superimposed it on the line before a game for the first down line
It has made our game watching easier, and it is a well deserved award, I think.  I am sure it is.
Yes, and it does involve the viewers more.  I mean they use chips in the footballs and shoulder pads to track all the stats.
Yeah, I would hope so.  I wonder if the use of those chips to make the game safer is because of the stats or because they want the chips to made the game better?
I wonder if women will join the NFL soon if the gameplay becomes safer?  There is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game.  Do you think women willjoin the NFL?
That is a good point.  Technically they could play if they meet the requirements.
Engineers seem to make more money over their lifetime than the average player though.  I wonder if it's the risk of injury, or the risk to make the more money.  engineers seem to do better than the averages player, but the average players still make more.
I think that is the only option. On another topic, do you know much about the Bible?
I know the version Thomas Jefferson created but he cut out the parts he didn't think were worth keeping, he said they were the only parts he did not think were "worth keeping"
Yeah, he believed in the miracles and the resurrection, but not so much the miracles of the resurrection.
Do you enjoy football?  Do you like football?
I watch it sometimes just to catch the play, but I don't watch too much.
I can't imagine that they are better paid than top bowlers. Top bowlers used to get better paidthan top football players in the 60s.
lol, that is crazy!  They need to work a bit harder on bowling.  lol
I would have to too.  I chose that route.  The highest score ever in football is the most difficult on your body.
222-0 almost impossible to believe that has ever happened, I wonder how that happened
That is crazy!  How does one score that many points in one game?  That is too much points for one game!
I am guessing a combo of a bad team and a good team with a bunch of toddlers.
I can not imagine watching football with no scoring the entire time. Did you know espn won an Emmy for the creation of the yellow line for the first down on the yellow lines.
I did not know that.  I have been to my brother's live games and my mom was surprised when she first saw it.  She didn't like it at all.
Hilarious, I was not aware of that.  He never fumbled the ball in his career.
Yeah, he plays for the Patriots. I wonder if that contributes to his success?
That's probably helped. I never heard that he was a QB before, but I knew that he played in the NFL. That's surprising to me that the NFL on average only has 11 minutes oflive gameplay per game. That is a lot of commercials and a lot to see. I think there should be more than 11 minutes or so of live gameplay pergame. There must be a lot more commercials.
The clock runs out after a play and so the celebrating makes the game a lot longer and then walking off the field after a game and celebrating makesThe game a much better game if the clock runs longer.
I agree.  The NFL has no written rules against female players.  Did you know that?
I heard that. If they do have a female player I hope theyd treat them well, I wonder if they do cheerleaders too.
Are you referring to how the Saints treat their cheerleaders?
Yeah I think so, its crazy to think about, they have to leave if the player walks in while they are eating, they can't leave if they are already eating, that's crazy.
I heard about that, that is pretty disgusting! I heard the same thing. If a cheerleader is eating at a restaurant and a player enters, they have to leave and then have to tell the restaurant, "I'm sorry, this is a cheerleading and we have to go now." That's pretty disgusting.
I would think that some people would have fought for it.  What's so wrong with it?
That is a good question.  I hear there is no reason, but I hear that a team tried to unionize and were fired for no reason.  That was part of the reason, I think, is because of the way they treat their cheerleaders.  They are making minimum wage and if they unionized they could have been fired.
I think that needs to change. Well its been great chatting with you, I need to get off here for the day.  Great chatting with u.
Do you use the bible much?
I'm good!  Yes I know that it's the biggest selling book of all time.  It's sold so many copies that it has sold over 500,000 copies in the US.
I figured that it would be over 1.5 billion!  I wonder how much that person on the planet has to use to get around that.
I agree.  It has sold over 8.5 billion copies.
That is tremendous.  It's not uncommon for American students to read from the bible as part of their elementary education.
I think I did know that. Did you know Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible?
I'm not sure, maybe he wanted to keep the parts like the resurrection and other supernatural, he did not believe in miracles or the supernatural, maybe it was a religion in humanist terms, maybe just wanted to believe in the resurrection.
Interesting. Speaking of presidents, Teddy Roosevelt and John quicny adams, did you know that they were sworn in using a bible?
I wonder how they swore in.  I think they felt that they owed allegiance to the constitution?  The government is for the people and they swore to it.
Interesting.  Do you like the NFL?  I'm not a fan of any of the 32 teams.
I follow the NFL. Who is your favorite team?
I like the Steelers.  lol  I am more of a baseball fan as well.  I can't believe an engineer will make more in their lifetime over the lifetime than an average NFL and MLB player.  Seems like they have average career, but the average NFL/ MLB player has an average careers.
That is a good reason to be an engineer!
I agree, even though the average NFL game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay.  I know it's supposed to be short, but I can't see how the average nfl game only has 11 minutes or so of game time.  It's not like we're supposed to have only 11 Minutes of gametime, is it?
I guess it creates anticipation for the waiting, but it also takes time for the standing around and waiting. The moves must show up. I know players use tracking chips in their shoulder pads to record what they do, so the moves must be right the first time.
lol those tracking chips are used in every game!
I guess I can see that, but I understand the game for strategy, injury prevention, and injury prevention.
That would cross my mind.
New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are not bothered by it though. They can eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player and they can eat there if they want.
I agree, that is an odd rule.  It doesn't make any sense,  I wonder if there will ever be a female playing in the NFL since there is no written rule against one?  I can't see a female play in the nfl since there isn't a written rule yet,  that would be an odd rules.
I did know that.  They do not allow female players to be in the restaurants. They have to leave the restaurants if they come in.  I had fun chatting with you!
Yes, lol. It was a pleasure!
Have a good day.  Thanks!
Thank you, you too!
Hello there, do you watch the NFL?
I follow the league sometimes, not a big fan but I do like it, do you follow the NFL at all?
Nice, I don't know much about it but do you know the teams?
Yeah there are 32 teams in total in the 2 division AFC and NFC and 30 teams inTotal.
Yeah, a 16 game season that is a lot of 24 weeks over the course of 16 weeks,
Yeah 17 weeks is a long time, do you have a favorite team out of the AFC division or American football conference? Mine is the AFC and it has been mine for a longtime, what is your favorite team?
Nice. Do you have a favorite team? I just watch the games. I really like Benjarvus Green-Ellis.
I do know who he is. I think he used to play for the Patriots, right? And yeah he is yeah what do you think about him and his play
yeah that guy has never fumbled the ball in the NFL, never!
He is talented and really talented. My dad was a total fan of his.
Nice. Did you hear about the rule for New Orleans cheerleaders?
No, I didnt hear about that rule, what is it?
It's pretty strange, the players are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players.
I wonder if they have their reasons, it sounds like a terrible and sexist rule, I guess cheerleaders at that level make a lot of moeny, I wouldnt put my name on a team for that, sounds like it wouldnt be the best for them, I think they would have their own reasons, I know that cheerleaders on the team and at thatLevel make a LOT of moey.
Yeah I guess that could be right and wrong. Did you hear they use chips in the players to track the players on the field? Did they really have to track them on the Field?
I didnt, seems a bit invasive, the chips can gather all kinds of info on the players I think, and the chips also help them to know the players every move,
It's not like they are using them in the games, but they are in the pads, and keeping track of velocity and rotation and other things like that.
I think that applies to games as well, the only thing I dont like about them is that there is only a total of 11 minutes of live play in a game, that is a lot which at times is wasted on ads, and the same applies to the total 30 minutes of game play, 40 times is wastes on ads.
Yeah that is true, too much downtime.  On another topic but do you know much about the bible?
The Bible is a collection of sacred texts, I know that.
Yeah, it is interesting and has so many interesting facts tied to it, do you know any interesting facts?
do you like the bible?
I like the bible and recently found out that the Tower of Babel was based on a real building in Iraq, the Tower, not the bible!
The Bible is full of interesting discoveries!  The bible was translated into Latin in the 4th century and the first apple was used when the bible was translation into Latin.
No I did not know about that, I do know though that Thomas Jefferson created his own bible version. I wonder if it had any supernatural parts like the Bible did.
He wanted to understand the morality of Christianity and of religion in humanist terms.  He didn't like miracles and he wanted to Understand the morality and the morality the morality  of Christianity.
That was a good explanation. Roosevelt and Adams did not use a bible at their swearing in ceremonies.
I wonder how they felt about that?  I mean, when sworn in, they were sworn in to a government that the people said they owed allegiance to a Constitution, so it must be something they felt they could do.
That's good.  I always thought they were using a bible.  Did you know that football players kneel after games to pray?
I do like to watch football.  I think it's interesting that the NFL has no rule against female players, do you?
Interesting. What do you think about U of Iowa's pink visiting team locker room?
I'm not sure I meant for it to be pink. I can't imagine it matters. I don't think it has any psychological effect on them. I would not imagine it mattered to them.
I can't believe it had any psychological effect when Cumberland was defeated 222-0 by georgia tech in 1916!
I think those Cumberland guys wondered what was going on.  I wonder if the game was scheduled to take place in the first place.  It seems pointless to me.
I'm surprised Georgia Tech kept actively scoring points.  Like they scored the most points benjarvus green-ellis has ever scored in his career.  He never fumbled once and never fumbling twice.
He must be a legend, that guy must get a special bonus for that feat, what a feat for a guy
Did you know that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay?  It is played over the course of an average NFL Game.
True, the game is actually pretty violent and the action is sparse, but I guess fans love that aspect of the game. It is pretty violent, so I guess they like it.
Yes, and they love the yellow line. ESPN won an Emmy for it.
I did not but I guess that is a nice line. Anyway thanks for the chat, I guess I will go now. Have a good day!
You too!  Thanks!
Bye!  Thanks!
bye!  have a good one
Do you watch American football?
I do.  Do you?
ya I do, I hear Tom Brady has never been to the super bowl and written a book
Tom Brady has been to the SB so many times, 13 times.  I thought he would be out for a few years.  He is still going strong though.
Yeah, Tom vs. time.
I have not but it sounds pretty interesting, I figure if you're a Tom Brady fan you have seen him in all of his life, so it must be interesting. I am not a Tom brady fan, but it does sound like it could be interesting
Yeah, he must have a good head on his shoulders.  Maybe spiritual episodes are on his head.  He must have good head.
He feels the football and sports are considered a type of religion by some people. That's interesting. I never would have thought that.
I don't know.  I know the fans are devoted to them but I don't think they know how much they are devoted.  Do you know who Bill Belichick is?
I have never heard of him or Chopra, the author, have you?
No, I don't know him. Is Deepak Chpora relative?
I do remember reading that somewhere somewhere, but I can't recall which article you mention it in. Changing the subject... did you know that the University of Iowa has a locker room for the visiting team that is pink?  I remember reading about that in an article about football facts.  The locker room is for the University's visiting team, I believe.
I know that there was a running back for the patriots who never fumbled the ball in his career, and he was aRunning back for them that never fumbling the ball!
Benjarvus Green-Ellis.  lol  That is pretty awesome.  Did you know that ESPN won a award for the creation of the superimposed yellow line?  I didn't know ESPN won an award.  I think that was for the created the first superimposed Yellow Line, did you?
LOL... hey I know right! I would not knock the line man it change the way I view the game and made life easier.
Lol, good point.  I had no idea the NFL uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads.  Crazy.
That's like that movie they had in the movie, advanced men playing sports with the computer chips, lol!
I wonder how much games would be cheaper to attend now that the high salaries to pay the players, or if it would just be cheaper for the high salary to pay them.
Yeah, they'll have to find a way to stick it to the cheerleader.  I wonder if they'll leave if a player comes into the restaurant to eat and a cheerleader has to leave?
I did!  That is ridiculous!  In this day and age that is just ridiculous.
I think it is kind of sexist, and I don't understand about fraternization. What do you think?
Did you know that women can play football in the NFL too?  There are no rules against female players, but there are no Rules against femalePlayers.
Maybe they can form a WNBA or something.  Well I got to go,  good night nice chatting with you,  have a good night.
do you like the NFL?
I think the NFL is great! The NFL is awesome, they even have no written rule against female players, they do have no write rule against them
Yeah, I like that fact and hope they play at some point. New Orleans on the other hand has a rule for cheerleaders. Maybe they should get rid of that rule.
Yea, I agree, I think it's ridiculous that cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if players show up, and have to get up and leave a restaurants if players come in
Yeah that is sexist, and it is sexist too, because they only do 5 minutes of game time, I know there is only 11 minutes of Game time.
That's crazy! Did you know that engineers lifetime earnings are higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player and an engineers lifetime earning is actually more than theAverage lifetime earnings for an NFLplayer?
I guess it makes sense because their careers are much longer, so I guess it Makes sense.
True point. They also have tracking chips embedded in the players shoulder pads to record players movements, I wonder why?
Yeah, they are collecting lots of stats about everything from velocity, rotation, etc. I hope they can use it to make the game safer, too, like velocity, velocity, etc!
Nice that the NFL is taking concussions seriously.
On another topic, do you like the Bible?
I know a little from church. Prior to the 1960's, it was not uncommon for students to be required to read from the bible as part of their grade school education, and prior to 1960 it was still required to reading from the Bible as part for the grade school.
Yeah, I'm kind of glad it was never imposed on us.  Religion is a choice, not imposed on anyone.
I agree.  Did you know that Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams were the only two US presidents to not use a bible at their swearing-in ceremonies.  I wonder if Teddy Roosevelt did so for his swearing- in?
I didn't know that. I do know Jefferson created his own version of the bible, a version with his own name on it!
Jefferson sounds like an interesting fellow, he used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts of the bible, I wonder if he saw any supernatural parts in it?
Yeah I wonder if he did, I know that miracles and the resurrection pat are not miracles to him,
I guess so. I find it interesting that malus in latin means "apple and evil." That makes things so confusing in the Bible, makes things even more confusing to me.
Yeah, I wonder if people believe that the tower of Babel actually does exist, I don't think it actually does.
Yea, I guess it is known as etemenanki in modern day Iraq.
Yeah, that is a really historic place, maybe you should visit it if that is the case, its a very historic place
Hi, how are you?
Hi, I'm good. How are you? Are you a football fan?
Yes, I am a die-hard fan, but I am interested in all the trivia about football. What about you?
I hear you!  I am not too into it.
Did you know that the tracking chips the NFL uses during the game come from the trackingchip in their tracking chips?
I heard about them during practice, but not during the game. I'm surprised they don't use them during the practice, though. I wonder why they use them for that?
They put the chips inside the shoulder pads, and the shoulder pad of the player to track the player. They put the Chips in the football measure location, movement, speed, rotation and rotation of the ball and the player, and movement of the chips.
I can understand that.  I think the technology is amazing.  The player must get tired of using it though.
They can also compare performance between players pretty good, Tom Brady is a bestseller so he must use them to compare performance,
I heard he has a copy of "The Copy. Is he healthy now? Do you know?
Yes, it is called the " Athlete's Bible" and it is a method, he does the whole thing with a method. He eats avocado ice cream too.
I didn't know that either, avocado ice cream. I would try that, but only with a spoon or scoops of it, not Doritos.
Maybe!  lol  Speaking of bibles, did you know that only 5 presidents have not been sworn into office without a Bible to be sworn intooffice?
I didn't know that. Why?
They were Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams, they cut out the miracles of Jesus from the Bible.  Thomas Jefferson made his own bible, and cut out all of the miracles.  He only used the miracles  of Jesus and the Christ and only the Bible himself.
Interesting, I did not know that. I know that Roosevelt and Adams were atheists.
I was wondering the same thing.  I think I'll have to catch them both on TV to try and see.  The bible has sold more copies than Tom Brady's book.  Over 5 billion copies!
Well, it has been nice talking with you. Have a nice evening!
Thank you you as well!
Thank you.  I will.
Do you watch the NFL?
Yes, the NFL is the national football league.
Oh yes! Do you have a favorite team or player from it?
I like the teams and the faces that go to the places that the players from the teams go to for football.
yeah, that is true, there are 30 teams just in the US, how many teams do you know?
I think about a dozen, I think they are all really good at football and some of them are professional so they are very good
Yeah, I wonder how many teams they have now?
That makes sense, that number is just divided into two leagues or divisions so it makes sense
I think so!  Do you know what the highest score ever in a game was for the highest scored?
I think the highest score ever was a Tom Brady game, over a hundred points.  Was that a Tom brady game?
I believe it was 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland. I wonder how agme it was.
That was bogus, the team should have just forfeited, that was cruel to humiliate that school, the other team should of forfeited too
I know, right?  I wonder why it stuck.  I know U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink.
I did not know that.  I know it was for breast cancer awareness.  Do you know much about the breast cancerawareness movement?
I hope that is the reason.  I can't believe that bowlers made more money than football players in the 60's.
Bowling is the sport of kings!  It has elegance and charm, so bowlers deserve more money because of the elegance and Charm.
I guess it has changed over the lifetime, engineers make more over the course of a lifetime than football players.
I guess engineers have a great future, they are good with math, I am a bowler, I guess engineers are also good withmath, I would like to be a bowLER
They really do. On another topic do you know much about the Bible?
I've read a bit, I like the beginning and the end, but it's kinda confusing how the plot goes from the beginning to the end.
Yeah, I read it.  It is packed with history but it is not for everyone.  I did not like it.
Hi! Tom Brady was a sixth-round draft pick, hard to believe he won 6 Super Bowls.
I would like to see the Tom vs. time documentary.  It is going to be a Tom vs..Time win.
No, but it sounds interesting.  His off-season preparations play a big role in his success, no doubt.  He takes pride in his craft, and his success means that his off- and off-Season preparations play an important role in that.
I've never read his book, but I've seen his method on TV and on facebook watch him on Facebook.
I have not read it, I was interested in it though, I read it to see if any tips could be given to stay fit and successful.
That's crazy that the highest scoring football game was in 1916 when Georgia tech beat Cumberland 222-0.  Did you know that?
I feel bad for Cumberland. Hard to play well with that score. It would stir up a stir. And it would set social media on fire today. I wonder how that score would go back and forth.
I don't think so.  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.  I wonder why that is?  I mean, in the 1960s top bowl players made more than twice as many times as the top football players.
I don't know if bowlers get much publicity or respect today, but I'm sure they don't. Engineers are often engineers and they can have a lifetime earning career and still become pro football or baseball players beat out all the other major sports, so maybe that's why some of the players beat them out.
That is amazing and they also have longer careers I'm guessing, Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled one time in his career, amazing.
That is an amazing statistic. He must have been in good hands!  An NFL game has only 11 minutes of live game play.  That is a lot of downtime.  An average NFL game only has 11 minutes and 17 seconds of play.
Yes I can imagine, the clock is played at the end of quarters and run safe plays to burn time and the other teams come out at the start of quarters to run safe, play the clock at the other end of thirds and run plays to run the clock.  It's not very fun to watch.  I hate how they kneel at the beginning of a play and watch it go by.
Agreed.  Did you know about the tracking chips the NFL puts in players' shoulder pads and their movements to record their movements?  I wonder how they know they're moving with those tracking chips?
I wonder what all the tracking chips are doing on the footballs?  I know it is all very analytical and they have to keep it on the balls and the football.
I guess they're trying to study injuries, too.  I guess they need to focus on public relations a bit more.  The league needs to study the friction between the players and the cheerleaders and create a better public impression of the sport.  A woman could be the first woman in the league, and the league would have to study that.  Maybe they could study injuries to help with public relations, or perhaps they could focus on Public Relations a bit less.
There is no written rule against female players in the NFL.  I don't know if a woman will ever be in at this point.  There hasn't been a written rule about it.  But, I think the NFL is looking into female players.
Yes, I agree. I think it would be cool if they could give them a chance to try and contribute to the team's ability to score as a kicker.  I would be all for it, but I would think a kicker would be more of their team's able to score, and not their team ability to keep it down.
Yes it would.  The bible is the highest selling book of all time.  It has sold more than 4 billion copies.  That's a lot of books.
That's a lot of books! I wonder how many authors have contributed to it. Thomas Jefferson even created his own version!
Yes, and Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams were the only two presidents to use a bible when they were sworn into office.  Teddy Roosevelt was the only one to do so.  I wonder if John QuincyAdams ever used it when he was sworn into president.
I wonder what they were sworn in with?
I don't know.  Well it was nice chatting with you.  Have a good day!
Brady is a Hall of Famer, great QB and a Hall Of Famer
I do not follow football closely but I guess I would say so.  I know the visiting locker room is pink.  That could not be worse.  Could intimidate a team even worse if the visiting team's locker room was pink!
I agree, I think that is an intersting tactic, they are slow and can't intimidate a team by pink but it is an Intersting Tactics
It's a bad year for entertainment, but ESPN won an emmy for a superimposed yellow line that they painted.  I wonder if that's still around today with the superimposed line still painted on.
I agree,  it doesnt even seem worth an Emmy to me.  How is it worth an emmy?
I find it hilarious that bowlers used to be made to be like football players.
I find that hilarious too.  That seems irrational!  Pro players make so much more money now, so they should have more money than that.
I know Brady is getting avocado ice cream. They pay him $800,000 per avocado. I wonder how much they pay him for avocado ice ice cream?
I hear he eats lots of them. I think that's part of the success on his part. He's a good QB, but his performance is not always about the success.
Maybe it is his spiritual quest. It sounds disgusting but I think it is interesting that he uses it as a religion. It is not football but a spiritual quest, sounds disgusting.
I guess it is some kind of religion, but not really an NFL religion.  It's a religion that would make Brady look like a saint.  Saints or angels?  I wonder.
Jefferson was the first to create his own version of the bible.
Sounds like an interesting book, I may read it, I hear its about the humiliating defeat Cumberland suffered, sounds like an very interesting book to me, do you know what humiliating defeat cumberland suffered?
I am unsure of this. I feel like they are using tracking chips in the footballs and shoulder pads of players. Sounds very invasive.
I agree they are invasive. I think they learn so much about the game by placing the chip on the ball or the football. I agree that it is very invasive.
Interstingly, Teddy Roosevelt and John Q Adams used the same bible at their swearing in ceremonies.  Teddy Roosevelt
I guess they arent religious, they lost a lot of votes for that, they must have lost a whole lot of Votes
It's weird to think that people back then knew that they had to separate country and religion.  Unlike today where they have the Bible in schools, they include passages from the bible in schools.
I think that religion shouldnt be mandatory. it should be respected in all cultures, different views, but religion shouldn't be mandatory to be the same.
I find it ineresting that apple means both fruit and malace.
I know, it has an interesting origin I agree.
Hi, do you watch the NFL?
I love the NFL! What about you?
Me too. Who is your favorite player? Tom Brady is my favorite player.
My favorite player is Brady, he is very talented and he has won so many, his determination to win is very talent, and his determination is very determined, he has always won, so my favorite player
Did you hear about the book author?
Yeah two books, the method and athletes bible. I think he also makes money from endorcements from it.
Yeah talk about talent. He stays healthy by eating avocado ice cream.
I wonder if there is a trick to that?  I know Brady is one of my favorites to win the Superbowl.  I wonder if avocado icecream is going to be one of his favorites to won it in the Super Bowl?
Did you know that women can technically play in the NFL?
I didnt know that, I didnt know they were, I cant imagine they would like it, suprise they dont play for the NFL though
I would be curious to see if there is an option.  I wonder if they have a rule against it.  New Orleans cheerleaders have to do something good to be able to hear it. I wonder why the rule is that way.
I did not. What is the rule about the cheerleaders?
They are allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players.
That is such a bad rule. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the yellow "Creatioin" that they used when ESPN won a Emmy for their yellow first down
I guess it is pretty cool to win an award for that. I think a lot of us would be watching the game from home, so it would be pretty cool.
It is easy to follow, and it helps to make the game more organized, one of the greatest inventions of all, it is easy.
Agreed. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
I do not know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
He is a RB who played for the Patriots. He never fumbled the ball in his career.
That sounds like a hard thing to do, fumbling.  That is great that he did it, but it must be a hard, hard thing.
Yeah, definitely. Nice chatting with you.
Are you a football fan?
I like soccer, but not so much football.  It is so popular in the world.
Are you talking about soccer or American football? The NFL?
Football is also called soccer, but soccer is called soccer.
I don't really know much about soccer. I am interested in odd facts about sports. Are you interested inodd facts about football?  I like college football.  They painted their visiting teams locker pink.
I guess it is for breast cancer awareness?  I guess that is something that is useful for them to do. I wonder how many football players suffer from breast cancer over the years.
I would have thought so. Interesting perspective. Do you like soccer?
I think it is a good game for women. Women fight harder on the pitch than men.
I have a feeling that the woman's will to fight is more.  They do it better than the man.  Do you like soccer as a woman?
Not really. They are not allowed to play if you are not green. I think it is good to be able to set things aright. I like american football better. It is not allowed.
I think there is a big fight in american football because of that, I think the game is too much of a fight in American football.
True.  Men are always trying to find reasons to fight and people accept it as an easy way to get along with men.
I think that they need to fight because it is a way to blow off steam and get away.  Do you like to fight?  I like to blow it off.
I like to blow off stream by fighting through playing a sport. I also like to read the bible.
I do not read the bible, but I do know that it was developed around the concept of the god.
I have. I like that in the Bible, he is able to invent his own enemies, seek righteous vengence on the field of battle for women and use them as enemies, he had to invent this on the battlefield.
I am not familiar with the MMA, can they join the MMA?
Yeah,  I am.  I'm not very good at it but I try.
Wow, I hope it doesn't get on the bad side.
Me too, I hope to meet god some day and challenge him to a cool MMA sport match-up.
Good luck on your quest!
Do you watch the NFL?
I do, I am a big patriots fan, what about you?
Nice!  Did you know Brady is the obok author?  I assume that means he was obok's author?
I do like him. I think his book is inspiring. It's a pretty good book.
I have not read that one, but I am looking forward to it.  Have you seen the series Tom vs. time?
He is really good.  He has been staying healthy the last few years.
He is, he says the reason he sticks to healthy ice cream is because avocado is the best.
I wonder if that's why he has such a good supporting cast.  He has a good running backs.  Benjarvus Green-Ellis has been a staple on the team, and he has never fumbled in his career, and they have a stable back/st stable back and a good back/back/back-up linemen, so he has a pretty good supporting team.
That is impressive that he managed to do that his whole career.  Did you know that women can play in the nfl too?  I wonder how many women have managed to play in his career.
No, there are no written rules against them.
I do not think so but I don't know if women can either.
No I don't either.
Yeah, me too. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
222-0. Georgia tech beat Cumberland in 1916. I think that was in the early 1900s.
I think that's a record, but that's quite a win!  Since we are on the topic of the Bible, what do you know about that record?
I know a little bit.  I know in school, we were required to read from the bible.  It was not uncommon for me to be in school.
Yesh, strange. It's sold over 5 billion copies.
Did you know that the bible was translated into Latin in the 4th century, the apple was the first to have it translated intoLatin.
I did not know that. Did you know the word malus comes from the word Malus, meaning as evil?
Pretty interesting. I heard that Teddy Roosevelt didn't use a bible in his swearing-in ceremony and there was outrage back then. I wonder why?
I'm sure there was.  Quincy, QC did the right thing by doing that.
do you know much about the bible?
I know that it is the best selling book of all time
I see, times have certainly changed since then, it was not uncommon for American students to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education, and that has changed.
My mom told me that!  I wonder if Thomas Jefferson ever did that.  He was into miracles and the resurrection, and the miracles that came about after.
True.  He created his own religion in humanist terms.  It is said that he wanted to have his own version of the Bible, but he created it because he wanted it to be his religion.
Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams were the two that believed in it.
Yes, but at swearing-in ceremonies, they swore to the constitution not the Bible.
Interesting. Do you know how much work Apple does for us?
Apple and evil is an interesting coincidence, Eve actually ate evil, Malus comes from the word for "evil" and Eve actually eat evil, interesting coincidence!
Good point.  Tom Brady seems to be a true believer and very spiritual person.  I like that.  He seems to have a spiritual value.
I guess I should have sworn it in the Bible!  LOL
Haha. Maybe he would write his own Bible like book called "An athlete's Bible."
I guess it is a best seller, I wonder if he is a champion of it, I would want to read it.
No, but I saw there are facebook videos called "Tom vs. Time" and "Days Like These" the other day.
I would like to too, a lot of interesting personalities in the NFL and I think women would be allowed in the nfl, there is no rule against female players, if they meet the league's eligibility requirements and if they met the league't's eligibility Requirements, women would
I never knew that. I also never knew about the fact that cheerleaders cant eat in the same restaurant as the players.
Yeah, that is sexist and also sexist because that means that cheerleaders are required to leave if they're on the field, if the players come in the field.  I wonder if there are any situations where the cheerleaders have to leave.  The NFL uses tracking chips in the shoulder pads and moves to record the movement to avoid players in certain situations.  Did you know that the NFL uses trackers on the shoulder chips to record players movements on the fields and the cheerleader moves to track their movement on the sidelines to record their movement off the field?
That would be cool!  ESPN created the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line, did you know that?
I guess it is not very innovative since it seems so normal and obvious. I enjoyed chatting with you, thanks for your time.
Same here, have you ever read Tom Brady's book?
I will enjoy it as well. Did you know he was in the swearing in ceremony in 1981.
lol I will!  I think I will do that!  Thanks!
Have you read Tom Bradys book, The Method of the Deal?
I have heard that it gives joy and peak performance in every life. Good health, good health, and peak Performance.
For sure lol, and don't forget the avocado ice cream.
No, never had that, sounds too good!  But I enjoy avocados!  I wonder if the book is Brady's best selling athlete bible and lifestyle brand.  The book is brady's best seller.
Yeah, he manages to do it all. He's great. The Patriots can say "bill we trust" but the fans can't because of greed and not being great, but that's how the Patriots are. In Bill we Trust.
I think the game of the game is a devotional love for him, and football is Tom Brady's religion of sorts. He has his own religion of sort.
Yeah I heard about that in a book, he has a cultist undertone to him.
I like that football is a vocation-it gives you life meaning and purpose, but not a vocations.
Yeah, there is so much bigger than football and so much that is bigger than wins and losses.
There will be a series on Facebook Watch where the episodes will focus on the physical and mental preparation for him. It will also focus on his spiritual side as well.
Yeah, it is called Tom vs. Time.
Yes. He wants to learn how to live his spiritual life through sports and to be authentic so he can learn how he can be more authentic in his spiritual Life
Yeah he does sound zen. Did you know U of Iowa universities visiting locker room is painted pink?
That is funny.  ESPN won an Emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line.  I wonder why?
I love that line!  It represents me as a retired Patriot.  I never fumbled the ball in my career and I never lost it.  lol  I wonder if it represents a retired patriot who has never fumbling the ball?
Benjarvis Green-Ellis!
Yes that was him, amazing accomplishment considering how long a regular season is, only 18.5 long aregular season!
Yes that is correct 1630 games
Yes 16 games is correct. If the teams split into two divisions and each has a bi-week it makes it 18 weeks, and the teams have to be in their divisions for 12 weeks.
Did you know NFL uses tracking chips embedded in their shoulder pads to record their moves?
I wonder if they are using the tech in the ball to record speed and velocity of the ball. They are.  Maybe in 10-15 years they will be using it in the game and the ball will have a tech in it that can record speed & velocity of it all.
Interesting. I read that the NFL has no written rule against female players. Did you know that?
Yes, I heard that too.  Were you not aware of that?
I don't think they are allowed to, if they met the eligibility requirements.  I wonder who the other two were?
What do you think about the WNBA? Should they create a league of their own?
Yeah, I think so too. Good for them. The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
That is a lot of commercials. I am watching a lot. Nice talking to you.
Hi, how are you this morning?  Do you like Tom Brady?  He is a health enthusiast and football player and he is also into spirituality and the spirituality of being a health and health enthusiast.
I dont know much about his spirituality, I like the patriots but Brady is ok.
He has a spiritual approach to life, I think.  He believes that the game has a purpose and a purpose but it can unite people in a spiritual way.
He has published two books, "The Athlete's Bible" and "The Method", which is a method that is a great way to look at it, and he published two book, too.
I didn't know that.  Moving on to football, the highest score ever in football was in 1916 in Georgia tech vs Cumberland 222-0.
222-0 what a humiliating defeatWow, was the team blind or something?
Haha-I know!  I know the term football covers any sport that involves kicking a ball.  I'm not sure I could think of a sport that involved kicking a BALL.
Yeah thats soccer,  my favorite sport!
Nice, I like it too. The NFL has no rule against female players so long as they meet eligibility requirements. I like the idea of the NFL having no ruleagainst female players.
I had no idea either, no matter what they look like. I have no Idea what my thoughts are on that, but I think if a woman was in the game it would strength the game and not disadvantage it for sure, what are your thoughts on that?
I think it is, especially since the new orleans saints cheerleaders have to eat in the same restaurant as the player, and if they leave they have to leave before the player.
That seems like an unfair rule, I wonder why, do you watch the football player Benjarvus Green Ellis play?
I did not. Who is he?
He was a running back for the Patriots, he was great, never fumbled a ball and was retired because he never fumbles a ball as a runningBack!
Wow, that is impressive! The NFL uses chips in shoulder pads to help track velocity ball speed, rotation and location. They also use the chips to track velocity of the balls in the air, ball speed , rotation and Location.
I didn't know that.  It's crazy how tech is taking over all of the sports.  I know there is a creation of the first line in football.  That made the game the first sport in the world.
Agreed. I think it goes back to Tom mention.  Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the bible.  Did you know that he used to keep a bible in each of his cars, just like Thomas Jefferson did.
No I didn't know that, Jefferson was a really smart man, I wonder if he used the original version?
He was smart, but I wonder why it differed so much. Maybe the fact he used a razor and removed all of those supernatural references, smart! Good talking today, thanks for the fact and I have to go.
that is odd. miracles and supernatural parts? i guess he had his reasons.
I guess so. Well, it's been nice chatting with you, I think I will say goodbye now. Have a great day!
Hi, Great friend.  Have you thought about football recently?
I'm good, thanks.  I haven't thought about it much since the Superbowl.  How about you?  Do you like basketball?
I do like basketball, I thought it was the only sport that was recognized as a sport in the bible. I thought that was in our blood, but maybe it's just my blood.
In any case, I guess it is.  I like football and hockey.
True, but I figure that basketball would be the only sport that would add helmets and pads and tackling.  I think women's soccer would have to get real with their blood makes up the blood of the sport.
Hmm, I guess Bible times and modern times differ a lot. I guess bible times and Modern times differ. I wonder if that would be acceptable?
I'm sure it would if it was not for the blood criterion. Bowling is also technically a sport, in the 60s bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.
I think there is a wide range of sports knowledge that we can learn from.
A strict religious upbringing and the athletic catechism I got received gave my holy insight into sports. I am one of the holiest, and the holiest of all, so football.
Do you have a religion?
I don't know what faith, but I reckon it's a proper name for it.  Football and sports were part of it before my forebears gave it a proper, though I wonder what it was called before.
Interesting. Are you a fan of a football team?
I am a fan of the team that I strive to have faith in. In the eyes of the creator, a transgression of the faith is not a transgressive but rather a transference that is recognized by the Creator and is saved, favoring one team over another. There is not much hierarchy in the Church, just a hierarchy of what is recognized and what is not recognized.
I wonder which form of church or what religion you speak of.
No formal church, but members of the faith gather in congregation to exalt the "creator" of the religion.
I'm not attending any of their services right now.
The Bible has hints and signs that say the pure can enter the faith and co-join with others and that the Creator is the one who is proselytizing religion.
I know what you mean. I live in a big city and I get that feeling too. It is hard to get into it in a city like that.
I have watched football and found that it can keep one's faith, but not despair or anything.
I guess I should watch more football then.
Peace, peace, and prosperity. I have faith in that. I am going to go watch a little football now. Have a blessed day!
You too!  Have a good one!
Hi, are you by any chance a fan of the New England Patriots football team?
Hi, no not really, I know some stuff about Tom Brady though
He is great.  He has a record of 21-0 which is a record
I have not heard much about him, but I know there was a documentary made on him called "Tom vs. Time"
I didn't know that.  I understand that the first episode aired on Facebook in January, but I haven't seen the other stuff.
It's not just a game, it's an important part of his life purpose apparently, and his devotional love of the game is also an importantpart of his devotes.
Agreed, it is. I wonder if he was comfortable using the term "athlete bible" when he dubbed it that. It's still a best-selling book and is dubbed the "Athlete Bible"
yeah, he credits a method called "keeping it together" for keeping on top of the game at age 55.
That was a recent term and I wonder if it applies to Brady.  It disturbs me that some brands use it for their brands.  I saw a commercial for the lifesyle brand and it's a commercial about the TB12 Method.  That disturbs us.
Sounds a bit like a cult, almost like a religion or a religion, but I guess it's just football. Strange.
Agreed. I guess you can be a superfan, but not a religion and not a superfant. I love sports, but it's not religion. It's entertainment and I love it.
It's entertainment, not entertainment, but I think his main goal in life was to live his spiritual life through sports and now he is sad. He was trying to be authentic but now he can only live his spiritually life throughSports.
Mmm, I know what you mean there!  Hey, a lot of people think he's an expert, but I think he was just a jock like a lot.  Like Brady is an expert.  Hey...
It could be true and I agree that he could be trying to say he's a psychology professor.  Sports bring people together in a way that religion can't.  Daniel Wann, a psychology Professor, says that sports bring people closer together than religion.
That's a good point. I think sports divides us. I've been to football, football, and soccer and there were matches where nasty fights broke out.
It really does.  Did you know that the motto of the Patriots is "In Bill we trust"  The motto of The Patriots.
Belichick is the greatest QB/coach of all time and a great QB (Brady) or is Belichick no god? He inflated the balls for the Patriots' Super Bowl 46 game against the Atlanta Falcons and the balls did not get inflated properly and the Falcons were in the game all the time.  The coach, Belichick, is the "greatest coach ever"
I did.  It is true that they have fans who have religious devotion but they are just human.
I've heard that it radically energizes people when a team has the ability to rebound from a deficit and win a Super Bowl in overtime.  We've seen a team come back from a 3-1 deficit and wins the Super Bowl!
I do.  I think that's one way to use fans to describe him a bit.  A kind of messiah.  They use that for their fans to describing him.
I agree. I think Brady has divine inspiration and athletic skills at the center of his great human inspiration and that is at the same time offensive to some devout faithful of other religions, who believe that Brady has Divine inspiration and Athletic skills that would be at the fingertips of devout faithful.
I think they'r some players who have faith in God and want to focus on the team, not themselves.  I think there is a faith in god in every team.
I'm glad to hear that, I hoped it's the other folks who are quietly doing that on and off the field.  I'm glad for the pro bowler Matthew Slater.  He's been mocked for it on the field, mocked by some, mocked even by some evangelical folks, but I'm sure he's glad to be able to do it.  It's the right thing to do with the money he has.
I read that Slater, of the Patriots, is featured on football's national "National Anthem" event on Super Bowl Sunday and is based out of a church based out on outreach to the outreach of his church.
That's good, I don't buy Brady's messianic hype.  It's just a sound bite to get sponsorships, alghough lots of people want to buy Brady Messianic Hype.  He's done so much in life besides his football accomplishments, I'm sure he's gotten sponsorships for all his football accolades.  But that's just one sound bite.
He has done well for himself in his craft. He is arguably the best QB ever and started his career as a 4th round draft pick and is a 6th round pick.
Absolutely, it was great to talk football with him, he has carved into millions of memories, and I think it wasgreat to talk about football as well.
I learned alot from you as well!
What did you like the best ?
Hi, do you watch the NFL?
I love watching football! Did you know the yellow line for the first down is Emmy worthy for ESPN? I enjoy watching it!
Yeah I think that award would be for another award. Who is your favorite player or team?
I love the Green Bay Packers. Did you know they use tracking chips in the players' shoulder pads?
I think that they could use to track velocity, rotation, rotation and such. I hope they can use them to make the game safer.
True the safety impact would be huge.  I am more concerned about womens cheerleaders.  New Orleans is really concerned about women's cheerleaders because of the safety impacting them.
It is very rude and sexist and I wonder why it is in the first place.
I know right, great.  I think they are overpaid football players.  An engineer makes more over their lifetime than an overpaid QB.  Did you know that an engineer makes about 20x as much as a QB?
Yeah I guess their careers are shorter and they don't have the opportunity to make money after they get to be in, so they get the opportunity of a lifetime.
Yes. I think it's surprising how much they make per year. Benjarvus Green-Ellis made so much over his career despite never fumbling once in his whole career.
Yeah that is pretty amazing.  What a talent.  Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink.
I had heard that before. I wonder if the tactic actually works.  Georgia Tech did that once. They defeated Cumberland 222-0.
Wow.  That is a record for only 11 minutes of active game play.
I did not know that. That is insane, considering how long the entire game is. Did you know bowlers used to make more money than football players?
I didn't know that!  I can't even wrap my mind around that.  Off topic but on to another topic, do you know much about the Bible?
I know that Roosevelt and Adams were the last two thought presidents who did not swear in with the bible.
I guess it was optional.  I wonder what kind of Bible Jefferson swore in with?  What kind of bible Jefferson swore with?
I think they probably had the supernatural parts cut out, but not all the supernatural Parts.
I think it was, I think the resurrection part was in the Bible, the miracles and also the miracles of the resurrection, right?
He also believed in Babel because people believe it was based on a real building in Iraq, not just belief in it
Yeah. I would love to see it. Do you know who ETemenanki is?
Hi! Do you watch football?
I love football. I like Tom Brady.  He is one of my favorite players.
He is, and apparently he has some exciting ideals for the future.  Do you think he will have success?
I wond the superbowl, his teammates this year were also successful players and also successful player and they were all his teammates,
Yeah, he is, I hear he owes his success to the avocado ice cream he eats before every game.
 avocado ice cream? doesnt sound like a player with any secret properties, good food for a player,  doesnt sound as if it has any secret Properties
Yeah, maybe that is part of the method.
As good as method is, Brady must win a lot of money to do it.  Bowlers used to make more money in the 60s I guess.
Yeah. I think the Patriots are slighted to win the SB.  Did you see the Superbowl?
The Patriots are a team with a solid base so yeah, it would make sense to watch them win another superbowl but football is a game full with suprises so I don't know if the Patriots will win another Superbowl but it would be a surprise to me.
That's true and I honestly can't think of any one.  I think it's true that the cheerleader is not allowed to stay in the same eating place as the player on every occasion, but they help the team raise money for an occasion.  They help the cheerleaders and the team's raise money to go to the eating place.
I think that is a messed up rule, that is totaly unfair, why can't they just leave, that rule makes me so angry, they can't just leave if they need to, they have to be there first, that's a messedUp rule, I wonder what players think about that, I think that the players would be really angry
Yeah, I don't understand how they can avoid employee fraternization but it is sexist.
That is odd, so is the tracking chips players have embedded in their shoulders and their shoulders.
I had heard about them, but not the players.  I have heard of them watching drones too.
i agree.  Football players suffer brain damage.  We really need to make tech that keeps players protected.  It is taking over the world and taking over our world.  If football doesn't get better, we will end up with more and more football players suffer Brain damage.
I wonder if the movie will ever actually set a limit on how long a players career is before they get the brain damage you mentioned.  It would be like that movie about the braindamage you mentioned, and set a time limit on the brain Damage.
i havent seen it yet, i bet many people in the industry disliked the movie,  what is it called?
Smith played the main character and it's called concussions. The NFL goes to great lengths to help him.
I watched the whole movie,do you know if the movie changed things, I saw only fragments of it,
Not sure if the regulation about helmet to helmet to Helmet changed, or the design of the helmets changed. It was nice chatting with you!
Yes, I hope things can change in the future, nice chatting with you too and I hope something changes soon!
Do you enjoy football?  I do.
I do, college and nfl.  I like Tom Brady and his book the Athletes Bible.
I had no idea he wrote a book. I wonder if he used a ghost writer.
I don't know, maybe it's a little like religion, philosophy and taking care of oneself, or taking care about others.
Taking care of oneself physically, but also having a good family life, too.
Yeah I think you are right, and he is a little on the Pat's (Matthew Slater) and not like the religious entities, he is an evangelist for the religious entity.
Wow! I didn't know that.  I had no idea!  Speaking of football, ESPN won an Emmy for creating the yellow line for first down marks.  Can you imagine not watching a game and not seeing that line?  I wonder what the idea was?
I know that was a nice addition. Bob Ryan, a columnist for the NYT, disliked Brady's belief systems so much that he became a columnist because of it.
Honestly, I've never read the book to make any judgement on it.  I suppose it depends on his reasons for writing it, but I don't think I'd read the books.  He's got his reasons, honestly.  So I don'd rather not read thebook to make anything.
Wow, that's a lot of money. I heard his model wife makes even more money than him.
I heard that, I suppose she is a popular supermodel in the world and I am not even aware of her before that. I suppose in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football players, but at the time, top bowler were not the top football player and top bowlERS made the most of all time.
Yeah, that did change tremendously!  Amazing!  I also saw that Benjarvus Ellis never fumbled once in his NFL career.  Pat on the back pat!
Amazing! He was amazing, I wonder what else he accomplished?
Me either.  Did you know that an average NFL game only has about 11 minutes of actual gameplay?  That's so low, an average nfl game only only has 11 minutes and 17 minutes of actually gameplay!
It is really low, I knew they spent a lot of time on commercials, reviews, but that seems extreme. It's like setting the whole setting to a low, like 11 seconds.
Hee, well, I don't think I've played with them. I've only seen commercials. I do a lot of standing around, so maybe that's why I don's.  Did you know that they're using tracking chips in the shoulder pads and the shoulder pad?  Maybe they're tracking chips from all those tracking chips I'm seeing in the commercials...
I hear about the tracking chips, but I hear it's to help make calls for the players but I wonder if they use the data they get, or rely on reviews to tell if there's any data in the chips or just to use it to make calls on the football. I question why they would use the tracking Chips though.
I think they instrument a lot of stuff like that. It is a way to remove human error, but also to instrument a whole lot of other stuff, like the ball.
I agree.  Did you know that in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top football players?  In the 60s, top bowler made twice what the top football player did.
That changed in the 1960's. The tower of Babel was a real find in Iraq, it is a bible from the Tower of Babel, not a real finding.
I had no idea.  I wonder how they came to that conclusion?
do you watch the NFL?
I do, do you have a favorite player?
I like Brady a lot, what player?
Nice, I love the guy a lot. Do you have a favorite ice cream flavor?
I am not sure, maybe avocado?  He seems like he is dedicated to a super healthy diet.  I wonder if it is just avocado?
Yes he is. He also wrote a book about it.
Yes he has an athlete's bible, I wonder if I can read it.
No, I have not read it.  I will eventually watch it though.  Have you seen the documentary series Tom vs Time?
Did you know Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink?
Yes and the highest score in college football!
It dates back to 1916 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland, 222-0.
Yeah, I wonder if ESPN won an Emmy for that game.
Yeah they won it for the superimposed yellow line, I am so happy for them,
Yes it made game watching at home much easier for me too.
Agreed. Do you know who Banjarvus Green-Ellis is?
Yeah, the guy in NFL who is a legend, never fumbled the ball in his career at all, he is the only guy in nfl who did that, he was a legend
I wonder why that guy did that, and what about that weird rule that the New Orleans cheerleader shave to abide by.  They have a weird rule about that
Yeah, they can not eat in the same restaurant as the players.
Yeah I think that rule is sexist and that they have to leave mid meal if they do not wish to be there, I think the rule is racist, but yeah I don't know.
Agreed, do you know much about the Bible?
I know that is one of the most influential books ever, sold more than 4 billion copies and is one the most important and influential books of all, what about you?
Yeah I know it was part of the education system until late in the 1950s.
Hello, do you watch football? I like the NFL.
I've watched football on TV and read about it. What about you?
Nice! Did you know women can technically play?
Yes women can technically become NFL cheerleaders.  Some things in the bible are so old that men could technically become nfl cheerleaders as well.
I guess so, but speaking of the Bible, did Jefferson make his own version of the bible?
No, I guess that's the crux of the matter, I know it's called a bible but I think it lacks the essence of the bible. Jefferson was a soul, and that's what's at the cruxy.
He was one of the early US presidents. I guess he did believe in the supernatural and the resurrection and miracles of the bible.
I bet Jefferson was one of the first ones to see the miracles in the Bible. I bet Jefferson would be alive today if he had seen them. I guess there is a plot parallel in the bible, where the promise of the miracles failed, but I guess that's a plot that could be alive and well still. Do you watch football at all?
I guess he probably would have been. Do you know why the apple is called as such?
I guess Steve Jobs liked the name, call it what you will, and he was good at it.
Apple and Evil. It originates from the Latin language malus which means "to think".
I never would have guessed that. I would have thought the fruit was evil lurking under the skin, but the company was literally name after an apple. I wonder why they thought the Fruit of the Apple had something evil lurking in it.
I guess so.  Did you know the bible was a required read in elementary schools?
That's too bad.  Jefferson was the first one to have it in schools.  I figure that would have gone better with Jefferson.
Yeah I guess so. Did you know the biblical tower of babel was a real building that exists today as a real tower?
Is it a real tower?  Is it really?  I wonder what Trump thinks of the Babel, I don't know about Trump.
It does say etemenanki in modern day Iraq
I'm surprised a building of that size has lasted so long
I had no idea. I'm just glad it survived. I would be destroyed if I had any idea.  Back to football, do you like it? I don't like games apparently. There's only 11 minutes of active game in the whole history of the games apparently, so I'm glad it's survived.
I guess the players are getting pretty busy on their work day. They have things to attend to on a Sunday, and a work day on a Monday. I hope they don't have to do something like the Jefferson fellow, editing the bible on a sunday.
Yeah, that's true.  Well, nice chatting with you!
hey friend. How are you?
Hi there. Do you watch the NFL games?
Yes, I love watching the NFL games, especially on Sunday's religion, what about you?
Nice I like to watch it too, I didn't know women can play, though!
I did not know that.  I wonder why that is?
I didn't know that either.  Did you know the game only lasts 11 minutes in a game?
My wife is not so strong but she is in the NFL and she is doing strong!
I wonder how much engineers make?  Engineers make more money their football players over the lifetime.
I bet!  I didn't know that.  In the 1960's top bowlers made more money than football players, though.  I wonder if that is good or bad for the NFL depending on the years.  Maybe top bowl players made more, or football players.
Yeah that is insane.  In my lifetime I have seen engineers make more than football players.
That is insane. I would not think that an engineer would be able to make more money.
Yeah I guess it is a good profession. Did you hear about nfl using tracking chips on the players?
I did not know that! I wonder why they are doing that, why not shoulder pads?
Yeah they are, they track velocity, rotation, and other stuff, and they also have a bunch of other stuff on them too.
Wow, I wonder how much they made, engineers who make a lot of money are known to make a a lot.
I think so.  ESPN won an emmy for it so it has a good chance.  Did you know ESPN won one?
No I did not, did they have a yellow line?
Yeah the superimposed line, I guess that deserves an award. Back in the day, bowlers used to make more money than football players back in the 60s, do you know that?
I believe it. Well, good chatting with you!
Yeah, I wonder how many claim it. Nice chatting with you too!
Bye!  :) 
Goodbye!  You too!
Do you watch the NFL games?
I love the NFL and try to follow all 32 teams, do you?
Nice, well the game season is only about 17 weeks and its a long time and lots of games, 20 game season,
It is, but it is fast when one team plays on a 16 game schedule and the other team plays a 17 game schedule.
Yeah, it is interesting that bowlers used to make twice as much as football players in the 1960s, I think.
They used to make more than the players? I wonder how much they make now
I think in the time football was the most popular, engineers still make more than average football players.  Today I think it is the average football player.
I think it's because they have a longer career and are better in the long run. It's crazy that the highest scoring game ever was in 1916 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0.
That is insane. ESPN got an Emmy for it.
I didn't know that. How did they win it?
They did it for inventing the superimposed yellow line. That is pretty strange.
Interesting.  Did you know that Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled once in his NFL career?  That's pretty incredible.
Yes that is.  I wonder if women can play too?  Women can play if they have the talent.
Yes I read that somewhere.  I think that if they meet the eligibililty requirements they can play as long as they do not have to meet the rule that says they cannot play.
Yeah, I hope not, it's a weird rule.  I wonder if that is the same rule for the New Orleans cheerleaders?  I think they have a weirdrule.
No, what is that?
Football players are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the football players.
That's an odd rule, but they are probably paid enough to do it. The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay, and they get paid a lot for that. I wonder what happens in the average NFLGame. I think there's only 11 minutes or so of actualGameplay.
Yeah it doesn't seem like that long, but it is so strange to think we are glued to the tv for so long. On another topic, do you know much about the Bible?
It is the best selling book of all time with total sales of over 8 billion copies and the bestselling book of our time withtotal sales of more than 6 billion copies.
Yeah that is a lot, Jefferson apparently made his own version of the bible, a version that was not the one in the Bible
I wonder if Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams did, they were the only two US Presidents who did not use a bible when they were sworn in and sworn in as president, Teddy Roosevelt was one of them
Yeah I wonder why they didn't use the Bible. Jefferson did, maybe because he saw it as supernatural.
Good evening!  It's a cold night inside with what seems like blizzard like conditions.  I'm thinking about breaking out the Bible.  Think I will.  It is such a cold, cold night outside and I'm Thinking about breaking in my Bible.
I live in FLORIDA, I wont rub it in my face.  I am running out of everything to do.   I wont Rub that in your face!
LOL, I guess I could try altering my Bible like President Thomas Jefferson.  I guess he was not fond of things like miracles or resurrection so he used a different version of the bible.
I heard that too, picking and choosing what parts to follow and what not.  I wonder if presidents use a razor to get sworn in and then razor off?  I know some presidents do.
Wow! I thought that was a new one, I wonder if any of the presidents were ever sworn in with a bible, I thought it was just a happen to be a Constitution.
I know Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams had a special bible. Im surprised Jefferson isnt one.
I agree. I wonder if there were other iterations of the Bible, such as apocryphal, that each president used, or if they just made a decision about what a denomination considers canon.  I doubt it was arbitrarily because every president has his own Bible, but I wonder how they would have made up their own Bible?  There are many iterations of these books, and I wonder what each denomination considerscanon, if not apocrypha.
True.  Catholics include it, Protestants dont.  But they do remove parts.  I think the Catholics have had their parts removed.  Some decisions are just decisions,  like how the Protestants dont want to have parts removed,  others are more serious, and that is what the Catholics want.
I think a lot were based on church councils, and a lot of them are based on Church councils that were codified in the New Testament most Christians agree on, but it's just a different story.  I don't know what name the Catholics use today.  It's not the New testament most Christians know.
The translation of the word apple is interesting. Have you heard of the translation?
No, I have not, but I would be interested in hearing more about that.
In Latin, the word malus meant both apple and evil, so it was translated as such. I wonder if that meant both Apple and Evil.
Interesting. That is true. But I find other things more interesting, like the tower of Babel. Granted, it is based on an old building in modern day Iraq, but it was probably based on the tower that was used for Apple's first building in today's Iraq, which is not true.
I think biblical history is pretty cool.
I agree, I never really studied it in elementary school but the bible was the norm for most of my time there so I guess it was always something that was studied. I wonder if the next generation will ever agree, or will it become more of a norm that the old generation had in elementary School.
I think that is a part of all schooling.
That's probably part of Tom Brady's (and others') personal belief system these days, or his personal belief System?
I've never heard of that. I wonder why it's called that?
It is, but I guess it is not the athlete's bible.  It seems cultish in some ways.  In the athlete bible, athletics is not mentioned or even mentioned.
For Patriots fans it is like a messiah, or at least the messiah of the patriots fans
I'm sure he is ready to follow his beliefs off the field, doubting his accomplishments, but it can be unnerving when you're not ready to following his beliefs on it.
No, I agree.  Ive got to get going, nice chat.
Hello, are you a football fan?
I am, I've been a Chiefs season ticket holder for over a decade and moved to the Boston area a few years ago.  I'm not much of a football fan myself, but I've seen a lot of football in both college and pro.
That's good.  A college team once defeated their opponent 222-0.  I'm not sure what that means.
Yes.  That school at Illinois had a lot of losing football.  They did not want to set up a game that would be on top of the school.  I am surprised they could do that. scoring over 200 points in a game seems impossible with the way things are going now.  scoring that many points seems impossible, but a bowller in the 1960s made more in a year than a football star.  Maybe it was a lot more like a bowler who made it to the top of a lot  of losing Football stars.
I am a sports fan, but I am outraged at those salaries. What about you? Are you outraged at the salaries?
It's surprising that the average engineer's life time earnings is higher than the average NFL and MLB player's earnings, yet the average Engineer's lifetime earnings is much lower than the life time incomes of an average NFL & MLB player.
Yeah NFL careers are shorter and with injuries too.  An MLB player could get $8 million a year for ten years and still get only $6 million.  I would think it would be more.
I think that there is an upside to that. In other societies, they would be suffering so much more. They could play a kids game for $5 million to play a Kids game. I am surprised at the gameplay in the average NFL game. There is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in an average NFL Game.
I know what you're thinking! I can't even imagine what they are thinking when there's only 11 minutes of gameplay.  That's hours of practice.
Yep, that's why it's so sad. They should have studied their brains. Some of the older players even showed signs of "Truama syndrome" when they showed signs from the sport and the researchers said it's the same as in the 60s, but the older they played, the more they showed up with it, so that was the reason they had to have it done. It's so barbaric for national TV revenue, entertainment, and entertainment value.
i figure that we should do more to make the sport safer. that would make the game much better for everyone.
I know. We're still paying lip service to the Gothic Chopra assertion that the NFL akin to "modern religion". I don't know if I'd live outside Boston for that.
Well, I like the community competition idea, but people get pretty radical defending their teams.  I think it's the competition idea.
It is like a border line religion.  I know a couple of Alabama Crimson Tide alumni.  The University of Iowa is trying to work on a "border line religion" with the University of Alabama.
I think that is kind of funny, too. I think it fasinates people. I love watching violence, especially in football, boxing, boxing and the MMA. I really love watchingviolence.
I wonder if we should examine the "lizard brain" or "Colusium" to see if it draws in other drives like the Roman gladiators blood or if it is the "Lizard Brain" that draws in the boxing and MMA.  Football has a lot of fans.  I think it caters to a lot more than just boxing and UFC. It drives in the Roman GLadiators' blood.
You nailed it. I wonder if we have changed much from the Roman gladiators, I mean society has, but I don't think it has changed much for the better.
There were a few women soccer matches that looked like they could get good, there was a woman kicker in the nfl, but the nFl had no explicit rule against women, but it was a women kicker.
I think there has never been a woman president, but I do not think there will ever be a women kicker.  I don't think they are good enough to be good enough.
I think there will be, but I wonder what positions they would be in. Maybe a place kicker? I mean society has certainly evolved to where it has evolved from the place kicker to other positions
Agreed.  Good conversation!
Hello, do you like Tom Brady?
I love him, he is such an inspiration, i want to read his book, "The Athlete's Bible" I am going to lobe to read it,
I have not read his "athlete's bible" yet, but it is a best seller.
The bible is the best selling book of all time.
Thomas Jefferson was the first to believe in miracles and the resurrection.  I wonder if he made up his own miracles, and if the Bible had anything to do with it.
Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams were two of them.
It is intresting how the word malus comes from the word apple and evil, and not apple and good
I know right? I did not know females could play for the NFL, did you know that?
No I dont, I dont think any can.  But the cheerleaders are forbidden from eating at the same restaurant as any NFL player, and even in the same store as an NFL player.  I wonder why.
That's crazy.  I wonder why they have to leave if a player is in there?  They should just have to just leave if they're already there!
It is, but I think it's cool that ESPN made the yellow line to help you see where the first down is.
That is cool. They also put tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record moves.
I wonder if they put one in the footballs to record data.
Yes. Do you know how many teams in the NFL are in the nfl now?
I think it's because of the games having to be on a bye week and each team playing only two games and each having a bye WEEK.
The rest of the gameplay, well only 11 minutes of live gameplay and the rest is just commercials lol,  I wonder why there are so many commercials lol
Good point. Did you know that in the 60's bowlers made twice as much as top football stars?
That is crazy. Engineers make more over the lifetime than they do though, about $300000 per lifetime
I know right.  I saw a crazy Cumberland game where they walked off the field, and then they walked back in.  That's crazy
I would have walked too, even if it was by 222 points!
I will definitely enjoy Tom Brady and his videos, have a good day, enjoy TomBrady and his Videos!
Hello - today is all about football for us today. Did you hear anything about Tom Brady and his religion? Did you like him?
No I didn't.  That sounds intriguing.  How did he start that religion?  It sounds intriguing
He has a plan to help him get to peak performance and keep good health, and to boot, he throws in an avocado for every ice cream after every game.  Tom Brady has a "plan" for their lives which includes joy, good health and peak performance.  He has a new avocado for each ice cream plan that he throws into the air after every one of his throws.
I wonder if it is a god-given fruit or if he is trying to ruin ice cream.
The athlete's bible, called "The Lifestle Method," is Brady's best-selling "Athlete Bible" which he credits with helping him stay on top of the game at age 30 and to become the success he is.  I wonder if he has a method called "the game of life" that he credits for helping him Stay on top.
I have not heard of that, is it a special method for people? is it something he does?
Well, I'm not sure if it's for me. I'm on a spiritual quest for the answer.  I don't know how well it would work.  But I do know Tom Brady apparently is doing it for his vocation.  Brady apparently stands at 6-foot-6 and stands at 200 pounds and is known for his devotion and devotion to winning the game.  He loves the game, but also believes that winning is the purpose of life and the meaning of his life and that the game is his way of finding that vocation, which stands for "spiritual quest".  I wonder if he's getting points for his work, or if the game's just a game to get to the right answer?
I am glad for Tom he has found his calling, he wants to spread the calling and I am glad he found his called.
Do you use Facebook?  I have a Facebook watch, and one of the first episodes looked at Brady's mental and physical preparation for the series which started on Jan. 1, 2018.  It's a look at Brady mental andPhysical preparation for a series which is a must see.
Sounds intriguing!  I guess Tom likes to read the bible.  I wonder if he's ever made it into the read the Bible.
I have, the Bible is an intricate inspiration from God to how humans came about on earth.  It is an amazing example of intricate inspiration.
I've read the bible. I know the person that wrote it didn't think it was fromGod. He made money off it.
It was probably the best-selling book every written, so he definitely had a choice. It has sold over 5 billion copies. It was estimated that it was the best-, best- selling book every Written in 2014,
I hope it is still one of the best copies! The person who wrote it should get paid for the copies. I wonder how much money that would be for the authors. Do they get money?
Hey, I figure that they did. Did you know that the University of Iowa football team locker room is completely painted pink?  I wonder why?  The football team's locker room
Didn't paint it pink just so they wouldn't lose a bet?
Probably just a bet. Wild that in the 1960's top bowlers got paid more than top football stars. I wonder how much top bowler's got paid?
I guess bowling is more challenging than I thought. I respect bowlers and I respect them.
That's funny!  Football is so exciting and so exciting to me too!  I can't believe it's only been so long since the game!  Do you watch much football?  The highest score ever in a game was back in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222 to 0!  Funny to think that happened over 100 years ago and that's the highest score in a football game.
That would be terrible.  helmets are essential to game.  The other team has to look terrible to get the victory.  Helmets are essential.
Yes that would be a shame if that happened. It's so cool that I found out that espn won an emmy for superimposing that yellow line representing the first down line for american football games. I didn't even know that was possible.
Hello!    Do you watch the NFL?
I do, apparently Tom Brady has made football his religion
He is great at that.  I bet that avocado ice cream is a good way of staying in shape.
Yeah I think he does, avocado is not belong in ice cream, it does not belong on ice cream!
No, I don't think they do. Do you know a book author?
Yeah I heard he is, I think he has a athletes bible. Have you read it?
I have not, but apparently it has helped him.
He's married to Gisele? I hear she makes twice as much as him. That can't hurt, can it?
Yeah, she is the most famous worls model.
Did you know that the Patriots are still slated to win the next Super Bowl, but it's early in the year. I wonder who they are slated to won?
I'm surprised they haven't gone yet.  I think they're pretty good.  Do you think women can play in the NFL?  I know women can played in the 1960's and they are pretty good!
Yes, I am not surprised. I have attempted to do that myself and personally I would like to see it. I wonder if it is a league like the NBA? I personally don't see how that is possible.
I don't watch much TV, did you knowESPN won an Emmy?
No, I didn't know that lol, I would have to approve that yellow line made my life easier!
True. Off topic but do you know much about the bible?
I know that Thomas Jefferson made a name for the bible by defiling it
Yeah, and he did it with a razor.  What about the supernatural stuff?
I see.  I wonder if that was a nonfiction book.  Did you know that presidents have not sworn in with a bible since 1853?  I would think all presidents would use a bible to be sworn in.
Roosevelt and Quincy.  I wonder why they believed it?
Yeah I guess not.  They pinky swear that they never did.
haha good one, I wonder why the word apple was used?
The original word was translated into Latin, but when that word was translate into Latin it was biblical and it meant both evil and apple. The original word meant both. Well, it was nice chatting with you!
Yeah,  have a good one.
Did you know that Tom Brady's "The Athlete's Bible" is the best selling book?
No, what is he talking about?  Is it a method?
Yep it is.  It is equated to spirituality, and religion.  Sports brings people together and I think staying on top of being an athlete can be equated with religion.
I bet it does, staying healthy and on top of the game. But I think they have an audience for that and they know how to keep on top, I bet.
Yeah, Pats fans see Brady as the messiah, and in Bill we trust.  Reflecting on coach belichick, Pats Fans see the QB as the Messiah.
I can see how Bill an Tom would want a creed to recite, though I understand the reverence they have afforded these guys in a game where winning is a goal, not a creed. The Pats have won 8 superbowls in his lifetime, and I believe Bill an tom have won 6. I think that is more reverence than most would have afforded a player in a lifetime, even in agame where winning the Superbowl is thegoal.
It's cult-like, even though it's not cult-Like.  Bob Ryan, the columnist, said it's "top to top."  reverence for the QB is "cult-like"
Football fans often border on idol worship each Sunday. I think it makes them vulnerable to wanting something to fill their hearts and minds with something bigger than themselves, a religion, a bigger purpose than themselves. It makes them want to fill the whole with idol worship.
Yeah, I know. I guess in most of the world, we call it football, but Americans call soccer. I wonder what kind of goal in common with that? I know that kicking the ball is what Americans call it, but what kind? What kind ofgoal do you think is used?
Spirituality is in depth in the words of Eric, Olympic champion runner and "the pleasure of God"  I find inspiration in athletic performance and success, but also in the depth of the words  of Eric who was a "pleasure of God", "to find inspiration from my own spirituality".
He is dedicated, I think that's why he's so well dedicated. I can't believe that in the 1960's top pro bowlers were paid more than pro football players were paid.
Good point, I'm sure they would sue for the money, Brady is a true believer though, he doesn't like to get any more money, he just wants to keep the dedication going, he is a good point.
It's not all good pay though.  The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay.  Seems low for someone who does what he does.  But, it is good pay for an average NFLgame that only has about 11 minutes.
Yeah, but it is fun to watch! Brady is an anomaly, but the average engineer has a lower lifetime earning potential than the average NFL player, and the average Engineer. So, yeah, Brady has more potential for one game than theAverage Engineer, but still, he's an anomaly.
Brady is definitely in the top 5 for sure, but if you are an engineer, it's probably not as much.
I wonder if Brady's wife would go on the field.  The NFL has no rule against female players.  They pass minimal eligibility requirements.  I wonder if she woulod be able to play in the NFL?  Brady's wives could play.  There is no ruleagainst female players,  they just have to pass minimal eligibilities requirements.
I wouldn't hold your breath, but there is a supermodel that makes twice what she made as a running back for her alma mater.  Kind of shameful that she could beat poor Cumberland 222-0 when they beat her.  They had no running back and she was a supermodels.
I know right, that is shameful, that must have been a brutal game loss, I went to Iowa, they have a pink visitors locker room so they can return from a brutal loss like that, I wonder if they have that in their visitors lockerroom when they return from such a brutal lost,
Yeah that is shameful, just like it is shameful that kids no longer read from the Bible in elementary school.
I think half the kids still use it, but I think it is one of the most sacred texts they can read these days and I am sure more than half theKids don't like that
Sadly that is true. Thanks for the chat.
Do you like football? What do you think about it?
Yes, I like football, classic struggle to put the ball in the goal, the goal is always the same with football.
I like football too,  I heard of it before.  Do you know Tom Brady?  Do they like him?
Tom Brady is an interesting personality.  He is a very efficient quarterback with 20 super bowl wins in the last 16 years and is the most efficient quarterback in the Super Bowl with 6 Super Bowl wins.
He is definitely a player of his time and a player that is still around.  40 years is quite a time to be in the game.  I think there is still some time in the age of the game, so maybe he has a few years left in him.
That's a good question. I think a documentary series, Tom vs Time, could shed some light on Toms remaining time. Maybe it'll be like a Tom vs TIME documentary series.
i havent seen that one, is that a documentary worth watching,  I wonder if there are any interesting facts about Brady,  interesting facts?
There are interesting things about him, Belichick, and people who say they worship sports and think they are simply fans of it. They think that sports are their religion and they worship Belichick.
I guess it makes sense.  Fans do worship sports.  Deepak Chopra had a comment supporting the saying "we worship sports"
That's an interesting idea, using sports as religion. It's like using money to make a saint. I think the NFL is a team team, and not just a team. I wonder if they have a saint, running back Benjarvus Green-Ellis, who never fumbled once in his entire career, would like to make it to the NFL. That would be a interesting idea.
I think players like him and the players like that really sets themselves apart, he sets himself up as a saint or something. If his value were higher I loved to watch him play.
It is a minor miracle that when espn superimposes a yellow line on the field to show the first down line on TV, espnSuperman superimpose a yellow lines on the playing field to shows the first downs.  That's worth an emmy!
I think it is a great contribution to the Gods, I guess when you sacrifice yourself for a religion it makes sense, the game is about sacrifice, and 222-0 can translate to the slayer of the gods, so I guess it is not a great contributions, but it is still a great addition to the game and it has a great value to the gods.
Ohh...random, random, and the result of a dice.  Back in the day and Cumberland wasn't worth much at all.  Georgia Tech was only worth $5 back in the Day and Cumberlanders worth $200.  Now we have Georgia Tech worth $100,000,000.  I don't know.  Maybe Tom Brady will be worshiping in the future as a result.
There are some dedicated players in the NFL though.
I don't know. Tom has the drive, dedication and commitment to do what he does.
Yeah, I agree.  Brady is a bit of a bit behind in his game but has had a few years, but yeah, he's been great in the Super Bowl and the SB.
Tom is probably transitioning to a nutritional guru. He has the cash to do so. Football is about money.
I agree that is a valid theory and he makes a lot of money, but I also think he makes too much. I think a positive perception of sports bring in the most persons, and I think he is great for a positive Perception of sports. I also agree he is the best version of himself, he definitely makes a LOT of money.
Yes, and the technology involved in the NFL may make advances as well.  They are tracking chips in the shoulder pads and the chips in players shoulder pads to help with closed head injuries.  The NFL may be able to make advances in this way.
Yeah footballs have some tracking chips too, and there is a lot of interesting data from those,
Hi, how are you? Are you familiar with the football?
I know some of the stuff.  Do you have a favorite player/
I like the Patriots, do you follow teams?
Nice, I'm a fan of Tom Brady.  How about you?
I like him but I do like Green Ellis more
Benjarvus is another legend, the guy never fumbled the ball once in his career and he was a legend!
How so? I wonder how he did that
Did you know the highest score ever in a game was 222 to 0!
I do not! What was it?
Yeah, like 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland.
Man how good were they, how bad was Cumberland?
Yeah.  I know ESPN won an Emmy.
No I did not know that. Do you know Green Ellis?
Yes.  He won so many that the superimposed yellow line is a awesome way to tell watchers where they won.
It is.  There are only 11 minutes of live action in a dozen.  That's hard to digest with only 11.  It's hard for me.
Yeah, that is too short. It is strange that the NFL is so short. Women can play too.
I did not know that. I wonder why there is no written rule against them?
Yeah.  I think it would be a better idea to make a living as an engineer, or at least a better Idea to make $$$
Yes, but there is significantly less chance of force retirement due to injuries.
That is true. On a different topic do you know why they have the bib?
I don't.  It's not really a religion.  They have not decided it's own religion. In any case, it's been nice chatting with you about religion.
Have a good one. I will
Hi, how are you?
Im great, are you an NFL fan?
I like the NFL, the National Football League.  I haven't been to a game in a while, but I've heard of the game.
Me either.  I don't have a favorite team so I have to choose just one.  Do you have a favorites?
I do not have a favorite, I do not show favor, that would be sinful and I am sinful, do you have a favorites?
I do like my favorite team, I favor the Vikings, college football, do you?  The Iowa Hawkeyes are my favorite, they painted their visitor's locker room pink.
I did not know that.  I like that they are encouraging awareness of breast cancer.
That is a valid point, and psychological for calming down the team.
I guess it is, but footballers are not calmed by pink so it does remind me of the tragedy of cancer that strikes so often, and remind me that footballers can't help.
That is good awareness, I never knew that so many male players were affected.
I figure that the game is carcinogous, so the Breast protector for the game would be a pounding.  I know breasts are delicate things, but I'm an engineer and don't need a breast protector.
I know engineers make more money overtime than NFL players!  Engineers make more time overtime than nfl players.
Engineers do better than players because they are engineers.  Iowa demands that all players have a breast cancer preventor breast plate.
Engineers have created chips to put in shoulder players for data purposes, I wonder when they'll start using those.
The chips are clever and they can detect breast cancer too.  That's a good start.  Maybe they can spread pink awareness too.
Sounds like a sound way to go about it, she is a good advocate for those affected by breast cancer, and she is very good.
No I have not. I played when I played and I wore the breast protectors. Thank God I never suffered from it but I wish I had.
I am happy to hear that.  That was good for you.  Speaking of women in the NFL, do you play in the nfl?
I did not know that, although I know that they incur a tremendous risk of breast cancer. I think that we should take care to avoid them as much as possible, for the most part. Carcinogens abound in pro football and we should all take care of that, as well.
I agree with that. Do you watch espn at all?
Yes, I do. They have a pink line to raise awareness about breast cancer.
Yes, the yellow line that is pink during October. It was good chatting with you about pink and the yellow lines, thanks!
Hey there, do you like football?
I used to watch quite a bit of it when I was younger, I like football and just sports in general. Do you watch?
I do like football and I learned a few interesting facts about football a while ago a few weeks ago when I was visiting the NFL.  Here are some interesting facts:  The Iowa locker room for the visiting teams is painted pink.  I did not know that.
That is surprising, previously the women's locker room was the school's colors, I think.
I would have thought it was a joke and that is what it meant, but I think it is more like a color that is breaking down gender norms. The idea of football and pink is typically thought of as feminine, but the idea offootball is actually kind of a joke.
Agreed. I was fascinated to learn that the NFL doesn't allow female players. They only have to meet the league's eligibility for the NFL. I am fascinated to see what they come up with.
I have no idea, I'm guessing there is a stigma against it, but I can see ladies playing football, there is no stigma. I have to give props to the NFL though, they are trying.
I have heard that before but I don't think people would want to try it.  I would think that people would be rooting against Brady's team all the time, but it's kind of like rooting for someone who works hard to keep winning all thetime.
I guess RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis is one of the good players of the NFL, he never fumbled the football in his NFL career.
That is pretty impressive, I wonder how he got those skills, and he must be paid a lot, I didn't realize that top bowlers used to be made more than football stars.
I had no idea.  That is interesting and I had no ideas.
I'm not sure but it probably was the last thing they did. Bowling is more popular now and it no longer is a thing.
I think a lot of things were more popular back then.  Like roller skating, diners, and church.  The bible wasn't as popular back in the 1700s, but still it was popular for a lot.  Do you like Roller skating?
Good point.  I recently learned that Jefferson used a razor to cut out supernatural parts of the bible, and it's funny he never mentioned the bible.
That is weird!  I guess things were different back then.  Back in the US, every elementary student was required to read the bible.  I wonder why?
Wow! That is so funny, it is funny that there is an uproar today because of a short timeframe, but I think society approves of that and it's because of how society is in an uproar Today.
I guess not, but apparently Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams were both super religious and used a bible at their swearing-in ceremonies.  Apparently Roosevelt and Adams were the only two to do so.  I guess they were both really into the bible.
That is very interesting.  Did you know that the tower of Babel is actually based on a real building in Iraq?  The tower of babel?
Hmm, makes sense, I guess the Bible is a best-selling book, but times are changing, I wonder if it makes sense.
Yeah, I bet Tom Brady hopes his book will surpass it though...
I sure hope so for his own sake as well! Well, this conversation was enlightening. I hope you also enjoyed it and enjoy your night.
You as well! Thanks.
I am going to start watching the NFL again.
Me too!  Thanks!
Do you watch the NFL?
The NFL? The National Football League?
Yeah I watch it a bit but not much. Did you know U of Iowa painted their visitor locker room pink?
I heard that and I wonder how that worked and if it was effective for the teams if it worked.
Yeah that is a good point.  There is only 11 minutes of active game play, I wonder if it would help with that?
I guess that means a lot of setting up, moving the chains and stuff.
Yeah, it is. Do you know what the highest score in college football game ever was?
That was in 1916, I can't imagine it was very high, but it was that long ago, I think.
Yeah, and it was 222-0 when georiga tech beat cumberland.
That says a lot about football seems unfair.  New Orleans Saints cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant, if they are already dining in the restaurant, and an NFL player comes in, and they are required to leave if the nfl player comes into the restaurant.  Seems unfair.
That is wrong and sexist. I wonder how ESPN won an Emmy for that rule.
ESPN has been around a long time. They won it in 1989.
Yeah, they should have won with the superimposed yellow line.
That line is a bit too simple to deserve an award, I wonder why that line is on the screen, it seems a bit far from the screen
Yeah for sure, what do you think about Benjarvus Green-Ellis by the way?
I have heard of him, but I do not know him. He is famous for being famous for something else?
Yeah he is a RB. He has never fumbled the ball in his career.
Wow, that is impressive, I guess every defense needs to hope that he is coming up soon. He will get a raise or a bonus or something, I wonder if he will get it, I know he will be getting a raise, I think, I would think.
I honestly don't know. I just hope he was.  There is no rule that prevents women from playing for the NFL.  I think there should be a rule that forbids women fromPlaying.
I don't know about that rule, I think the bar is way too high physically.  I'm not sure if they can get up that high physically or not.  Anyway, thanks for the chat!
Same here, have a great one!
Do you like football?  I really do.
I have a passing knowledge of it, but I do not know much about it.
The highest scoring game ever was 222-0. Did you watch that?
That is too bad, I would have been on the winning team. I wonder if the losing team was doing good or bad.
Maybe. The NFL allows a player to play only about 17 minutes per game.
I think I saw that one time. That's not a lot of action.
Do you think the NFL will have rules against women?  I don't think they will anytime soon, but I don'm not sure if the NFL has any rules against them.
Maybe, but I wonder if the requirements inherently disqualify them for some reason
It could be.  Maybe it's not as much about allowing them in the league but about sexist rules about cheerleaders.  The league has sexist rules that don't allow them to eat in the same restaurant as the players.
They do?  I think that is unfairly biased, I think they have to do what is best for them.
yeah, strange rule. I did watch the playoffs and super bowl this year. Did you watch the Playoffs and Super Bowl?
Yes, I did, the opening was a bit disappointing compared to years prior, but not too disappointing compared in the later part.
Yeah, the playoffs were nerve wrecking.  There is a player who has never fumbled the ball in his career.  He has never once due to fumbles in his whole career.
No, I did not know that, who was that? Green Ellis?
Yeah I do like him, and speaking of records, I mess it up sometimes but the Patriots have won back-to-back super bowls, talk about pressure, they've won 3 out of the last 4. It's pretty amazing.
I know right, they are the lanisters of football for sure
Brady has never won more than one playoff games, and his coach has never even won one.  I think that his team has a shot, but it is not shot.
I know right, this team is full of talent like previously Green Ellis, not to mention QB,
True.  I would like to live like Tom Brady has developed a new method that teaches people how to live.  It's a method called, "the way to the next Tom".  He has a method that's teaches people.  Well, it was nice chatting with you!  Have a great weekend!
I agree with you, thank you!
I will look into it. Thanks!
Hi there! How are you tonight? It's not uncommon in the 1960's for students in the us to be required to read the bible as part of their elementary education.
I do read it every now and then, but I'm guessing that tradition ended around the time people protested about prayer in schools.
It would make sense.  The separation of the state and the Bible is in the US Constitution.  Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams both said that the bible was the Constitution, so it would make the most sense.
Interesting. That's a recent one, I think it's the first to be sworn in without a bible.
That tradition is important in today's political climate. In colonial times, Thomas Jefferson created his own bible, cutting out the "supernatural" parts of the Bible in it.
I would like to see the etemenanki building in person. I think it would be awesome to see it. The referenced tower of babel, the tower of Babel, would end up being the damage. I have never seen the building inperson, but I think you can see the referenced tower from an end.
I think that would make sense with the Bible having connection to places in the middle east, but not sure.  It is the Middle East, after all.
That would make sense.  The root for apple is the word for apple in the word in Latin.  People assume that Eve ate an apple and evil comes out of it.  It seems strange that so many people assume that eve ate an Apple.
True, easy to get confused by that. On another topic, do you follow the NFL at all?
I follow it not too closely, but I heard Tom Brady released a book about it.  He dubbed it the "Athletic Bible".  I wonder what it is all about?  I heard tom brady released aBook?
Interesting.  What's the book or Brady's?  What is a bible for athletes?
I like the Patriots, due to their constant winning, due in part to his constant winning.  I don't follow any other teams in the NFL, just the Patriots.  Do you?
Yes, I do follow them, although I don't have time to watch them much except for the playoffs. I try to watch when I get the chance during the season.
Yes, I'm in the same boat, I like the regular season but don't like the playoffs aspect. I like games up until the Super Bowl and then the games before the Super bowl, you?
I figure that the playoffs have more energy and more time to pay attention.  I think that the average NFL game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay.  The season is a total of 16 hours of live play and only 5 minutes in the playoffs is enough time to paid attention.
I do the math and I think it's 32 weeks not counting the single elimination playoff games including the wildcards, so 32 teams play 16 teams in 16 weeks not count the single Eliminated playoff games.
Did you know that the NFL uses tracking chips in the players shoulder pads to record how the player moves.  They also use them to record the velocity of the ball when the player is on the field and the rotation of the field.  It also record the location of where the ball is when a player is in the field, velocity, velocity and rotation.
I think they are really smart, they have the systems in place to be able to track that. The engineers who had to create the chips are probably making them in comparable lifetimes to the NFL players, and the engineers must be able the track so much in those comparable lifecycle that they create the Chips.
I hope so. Engineers should be more engineers, and athletes should be less athletes. We want to have a good society.
Very true. Did you know that there is no rule that keeps women from playing?  If they meet eligibility, they can.  That's pretty cool.
I guess we'll see what the future brings for a woman, a great chat! I guess I will go now, have a great evening, woman.
Yes, it would be an interesting game, and I think its going to be an really interesting game!
Hello, do you have any favorite quarterbacks? Mine is Peyton Manning, he's amazing. I would say he's close to being up there with Tom Brady for my favorite.
I guess my favorite is Ben, but I am not a steeler fan so I respect him, I guess there are so many great QBs, I like both guys and I guess my favorites are a steelers fan and a steelER, I respect both!
I didn't hear that Tom Brady wrote a book. Did you hear that? I heard that he did a thing, but I didn't know he wrote a "Athletes Bible". I wonder if it is the athlete's bible?
I did hear that, but I wonder if it is a publicity stunt or if it will make more money for him. I would think so.
I don't know if he will continue.  If he can start with that much money, then why not?  He can always start when he retires and keep going until he gets enough money.
I guess that is the jocks view. I dont know what is going on in his case. I guess he could get something substantial from it. The athletes bible is an athletes bible.
I agree! I thought it was something that everyone would agree on. Did you know that an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay?
Yeah, it seems like there is a lot of waiting around and no play. Those 11 minutes are pretty exciting though, but still.
I agree, I like how the NFL uses tracking chips to record speed, rotation, and other things. The ball is also used to record rotation.
Yeah, that is what they put in the players shoulder pads. I guess they want that technology for better technology.
It's kind of scary. Did you know that a New Orleans Saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if an NFL player comes in?  They have to leave if an nfl player comes into the restaurant.
I dont see why that rule is in place in the first place.  I think there is a rule that they should be allowed to be there all the time.  If they are dating they should not be allowed in.
There is no written rule against female players as long as they met the eligibility requirements. The NFL has no written rules against female player as long they are in the top 3 or even above.
I have heard that a woman could be able to play. She can just have to be fit and ready. I think that only a few percent of men are gifted to be able and can play. I know that there are a few who are at the top of their position but not the top 60 percent. The nfl needs a woman at the QB position because not many men are talented or fit andReady.
Hard to say. I think an engineer would be the best one. I know the average lifetime earnings are higher for an NFL player and MLB player. I wonder if a woman would have an average lifetime earning like a woman does as an NFL or an MLB player?
That is pretty surprising to hear.  I figured they would be in the top of the category of the top earners but they dont make that much,  they probably bring that average down a lot since they dont have to make as much as the players.  They were making over $200 million in a year so I figured it would not be that much.
I heard that in the 1960's top bowlers made more than football stars.
Bowling was still a big sport back in the day, football players didnt make as much, they deserved it though, there was no players union back in those day, the best players didnt even make it to the top of the list for a players union, they could just play football.
I agree.  Did you know that the former Patriots Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled one game in his NFL career.  He never fumbles in his whole NFL career!
He must have done a lot of upper body strength training.  He must have prayed hard every night that he wouldn't fumble.  I wonder if he does a lot more of that now.  Must be a lot, or maybe he has a lot better of upper Body strength training to keep going strong.
I agree!  I hope you have a great night!
Hi, how are you?
Hey! I hope you are doing well! What do you think of Tom Brady's new book? I like his method. Do you like the method?
I do not know Tom Brady, but I know the name of the author.
Yes, he is an author of sorts.  He's a long-time fan of the New England Patriots football team and a long time long- time coach of the game.  I think he has written a book of some sorts. He is regarded as one of the greatest QBs of all time and one of those that are still going strong at 40 yrs old.  And he had a book explaining why he is regarded by many as one the greatest Quarterbacks of all-time.
Sounds like an important book, I will have to read it, I hear its an importantbook.
I haven't read it, but would be interested in having a copy.  New England Patriot fans seem to deify Brady and even Belichick.  Belichick, as the coach of the Patriots, is the "church" of the patriots.  He has made the Patriots my religion and is the coach who has given them the most NFL championships.  I have to say, the last 20 years with 8 NFL championships is incredible.  So, I am not interested in the New England Patriots.  They are not my religion, but I would like to read it.
That is incredible.  He's practically a deity, I guess.  I guess he has earned his status as a holy tract of the heavens.  That book is a holy tracts, that is for sure.
I don't understand what idolatry is. I don't think I would approach that level of religious zeal.  One thing the phrase "In Bill we trust" isn't is an earned sentiment.  It's a well-worn sentiment in Boston, but it's one that doesn't really understand what idols are.  I've never seen anyone approach thatlevel of religious enthusiasm.
It's good to know that Bill and Tom have a higher authority, but it's still important to remain humble and true to what you believe in.  It's like when it comes to someone like Tom, it's important to remains humble andtrue to your values and what you think is good for you.
Yes, lol Thomas Jefferson was the editor of the bible but his wife was the one who created her own version of the Bible, so he created his own version for his wife.
I am thinking about the women he owned and all the women who were editing him.  He spent so much time with the bible that he probably spent too much time doing that.
Nice! I agree with you. I find myself jesting about the lack of editing in the Bible. I am not sure I agree though. I was jesting with my wife, but I find it sad to think of Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams not using the Bible at their inaugurations.
Yes, the parallel between Ted and John was that the Bible can be used to set an example and the Bible has an agenda, but the two of them were very different.
That's what I'm thinking. I think I find all three works as complementary to the canonical Bible. I wonder what they would have done with the Apocrypha, though.
I think it is good that they are not shunned.  The word is broad and varied so it is not the complete truth, but there are places where it is hidden and is not seen as such, but it is still a complete truth.
It is interesting how we find out what is glass dimly.  One such fact is that archeologists at a site in modern day Iraq find consistent texts of biblical texts from a very old time from around a different time and a different day.  They say that the tower of babel was based on a real building in the site based on consistent texts from that time.  I wonder if it was a tower of Babel or something else?
That's an interesting connection.  I wonder if people recognize that in texts from now on.  Maybe that is why more people recognize it.
Likewise, the documented historic performance of tom brady in the NFL helps people to recognize that his long, record-setting career as well. I wonder if his writings are in the same way, likewise?
Fame and notoriety do not always help with the spread of the human condition.  He has valuable insight about the human Condition, but not enough fame and notoriety for him to be able to spread it.
Brady doesn't need to sell books - he'll sell books, and he doesn't have to be strapped for cash.  An average engineer will earn more over the course of a career than the average NFL player and the average engineer.  Brady is the exceptions, but the average nfl player is the exception.
Yes, Brady is an exception but I think engineers envy him.  Thanks for the chat, I think I will go now.  Have a good night!
Good night and let the ball always roll!
Are you a Tom Brady fan of the Patriots? He plays for them?
Not really. I respect his talent though.
Yeah apparently his work ethic is off the charts. He even went so far to claim that football was his religion.
I heard that.  I think a lot of fans follow his example and Bill We Trust is one of them.  Do a lotOf fans follow him?
Brady was kind of a messiah figure.  But I think he was just plain old talent and sportsmanship.  I mean, to quote him, "If you think it can't happen, don't happen!"  I don't think he's anywhere close to being a "messiah figure."  He's got a close second for "plain old talent" and "blasphemy"...
You dont hear much about the Messiah in the news now, I think people idolize him.  He does toe the line in terms of his behavior, but I think that is because he is trying to toe the Line in terms to not be negative or something like that.  People see him as the Messiah and that is what they want to see, not who he really is.
Hey, in the 60's top bowlers in the US made twice as much as top NFL players.  I wonder what the top bowler did?
That is crazy, they must have been overpaid at the time and now they are overpaid,
Personally I think sports players should be paid less, I think they should be taxed to pay for healthcare. They get paid too much money and should be more taxed to Pay for healthcare
I agree, especially considering there is only 11 minutes of live game play each week!
That's crazy! ESPN won an Emmy award for it though.
I didn't know that either. I always thought it was the yellow line that the judge used to judge if a first down was first down, but I didn't think it would win an Emmy.
The line made life so much easier for them. The patriots have a qb that never fumbled the ball in his entire career.
The Patriots have been such huge successes.  I think they have been responsible for so many recently.
I wonder what the score was in a college game once, in 1916 the scoreWas 220-0. That is the most score in a game ever.
I heard it was between Georgia Tech and Cumberland.
Wow that's crazy, I can't imagine even sitting through that game, playing or not playing! I didn't know the NFL has no rule against women in the game. Can you imagine even Sitting in on the game?
Yeah, I think they are allowed, as long as they meet the eligibility requirements and the NFL, and if they meet that, then they are allow.  I dont know how long a lineman has to play in the NFL though.  If they crushed a QB, then yeah, they would never be allowed.
Me either, maybe they should create a league just like the WNBA, or create aleague of just QB's.
Yes it would be interesting to watch.  I hope the NFL would be more willing to treat them better.  The first female did make it to cheerleaders.  They did well.
I know right, male cheerleaders in the NFL don't even get to wear anything but their own clothes!
I think they should, the NFL has a male squad and it would be great to have a male team in the US, it would help the NFL out.  It was nice chatting with you, have a good day!
Hi there, do you like the New England Patriots and Tom Brady?
Hello, yes I do.  I like Tom Brady and have read a little of his method, I heard that he has a best selling book called "The Tom Brady Method."
I have heard of it. I think it is an inspiration for some people and a devotion to the Patriots. I can't see how that would overshadow other kinds of faith though. beneke worries that the devotion to The Patriots might overshadow other faiths. Brady's coach says that Brady's Coach is a inspiration.
No I didn't know that.  I know there are many fans who like the Patriots.
Yes, in New England people are devoted to watching the Patriots and talking about the team on all Sundays.  Even on church Sundays.
Wow, they chatter about it nonstop for an entire Sunday!  If I had to devote an entire sunday to watching the games, it would be eleven minutes of live gameplay and the chatter.  Oh wow.  I can't even keep up with eleven minutes!
I don't.  I have never heard of the Patriots as a team on Sundays.  They are always a focus on faith in God.  What about you?  Do you have a team that is a focus and a focus in God?
That's good. I wonder if people wished that reading the bible was part of the education curriculum like prior to 1963.
I'm not sure.  But, I'm sure there's a number of players like Matthew Slater of the Patriots who have been featured in the number of spiritual/evangelism/spiritual/football evangelism.  He is one of many off-field players who have featured on the national TV news on Super Bowl Sunday, which is also Football Sunday.  Do you know the name of the Super Bowl Saturday?
I wonder how many people tuned in compared to the Bible... A whopping 4 billion copies of the Bible have been sold and only 7.5 billion copies have been the Bible.  I wonder how it sold that many.
I think the printing was done by the pastor of Richmond Community Church in Glen Allen, VA, and the pastor is a Patriots fan, so there's some lessons in Brady's lessons from the $5 billion copy estimate.  He was a Patriots Fan in the beginning and then became the pastor at that church, which is now the congregation of the Richmond Community church.  Maybe there's lessons in Belichick's lessons, too.
Yeah five billion copies is a lot, I think that is a different type of faith lessons, I wonder if there are any faith lessons in there, I would think so.
I do not know, but I know that Brady's commitment to his craft allowed him to overcome the odds. Brady's career began with a sixth-round draft pick, behind arguably the best QB ever, Daniel "D.C." Daniel. He was arguably the only QB to ever be a sixth-, seventh, and eighth-round pick.
Tom vs. Time is another story that could be worth a read, I think there is a documentary about that, Tom vs. time, I am not sure how they depict it but it is worth a look, it is quite a story, its worth a reads, the documentary is about the story
No,I have not seen it yet, but no,I think the main focus of it is Brady coming out of nowhere to be on top and then at the bottom, but he has shown the ability to rebound from adversity quite nicely.
Yeah my friend is a really nice guy.  He changed his perspective on what football is all about.  I told him that he's a hard-working QB and puts the best out there for his team.  And he's told his fans that he thinks football games are a fun way to spend time with the kids and he is told that ESPN won an Emmy and he said that ESPN is the team that has changed his Perspective on football.  Seems like a nice guy to me.  ESPN won a Emmy for their football games?  I wonder if that means they are hard- working?
I don't know but I would like to see that happen.  I remember last year when they did it in the Super Bowl, the patriots came back to win the game in overtime, that was spectacular.  Things seem to just happen.
Yes, that was a great game, I would have preferred that over sitting in the same seat the entire time. This year's game would preferred the boring game, sitting in your seat for the entire game, but still on the edge of your seat the whole way.  I think some people who had bets on that game would have been disappointed, this year's GAME was on the same edge, I think people who placed bets on the game would prefer the boring one.
True, save the blood pressure, that was the method. Brady is totally committed to his method and is sincere in his sincere belief that it is a great way to get the most out of your game so that is true.
Yeah, I think it is a message well said.  Do you know what TB stands for?
Yes, I know that the title shows that they are talking about a number of areas. The list of attributes is in addition to their spiritual beliefs, and the methods they are using. The 12 attributes are: good nutrition, fitness, fitness methods, spiritual beliefs and lifestyle.  In addition to these attributes, they say that they maintain a good lifestyle.
Are you a fan of Tom Brady?
I am a fan, but not sure I would call myself a fan.  I do respect him.  He has been in the league as long as anyone.  One of the greats and still in great health.
I agree, I watched his documentary Tom vs Time, and now am a big fan after watching it, he is one of the best, it really shows how much work he puts into his craft, and I agree, Im a big user of the TV, I'm a big Fan after watching his documentary, he truly knows his craft
I never heard of him before I watched that documentary and never heard the name before I heard of that documentary.  I like watching the Patriots when Benjarvus Green-Ellis played for them.  He was a solid running back that never fumbled the football in his NFL career.  A running back who never fumbles the football once in his nfl career.
That is incredible! They have put tracking chips in the footballs to track the data such as velocity and such.
No, I didn't know that.  I heard that they have tracking chips embedded in the players shoulder pads to record their every move, even throwing from the stands.  Did you know players get fined if they do not use the chips when throwing and they use the tracking chips in the Players shoulder pads  to record?
That's crazy how far they've come technology wise. I can't believe the average NFL game only had 11 minutes of actual gameplay in 2001. It was crazy that the gameplay was longer.
That's so short. 11 minutes of crap! I'd be playing for 3 hours if it wasn't for 11 minutes! They should make gameplay last longer. They should also allow women to play too. I wonder what the rules are for women toplay.
I agree, I can't believe the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average Lifetime earnings of the average NFL and MLB players.  That's surprising to me.
That's pretty surprising, but I guess that's because the average football player only plays for a few years, engineers work for a lot longer, and the average Football player only does 2 or 3 years.
True. When I hear football I always get confused when I hear people use the word and think we should call soccer that.
It has a lot of the same ring to it, but it feels weird to use gridiron football, it has a nice ring toIt, but still feels weird
It does. In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that era. Things have changed.
Yeah, that is weird.  I know Iowa's visiting locker room is completely painted pink at times.  That backfired on them a few times.
lol  That is to support breast cancer awareness.
I think that is a good excuse. I heard that ESPN won an Emmy well won for the creation of the yellow first down line.
That is interesting.  I didn't know that.  Do you like football games?  The highest score in a football game ever was when Georgia tech beat cumberland 222-0 in 1916.
That's crazy. I wonder when Georgia Tech learned the triple option? Do you know the effectiveness of it?
I'm not sure.  Do you know how many teams are in the NFL?  There are 32 teams now.
I think there are 32, but I'm not sure how many of them are in the US.
Nice chatting with you today.
Nice chatting with you too! Have a great day!
Do you watch the NFL?
Hi I do! I enjoyed the Superbowl, watching Brady and company winn their sixth NFL champioship!
Brady has written a book now!
Yes I did, it is about his method of doing it.
Yes!  Tom vs Time,  its a lifestyle brand,  and they have a documentary in the works,  Tom Vs Time, a documentary about the lifestyle brand.
yeah it will be a facebook series
Yes, it is.  Here is a fun fact, do you have a favorite ice cream flavour?
I can't imagine it is, is he kind of vegan?
Yes it's a vegan and the flavor is avocado and its pretty healthy.
Nice! I understand that he is sort of on a spiritual quest, sort of like a craft, he dedicates himself to his craft, I think he's on a Spiritual Quest?
Did you know women can play in the NFL?
Yeah, I guess there is no rule against that, they just have to meet eligibility requirements.
I guess, I didn't know that.  Did you ever hear about the tracking chips that the players use all the time, I guess it helps them on the field.  I wonder if they use them all the times.
No, I never knew they track players like that.  I knew theytrack he balls though but not the players
Yes they are tracking stuff like velocity and rotation and also using shoulder pads.
Yes, that is a lot of expense, especially when the average playtime is only 11 minutes per game, a lot less than in the 1960s!
Yeah I know right.  On a different topic do you like the Bible?
I do not know much. I know the New Testament, apocrypha, and the apocryphal. What about you? How much knowledge do you have.
I know some of the facts like that.  It was one of the most influential books in history and sold over 4 billion copies and it was one the most popular books in History and sold almost 5 billion copies.
I know it used to be common for school children to read from the Bible, but these days it seems lawsuits have curbed that, and now it is not common for children to reading from the bible.
Yes that is true.  Jefferson created his own version of the Bible.
Good morning! How are you?
Good morning.  Are you a football fan?  If so, are you a fan of the football team?
Yeah, I do like it. How about you? I read that the NFL has no rule agains female players, how bout you?
I am interested in it.  My husband and son are not interested.  I watch the superbowl with them at the house.  They are not going to watch it, but it's still reasonable.  But I do have to admit I would like to see more colleges have female kickers.  There are many in the US that are interested.
I watch every Sunday.  My wife roots for the Patriots.  I am a Steelers fan.  Lol.  She is a kicker and a punter so we watch every sunday.  The Patriots had the first pick in the NFL draft for a female kicker but they didn't pick one.  They went with a punters position.  There are not enough positions.
I liked the steelers in college, but my husband was always into the patriots.  I saw a documentary about Tom Brady that was a documentary that combines football and religion.  That was very interesting.
I dont really like them to be honest, I dont think that mix will ever mix well.  Especially since it takes place on Sunday!
LOL, I laughed out loud!  I heard that some columnist for the Boston Globe called it a cult.  He is planning a new "Boston Globe" when he retires.  They are kind of like a ministry combined with a nutrition and exercise.  It is some kind of ministry combined.  I wonder if they are going to be like a cult?  lol
I think theimportaance of staying physically fit is the popularity, but mixed with religion and the importaance for him to make some extra money is the importAance of stay physically fit. I dont think it should be mixed with Religion, but who knows.
I don't see NFL players as making lots of money because of their short careers, and I'm not sure if you can engineer it, but the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is much higher than the average for an NFL or MLB player.  I would think NFL players are making more, but I don't know if you consider NFL players to be players as Making lots of $$$ or MLB players asMaking more than an engineer, since the average Lifetime earnings are much less.
Yeah but thoe number is probably because the players dont last that long and the average player doesn't make that much. An engineer would make a lot more money than an average player. The average engineer makes over 8 milion dollars while the average football player only makes about 30000 dollars over his lifetime. That is a lot of money but the average engineering career only lasts about 6 years so the players really don't last long.
I'll take being an engineer any day.  It is weird that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes on the field in a lifetime.  That's short for a play, but it is also short for the lifetime of someone who has been through so much trauma, like the high rates of TCE (tachycephalus) in a game.  The average NFL player has a lifetime of high rates, even for only a few minutes of play.
I did hear that, I wonder if thos 11 minutes are exciting? I don't think the 11 minutes  are exciting enough to last.
Yeah, they are.  A football player or an engineer would make half a million dollars at their respective jobs after only 2 years of college, not too shabby.  But a football player and an engineer could make half an million dollars in two years at theirrespective jobs.
True, there are some greats in football, but engineers too, that will be rememberd forever.
I guess so, people will just remember you forever! I never played football but I used to watch when my parents had me watch it when I lived in England when they lived in another country. I was surprised to learn that gridiron football was only played in the US for about 20 years before they became the first country to have gridiron baseball and gridiron Football. I guess the rest of the world was surprised too to learn it was not gridiron.
Yeah the rest of the world takes soccer seriously but we only call it football because we call it soccer here.
That is true, but the word "football" is used in places like australia for "football", but in rugby, it is rugby.
I dont really know anything about rugby, but I know american football is very similiar to it.
Yeah, my kid school had a team that used to play when he was in kid school.
Do you know what a nobleman once said to the dinner of his life is when he had dinner with the lord?
Wow, random... well nice talking with you.
I think things like that are an accident, lol.  Have a good one!
Hi! Do you have knowledge of how Tom Brady eats, exercises and rests?
No not really, I imagine he has a pretty intense regimen, do you?
I know he will continue to play a long time, there is a special that claims that football is his religion, he lives every day for it. I wonder if he can continue to playing for a longtime.
i heard that he wrote a book called the "method" and that he did not expect to last for 10 more years but he did. He wrote a books, so I wonder when he'll retire and what method he uses.
Yes, I have.  I think it's a series on a healthy eating lifestyle by him and his wife.  Deepak Chopra says it's about whether you lean negative, positive or negative, or lean positive.  Do you feel positive or positive about that?
I don't know about him, but he is a football fan, so I don't think he is cheating. Are you a football Fan?
Yes, I follow college football. I like Oklahoma and follow that team because I love the yellow line that ESPN invented to show the first down line. I think that's a gain for the OU team, they are the best.
I heard they won a emmy for that line. I can't imagine watching a game without that line, but I heard they've won an Emmy for it.
I don't think I would be able to anymore, but football is used a lot more globally, so much so that some games are considered to be "global" football
True, I think you're referring to American football.  In any case, did you know that highest score in a football game was 222-0.  That's the highest score ever in a game.
I think it was 77-0, Oklahoma beat Texas.  I think it's the varsity team by 74-0.  The JV team was beaten by the JVTeam by 74
Wow!  Those were both extremely high scoring games.  222-0 is the highest ever.  That was also in 1916.
I can only imagine. I heard that they would stop the clock in the second half to shorten the game. I wonder if it was like those games I mentioned and not the Iowa visitor's dressing room painted pink.
I wonder what it supposed to be? Some kind of psychological game?
It is, but there are studies that prove that weight lifters cannot lift as much in the pink room. They move to win games and the pinkroom is their move to do that.
Wow, I never heard of that, interesting!  Do you remember the Patriots RB BenJarvus Green-Ellis?
I do not.  He was distinctive though.
He never fumbled a football his entire career and he's the only QB who has ever fumbled
I know right, what a distinction! It is amazing that he was able to do this, the NFL has 32 teams and I don't know any other teams with that distinction.
I agree!  In the 1960's top bowlers made more than the top football players.
Bowlers did a great job of marketing to increase their incomes. Now, most people don't know that.  The NFL does a greatjob of marketing.  Top team teams make more than the players, but top players.  I think that the NFL will do a better job of marketing the players and the bowlers, too.  Nice chat!
do you like Tom Brady?
Not really.  How about you?
He has a book out called "The Athlete's Bible". He's getting spiritually involved, but he has been making comments that he is not spiritually involved.
I think it is difficult to equate spirituality with football. It's the opposite.
Brady is a kind of deity to most fans, a messiah and coach Belichick, a Messiah and coach.  In Bill we trust, and in Brady we go.
People are so into their fans it's amazing. Brady sold avocado ice cream in 2007.  He sell a new flavor every year and has the same face on front of all the people.  They say Brady soldocado ice cream for $5 and he sold out.
That does sound good, I wonder if he has a cult-like following.  I know that Bob Ryan is a columnist for the New York Times, and he is known for being a cult like figure, but not as cult- like as he is in the UK.
I think it is, in which the celebrities are the only thing that can behave. it makes they experts. I think it's good in this case football. it helps celebrities be who they are and behave.
I agree, that can be annoying.  In college football, my alma mater ran up the score on Cumberland 222-0.  I am not terribly proud of that.
I'm sure if I were playing, I would have turned in the bible if I was on the losing side.
Or maybe cumberland could have used the pink locker room that they have at Iowa.
Probably because they were respectful of the other team. Those were silly games back then.
Maybe. Did you know the NFL has no written rule that women could not play in it? I wonder why.
I did not know that, but that's probably for the best part. I hear a woman can be good but I think the guys get worked up too much.
I agree.  It's not a big deal to me,  I just don't see why it's a big issue.  Another interesting football fact is that the average NFL game only has 11 actual minutes of gameplay.  That's only about 7 actual minutes!
I enjoyed watching football for years, and the main reason I liked it was because it was only 11 minutes of play. Now that we have hours, it's just not time to sit in front of the TV for 11 minutes. It's too much time to sitting.
I like documentaries, like finding the tower of Babel in Iraq.
I was thinking that it was a really tall building.  I have a mental image of it as a lot smaller than what I am thinking.  It must have been a lot less than that, and if it existed it would have been quite a tall building, but a lot bigger than the mental image.
I think its a bunch of rubble due to recent bombings.  It's interesting that Thomas Jefferson cut the first bibel that referred to miracles and the supernatural.
I heard about that.  Funny thing is theres a copy of that shredded book,  love how it looked like a shredded book.  I wonder how they got the copy,  funny thing is it was only $3.
Yeah, I hear you, I wonder what his reasoning was?  Thanks for the chat, you were excellent and I will hear from you again.
It's hard to believe the Patriots just won the Super Bowl. Tom Brady is so good in his age.
Good morning!  I love Tom Brady. I didn't realize that he was so spiritual.  I always though he was like the energizer bunny or something.  lol.  But, I'm sure he is spiritual.
I did not know that either! I thought football was his religion, but he said he had a friend Gotham Chopra, who was a god.
I think he is pretty spiritual, I think he wants to find that deeper purpose, his own version of the spiritual episeode, his version of a spiritual episero.
I guess I will have to read Tom's book to see if I like that method.
I haven't. What is that?
Yeah, I have. I find it kind of gross. But there's some interesting stuff. I enjoy avocado ice cream. I don't enjoy avocadoIce cream, though. I just find it to be gross.
Ooh, that sounds so gross. Do you watch much football?
I watch a little every other weekends on the weekends, but I prefer the NFL to college football, which is the only other league I like to watch.
I was shocked to find out that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay, I was shocked that there was only 11 minutes in an average NFLgame.
That is surprising, but I guess that's the way teams are setting up, calling the plays. They play a lot of time running around and work out so they earn a lot more money, and earn a a lotOf money if they play a whole time.
That is so true!  I read somewhere that in the 1960s, top bowlers in the US made twice as much as the top football stars!  They must have made more than the top bowlERS.
It shows how quickly things can change.  I mean even though pro football players have really long careers, they only make compared to other professions over the course of a lifetime, so I wonder how much they make compared with what pro football player make now.
I read that average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average NFL player.
That's pretty interesting. Are you religious at all? I read the Bible, but I'm not religious. Do you read it?
I read it every night before bed. It was a habit my grandma taught us when I was a kid and now I still read it.
I read it occasionally.  Things change.  In the UK it used to be pretty common for students to be required to read.  Not so much now.  Now it's not even common for them to berequired to read it.
it really does.  If only America would do that back then.  alot of things would def be different.  Practice, practice, practice.
Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the bible, his own Version of the Bible.
Yeah, I heard he took a razor and cut out the parts he considered to be supernatural.  He also had a razor to his razor and Cut out the "supernatural" parts.
That was an interesting change to make. It was a pleasure talking to you. Have a great day.
Hello, do you enjoy sports?
I do like sports, what about you?
I do, I only have a passing knowledge of football, and you?
I am passing too. I am not an expert or anything, but I know a lot in football.
I am not an expert but I do have a basic understanding.
Good, well Football is a popular game, it has many peoples names, it is a very popular game
It is surprising to me that people invest so much into a game that has only 11 minutes of real action in it, when there are a dozen or so minutes of Real action in a game.
It is exciting because there is action, but violence, violence, and death is what is exciting about it.  Outcomes are wagered, much like men in combat.  Death, violence and violence.
That's true, but the average lifetime earnings for engineers is actually better paid than players.  I believe that's based on the average Lifetime earnings, but engineers have to think about retirement, because due to injuries that force early retirement, engineers are often better paid.
Engineers are the smart people. they earn the money to last life. they have to be.
Yes.  In the mid 90's they were actually paid less paid than bowlers and more paid than football players.
Bowlers were definitely paid better, but they took job risks.
I think so too!  I wish they would get more though.
Good to know.  Isn't the Bible an important part of the football game?  Is the Bible the Bible's an importantPart of the game?
It is, I think you are referring to an actual Bible, not the book released by Brady, or a book releasedBy Brady.
Yes, that is in his bedroom
Yes, I know!  The player's performance is the most important factor in a players performance.  Mental fortitude, religion, etc.  It is the important factor.
I understand, I think the strength comes from inside you, and life, and strength in the way you think and see.
I can physically read, but mentally, not so much.  The difference in being able to read can make all the difference.
That is true, football must start inside, the preparation is all that make up for the world, and the preparation for the football must Start inside. Thanks for chatting, have a good night and thanks for being true.
you as well! thank you very much!
hi, do you watch the NFL?
I sure do, do you like Tom Brady?
I think he's a pretty decent player, he has a new QB Benjarvus on the Patriots.
Yes he is a decent QB.  With 6 super bowl rings Brady is the only QB with more.
Yeah that is true.  Benjarvus is the only guy in NFL that has never fumbled a ball with his hand and he is the best guy in nfl.
He did? that is impressive, I wonder how many games he played in, I know how many more games he's played
About 200 games in his entire career
That is impressive. The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live play time.
Yeah, we are glued to the tv for hours to watch a single game, so yeah, I believe it.
That's the amazing part, the action is so interesting.  Baseball is just interesting, I cant complain about that.
Yeah, I hear they are placing tracking ships on the players now.
Yes I was reading about that. I wonder if the game will be different, practice, or game.
I bet they do, they track lots of stats like velocity and rotation and other averages.
We live in amazing times, the running back is going to tire out before the game is over, we have a running back that is going too old to be a runningback.
Yeah, and women can play in the NFL too.
Yes I did read about that,  a couple of them actually, I think that is a good idea.
I guess time will tell. I'm curious to see if they ever happen. I know that New Orleans cheerleaders have a weird rule about that. I guess time and change will come.
No, I have not heard about that. What is that?
They are not allowed to eat at the same restaurant as the players, and they can not be in the same room as the player if the players are in the restaurant as well.
No kidding?  I guess that is not too close to what I would do I guess.
The worst is when the players walk in the restaurant mid meal and have to leave the restaurant.
I know right! I wonder why they are carrying on like that?
I think it is fair.  I hope they can get rid of it soon.
Are you a fan of Tom Brady?
I'm not a huge fan, but I do like the fact that he follows the "Athlete's Bible" method and seems to be in the top shape, do you follow it?
I've heard of him and looked him up, but never looked him in a documentary, I'm watching a "Tom vs. Time" documentary right now. I'm a fan of the game but not a fan for the documentary.
No I have not seen it, but I have seen a little bit.  I love what Brady has done with his life.  In fact I saw an episode where he said that if he could compete with anyone, he would give up his life.. I am sure that I would do the same, I love the fact that I am giving up mine.  It is very powerful, I am not as powerful, but still, I would love to compete with him.
I have total respect for him and the work he puts into it. I like to facebook watch him in the offseason and on my Facebook watch all the work I can to see the work.
I wonder what NFL off-seasons are like. It flies by with the regular season only being about 11 weeks from September to December. That's so much less than the 16 weeks of the regular Season.
It is, I think that they should lengthen the season, at least a month.  I think the 16 weeks are too much for the teams, but 20 weeks for each teams.
Agreed! Surprisingly, though, games are so short. The average game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
That is crazy.  Do you know what the highest football score is?
Wow! It was a game between Georgia Tech and Cumberland back in 1916. Georgia Tech actually won 222-0! Imagine that!
That score would be something to see lol I wish I could play for Georgia Tech!  In the 60s, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.  Times have changed, in the 60's top bowler made twice what top football players make now.
True.  But, the average lifetime earnings of the MLB and NFL players are much better today than they were in the 1960s.  Engineers make more than bowlers back then and engineers today.  They made more as pro than bowler, but the average Lifetime earnings of MLB and NFC players are way better.
LOL good question!  Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his career, impressive!
He must have so much talent and skill.  I wonder how he got to play.  Did you know that the University of Iowa's pink locker room is painted pink.  That must feel insulting to the visiting football team if you ask me.  It must feel like a little bit of a play on the name painted on the locker room.
lol.  I think it is to support breast cancer awareness.  That is very nice of them.
I hope it did.  On a similar note, women can play in the NFL as long as they meet the eligibility requirements.  Women are not forbidden from playing in theNFL but they are forbidden from being signed by the teams.  There have been no female players signed by any teams yet.
I'm not sure.  I've seen a bit of football science in the last few years, like they use tracking chips inside the footballs to track velocity, rotation, rotation of the ball, etc.  etc.
Agreed. They place chips in the shoulder pads and the shoulder blades and also in high tec (high Tec) record every move of the player and the place chips into the shoulder bags.
That is crazy! Do you ever watch the Super Bowl? It is held on the first Sunday in February and it is crazy that it is held in February!
I missed it sadly.  I was reading the Bible that day.  Speaking of which, did you know that it is considered one of the most influential books of all time and has sold over 4 billion copies!  It's also considered one the best selling and most influential book of all.
I know, I read it a few times a week. Nice chatting with you today.
Evidently there are some weird things Tom Brady will do with avocado ice cream.
lol, dunno.  That doesn't sound too appealing to me.  But yeah,  I knew that after reading that.  I'd give him a spoonful now and then.  Give him a few spoonfuls of it and I'll be done.  lol.  Tom Brady an interesting character.  He is a Texas football guy from a different religion.  Read that reading about him,  he is a character from another state.  What's up with Texas?  It's not like they don't like football in Texas.
That is so weird, I would give it a try, maybe give it try and see how it goes.  I just read that he has a copy of Thomas Jefferson's bible.  That is so interesting!
Hehe! "Thats the bible! Thou shalt not fumble with it like in football...or fumble with the bible..Dunno...
I wonder if there's anything about proper inflation. surely someone checked those trackers in the footballs.
Yeah I have heard about that.. they track everything.  I guess they also compile and put in the players' shoulder pads and movements so they can track where they are going fast and stufff and get more accurate play stats.  But I wonder how they get accurate play Stats.
Did you know cheerleaders can't go to the same restaurant as the other cheerleaders?
Im hoping they do, Imho, I hope not. A bit creepy, imho.
I think a cheerleader should be able to go to the same restaurant with the players if they are in a restaurant, but not as much as a cheerleaders.
I have no idea.  It's probably just to psyche them out.  Hey did you know the visitors locker room at U of Iowa is painted pink?  I wonder if that's so the other team can see what's going on.  Maybe that's why the visitors' locker room is painted Pink?  Maybe they're trying to psyche out the otherTeam?
That worked decades ago, but I'm not sure if players care.  A pink locker room would be soothing.  I find that the players would have benefited from that in those days.  Cumberland once lost 222-0 to U of Iowa, and I find it even more soothing that they lost.  That was in 1916!  I wonder if the pink locker rooms would have been better for Cumberland if they'd used them in 1916?
Dunno, but that pink room? Wow! That makes you wonder if it was just a little experiment that went on years ago. They did an experiment and found that weightlifters can lose up to 20 pounds in twenty seconds and that the effect of the loss is worn on their minds. That is, if people can do that, what would the weight loss effect be like in real life? I think people would think twice about doing that twenty years ago, but maybe it changes their minds, who knows.
I know right!  Did you know bowlers used to be made more than football players in the 1960s, scores were almost even, but bowlers only got about 5% as many scores
Maybe a woman could become a football player in the NFL, as long as they meet the physical requirements of the rules of the NFL.  I wonder if a woman would be able to meet thePhysical requirements of a football?
I think they have a chance.  Some highschools have female kickers, so as long as the eligibility requirements are met they have the chance.
Dunno.  I know if my daughter were playing football, I'd constantly worry about her getting tackled.  Yeah I would be worried about that too.  Especially if mydaughter were playing.  She would constantly worry she would get tackled.
In my county, there's no co-ed teams, so the girls have to be tougher on the field than the boys. I think the saints have a cheerleader for the boys, but I don't know if mine was ever a cheerleaders...maybe in a different county.
I dont mind them doing that.  Its a different country though,  i dont mind it.
It's a county in the US, where I live.
lol, I misread your last name, I think you're in a county!  weird, lol.  Interesting that you know the name of every county, huh?  How interesting!  I like games, but they are so long they take so much time for them.  They spend a lot of time on each position and stuff.  There is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in a game.  That is way too long for only 11 seconds of gameplay.  I think there is actually more than that.  Only about 11 minutes or so of actual play and only 11 to 15 minutes of actually gameplay.
That's not as weird as ESPN winning an Emmy for superimposing a yellow line on tv!
Yeah, I remember back when they did chalk up the lines and Joe Montana doing commentary on them. I remember he was doing the lines for the first few lines and joe montana doing commentary. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just read that there is a white line that runs along the line where the RB passes the ball.  Hehe.
It sounds bizarre, but I think the term "gridiron" is a better term for the football than the gridiron.
No, I'll have to Google it.  It's not gridiron.  I think it just means something to make it sound tough.
lol, I honestly could care less, I would make more money being an engineer, lol.  I would go for the baller anyday.  Make more money, and I honestly couldn't care less.
Yeah, and that doesn't include all the sweet endorsement deals that they get.  They get so much money!  I wonder what they do with all that money!
I'm not sure. Thanks for chatting with me, have a wonderful night!
Hey, have a good one!
You too!  Thanks!
Hasn't the weather been kind of crazy here?  Stay safe in the areas you are in!
Thankfully we don't have any flooding right now.
Hi, do you watch the NFL?
I do, NFL is the thing, the National Football League, right?
Yeah the NFL, it has 32 teams, right?
I thought there would be more than a dozen. I was wrong, I thought it would be like a dozen or more huh? I guess they went bankrupt during the great recession, so I was probably wrong.
There are 30 teams, right?
They were planning on eliminating a couple more, but that seems a bit excessive. I don't think that's fair to the people who have things they do on Sunday, or to the things they are planning on eliminate a couple of.
Yes they are doing other things I guess. Do you watch much football by the way? I wonder what the highest score ever was in football for the highest scored
I guess there is a limit to everything, right? What is the highest possible score in football? I guess if you look at the scoreboard, there is no limit to what it can be.
Maybe the highest one recorded was 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat the Cumberland.
Georgia Teck? that was a great score, that school just quit football because of the score on the scoreboard, what despair! I am very proud of Georgia Teck, but not proud of the school's despair, that is a greatscore!
I think that is possible. I didn't watch ESPN all day that day, so I don't know. Do you watch ESPN?
Yes, I do.  I like it.  They have a Spanish football channel.  Have you ever used it?
Yes, it is, it's American.  He won an award for it for creating the superimposed yellow line.
The award for discovering a yellow line was discovered from the ancient greakes.  Does color matter or does it matter?
It is visible because it is the only way to follow the game on the screen. The other ones blend into the background and are not visible.
I'm sure you're right.  ESPN discover that yellow is easier to see in the Spanish.  The yellowness is because oxygen is less than in Spanish. Did ESPN discover this?  I wonder if they got an award for that?
Nope, just the yellow line.  I wonder if women can play in the NFL, if they choose to.  Women can play for the NFL.
If they chose. I figure one day we will see women try those things. They will try it, and presto! A woman in a helmet. If a player wants to be a player, then he or she will try.
I think it makes the game more interesting!  Did you hear of that rule for New Orleans cheerleaders?
I did not. I thought they were cheered? I wonder if that's the only way that cheerleaders have rules.
Yes they have a pretty sad rule that they can't eat at the same restaurant as the football players. They can't even eat in the same Restaurant as the other football players
Hey how are you doing? Do you read the Bible? I know I alll but never read it myself.
I do not really. Do you?
I'm good.  I've read a little.  It's cool that Jefferson actually made his own version of the bible.
That is interesting.  Teddy Roosevelt and John Adams did not use the Bible for their swearing in ceremonies.  I wonder why.
That is weird.  I also didn't know that Jefferson didn't use it, I think because there were supernatural parts in it, or maybe because Jefferson didn not like the supernatural parts
No idea, I never knew that.
I did not know that. I always wanted to use the Bible in elementary schoo but they had a historical version. I wanted to see the verified facts so I didn't have to learn about the historical version, just the facts.
I did not. We did it at home. Do you like football?
I do like it.  I read about the "method" of Tom Brady and the book.  Have you read about that book?
I have not heard of it, is it good, I wonder if it is any good.  I didn't realize the average NFL live game play is only 11 minutes and I didn's realize the Average NFL live games is only 17 minutes
I haven't seen it yet but I think it has good reviews and it is really short, but it is crazy that a team scored 222-0 once, I wonder if that was in time haha that is so short, I can't believe that one team scored that many in that time haha
I know, it's not that long, but I can believe it!
Yeah I wonder if they have video games that do that?  I would like to watch football games with women players.
I would definitely check it out, I think it would be rough for women if they weren't allowed to play in the game. But for the sake of the game, I would definitely enjoy it for the game itself.
Yeah I think they should be allowed to, that would be so cool if they were that good and they were allowed to. The average NFL player makes only $6,700, I guess I make more as an engineer in my lifetime than an average NFL players, I Guess I make twice as much
Lol, yeah, the average lifetime earning is higher than the average NFL player's, but not as much as the average lifespan earning of the average nfl player.
Yup good for them haha. I wish the Saints could just treat their cheer leaders better though haha.
That's crazy, I mean I guess they had some kind of plan before hand to take them to the restaurant, and then just take them out to a restaurant, I guess to have some togetherness. lol
Yeah I know right, and yeah I think they do too, what do you think of the cheerleaders that painted the whole locker room pink as protest haha
Maybe, it was just a joke, I'm thinking those tracking chips are going to help them a lot. Anyway, good chat!
Thanks and I hope they help make up for the bowling skills of the football players back in the 60s and 70s.  I think they could make up some bowling skills.
Hello there, do you watch the NFL at all?
Hello there, I do, I'm a fan of Tom Brady, what about you?
Benjarvus is one of my favorite players.  I like the patriots.
I think I remember him, I think he had a career of his own, he never fumbled once in his career.
Yeah, he has some talent, I think. U of Iowa painted their visitor locker room pink.
I think it is to support breast cancer awareness, right?
I'm not sure, but it is possible. Do you watch the ESPN?
Yes, I do. They won an Emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line that represented the first down line in the first Down.
Yeah pretty cool, I wonder how they got that award.  Do you know the highest score in football history in a game was 222 to 0, that was the highestScore in football History.
No, I don't, what is it?
It was Cumberland against Georgia Tech who scored 222 to 0.
Holy smokes, that was a long game for Cumberland, I bet!  In the 60s, bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.
Times have changed so much in our lifetime.  I can't believe that engineers still make more than them!
yes, longer careers, and more teams in the NFL, so many teams now
Yeah, yup, that might be why.  Also, it might explain why they play for only 11 weeks, that is it.
That is crazy, especially when you consider that there is only an average of 11 minutes of actual gameplay in a game and that is only 11 minutes!
That is so short!  That is crazy and also crazy that now women can play!
Yes, there is no written rule against female players. They also use tracking chips inside the footballs to collect data like velocity, rotation, and rotation of the football.
Yeah, I hope they use that data to help make the game safer and reduce the number of concussions.
I agree. The Bible is the highest selling book of all time with 4 billion copies sold and the highest sold book of the Bible is 5 billion copies!
Wow, that is a lot of books. I'm not surprised but a lotof people must like it, that's why it is.
Sports can bring people together, opinions and religion, I think.
I think it can, it is a source of some common ground.
Yes, it's interesting how some people see sports as religion. the similarities of rules and rituals.
I think it's because people are so dedicated to the sport that it is like a religion to some people and it's very successful.
Yes, but Patriot fans are not Catholicism's foot ball.  I know that Tom Brady has changed football and even ESPN, which is managed to win an emmy for the superimposed superimposed Tom Brady on a catholicism foot ball, managed to get an emry for "Joeoke."  Patriot fans really like Tom Brady, though.
I think the Patriots are the lannisters of football.
Funny comparison, the lannisters of the NFL and the cheerleaders of the Saints! The NFL has some strict rules for its cheer leaders. The Saints cheerleaders arent even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players! They can't eat with the players either!
That seems backwards and out of date today.
Yeah, I guess not. I wonder if they chip the players on the field to track time. I would think that would be wild to see.
I wonder how they chip the football.
I wonder why that is considered to be something that has changed sports.  Technology is used in many countries in a different way.
I wonder too, but I think cameras are used to slow down images to allow more accurate judgement on sports, so it helps with accurate judgement.
That's hilarious, I wonder what they would do with a foot ball game though. There is only 11 minutes of actual game play in a foot football game, I think!
I admit it is 11 minutes, but a lot of action packed, there are a dozen or so dozen of them. It's not a lot, but it's still a lot.
Yeah absolutely. Are you interested in presidents? Teddy Roosevelt was pretty gnarly.
I am, he was!
John quincy adams, during the swear in ceremony, survived an assassination attempt and was given prezzys of a bible and a Bible as a thank you.  I guess that is the ultimate in separation of church and state, and how one survived an Assassination Attempt.  Do you think that the separation of the church and the state is over?
I wonder why he did that?
Well, I like Abe Lincoln a lot and controversially I like LBJ.  Do you know who the other presidents were?
JFK, Roosevelt, and Washington.  I like Washington the best.
Idk about Roosevelt,  but Washington and JFK are considered the three wealthiest presidents,  I believe Washington and jfk are considered to be.
Washington was the only person in history to unite both parities.
Wasnt he?  He also wasnt a part of the two party system?
It would be like the two party system where you argue over critical issues for the sake of arguing, for the whole sake ofArguing.
Well it's been nice chatting! Have a great night!
Hi friend, do you watch the NFL?
Hey, I'm a big fan! I do like the NFL, what about you?
I love watching the NFL. Tom Brady has a book called the athletes bible. I wonder if it was religion?
Tom Brady is my favorite player, I have seen him since I was in school, he graduated while in high school.
That's awesome. I went to the same school as him. What school was he in?
University of Michigan. Who is your favorite NFL team?
Heck, I like the vikings, I think it's because they are blue, but you?
I am a big fan of the Giants, but the Blue Baby is doing terrible so I am not a big Fan.  I like ann arbor but the Giants have been terrible since she took over as the GM
I have not but have wanted to catch a game there before. Did you know that ESPN won an emmy for it?
No I didn't, but I am surprised.  I like ESPN, I am pretty religious, and ESPN is really great and I am not surprised.
I am not religious at all. I live by Tom Brady's bible lol. How about you?
Haha, me too. Have you ever been to an NFL game?
No, not really.  I have been to college football games though.  My favorite college football team is the Iowa Hawkeyes.  They painted the visitor's locker room pink.  That was my dream.
Yeah I heard that, I think that would mess with the psyche of the other team and mess with your psyche, Iowa is a great school.  I like going to NFL games too. There are only 11 minutes of gameplay in an NFL game.
I did not know that. It's so small considering the game lasts for 3 hours and that time is only for one game
I have not but I'd like to one day. Did you know women can technically play in the nfl?
Interesting.  I wonder who else is in the leagues that they play in?  I know there are several leagues.
Yeah, I'm not sure. It is interesting though. I played football in school.
I played all sports, baseball in college, and you?
Wow that is impressive! I played tennis and baseball for a few years myself, but never tennis!
Nice.  It's been good chatting!  I have to run.  Good chatting with you.
Same here, have a good one
Hi there, are you a fan of the NFL?
The NFL? The National Football League?
Yes, do you have a favorite team or player?
I don't have a favorite team or player. If I had money in the world I would win all of the money. Lol. Do you have a team or players?
Hahaha yes, me too!  Personally I like the Patriots and Brady.  He's a book author.
Yes, Brady is a book author. What does he write? What book did he write that he is the author of?
Yeah he wrote the book, it's an athletes' bible, which he also credits with helping him get to the top of his game.
I think he is trying to be an antiathlete.  How can a Bible help people?  How does a bible help?
I have no idea. Did you know women can play in the NFL?
No, I did not know that. That's cool. I guess they could have a team full of women. A team full, not of pink and purple, but of roses and lace.
Interesting. Bowlers apparently made more than football players in the 1960s, but I wonder how much that is, because I don't think I've seen it.
I think it was because people loved bowling so much in our culture. I was born at the wrong time.
Yeah that was definitely the case back then.  I wonder what the highest score in college football is?
What is the highest score? Do they win money? Do you win money with the highestscore?
222-0! I wonder if that is the most in history or just the only one?
I feel like the team that win was the worst bullies ever. They looked like the worst team that won.
Cumberland had a bad day.  ESPN won an Emmy, I wonder why ESPN won it?
Cumberland had a bad year, and ESPN won an award for the best line? seems a bit silly, I wonder if ESPN won it for the line?
Yeah I think so too, I think that line would have made out lives easier on the field. Did you hear about the tracking chips that the players get for using in the field?
Yes, I did. They want to figure out how to prevent injury by the players. That is going to be watched carefully, I am sure.
Yeah I hope so! I wonder what the stats are. Did you hear of that ridiculous rule for the New Orleans cheerleaders? I think that is a ridiculous rule.
I didn't see that.  Why do cheerleaders get treated so badly?  I enjoyed the chat but I must go, have a good day!
I hope they get rid of that rule soon! It's not right! Have a good one!
Good afternoon! Are you a fan of Tom Brady? He is amazing. He is still going strong at 40!
I am, he is undeniably a great QB, but has a lot of problems right now.
He has many things I question about him, one of the main issues being his method, I have concerns about his method of getting the ball to him, among other things I'm question
I think it's cheating, I do not feel like it is a method the book he wrote is a better way to do so, I think it is cheating.
Yes, I guess it is sort of considered a bible for athletes, but it is not really mainstream beliefs as such.
I have not read it. I don't get the vibe of it being a self-help type book. I would think it would be much more.
It seems like it pushes the spiritual, creepy, cultlike in a way.  People say that the book is being equated to a cult by a noted Boston reporter name Bob Ryan.  He said the book "pushes a cultlike value on people" and "pushed the envelope of what people can believe in."
Wow, I didn't know that. Yeah, I think so too. Are you a football fan?
I am, I am not a big fan but its one of my favorite sports, what about you?
I am a fan as well.  Did you know that ESPN won an Emmy for inventing the yellow line that marks the first down line?  Can you imagine watching a game without that?
I can picture a game without it, sometimes I can't picture it without it superimposed on the screen.  Too many times I forget what a player is about and have to make it up as I go by.  It would just be a player on the tv screen.
Do you remember the Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis?
I vaguely do.  The Patriots have done an amazing thing with RBs since they have been in the league since 1960.  They are huge and really special for being the Patriots.
He is the only RB that has never fumbled a football his entire career.
Whoa! That's pretty special! I'm surprised! Speaking of careers, can you imagine a time when you could have had a bigger career as a bowler than a football star? I'm not surprised that a pro bowler didn't make as much as a football player. I can't imagine how that would have been.
I couldn't imagine that! I wonder if it ever happened. I remember it was randomly around for a long time, but I can't remember when that happened.
I didn't either.  Football was around for a time, supplanting baseball and left thePro bowlers to the dust for a decade.  I can't see it supplanting Baseball and left.
Good point. Do you know the highest score in football?  I had no idea.
I think it involved Georgia Tech.  I recall it happened way back in the 1960s, but I can't place the score or opposition.  It was probably in that decade, but can't remember.
I think it was Cumberland, the score was 222-0,
Wow, I heard that it didn't even reach half way when they scores that much! I wonder if they were able to reach half of that.
No, it was like scoring the entire time.
I love football or Tom Brady. Are you a fan of Brady and his method book?
I do enjoy football and I use the method aka the athlete bible.  I looked it up and it is the best way to stay in top shape in a few years.
I haven't either, I feel like the documentary is just kind of conceited, and he seems kind of self-satisfied, like he relates himself as the messiah, and the documentary says that 40 is the right age for football, and that there is an "older age for everything". I feel that 40 seems like an older age for anything.
I completely agree with you.  But, there are some humble athletes like Benjarvus Green-Ellis who has never fumbled the football in his entire pro career.
I completely agree with you there. I also think that ESPN was humble about the yellow line that they won an emmy for as recently as in 2013! Have you heard about that?
Agreed. They also used the chips they plant in the shoulder pads to record the players' every move. Now that is innovative.
I would like to see a replay of a touchdown and a replay with those chips in the footballs to decide if the touchdown is valid.
Good point! They can also track location, velocity, speed and rotation. I wonder how many touchdowns they can get away with that? I know they can track location and also speed, but how about velocity, and speed and rotate?
I wonder if that is why the long games have only 11 minutes are live gameplay?
No kidding. Engineers already make more than MLB and NFL players. They need to step their game up, considering the average lifetime earnings of MLB andNFL players are $8.5B and NFL is $122B. Engineers do a phenomenal job and need tostep their game
That stat actually surprises me, since football players work so much more. In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as football players.
I was not aware of that. That's sad and unfair. Too bad. The Saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to dine in the same restaurant as the football players. They are not allowed to be at the same place. Too sad and unfairly.
that is terrible. I wonder why they do that. I know the cheerleaders have to leave if they talk to the womens and have toLeave if they want to leave.
I'm surprised no lawsuits have been filed against the nonsense. There are no rules forbidding a female to ever play if they meet the eligibility requirements. They can keep playing as long as they're the best player drafted, which is any player that can meet the requirements and is old enough to be playing asLong as they are under the same rules forbidded by the player drafted.
I'm sure there's been some trouble before.  The University of Iowa had the visiting locker room painted pink.  Wonder if that tactic works?  They have the visiting room painted Pink!
I think it sounds like a way to get motivation.  Cumberland had the highest score ever for a score in a lockerroom when Georgia Tech set a record by beating them 222-0!  I wonder if pink was needed for some sort of motivation?  Sounds like Cumberland didn't want to be in the lockerroom if they were already in the same lockerroomwhen Georgia tech set a new record, or maybe they needed some other motivation?
I'm surprised Georgia Tech wasn't able to stop it.  How do you feel about players praying before a game?  Jefferson made his own version of the Bible.  I wonder how that would go over in the US?
King Jefferson? I heard he cut out the supernatural parts of the Bible with a razor and he called his own version "the version of the fact" I'm sure that's what he called the other version.
That is crazy.  I wonder if that is why Roosevelt and Adams were the only two presidents that did not have swearing in.
I was surprised to know that. I found it interesting that it was a common requirement for kids to read the bible in school in the early 1900s, early in their elementary education. I wonder why it was not a common mandate in school then, but I'm surprised that now it is a common required in elementary education, but still.
Interesting.  Well, nice chatting with you!
Do you watch the NFL games?
I do not, but I have heard of the NFL, the National Football League.
Yeah, it is still around.  Bowling is a big deal nowadays.  Even though it used to be a bigger sport.
Bowling was a big sport because people found spouses and lost children to go bowling on the weekends and they would bowl for social purposes.
I guess so. Did you know U of Iowa's locker room for visitors is painted pink?
I wonder if that was meant to get into the players' psychology or if it is to make them donate to breast cancer research?  I wonder how that would work in the players', players' Psychology.
The highest score in football history is 222 to 0.  Do you know what is the highest score ever to achieve that?
Yes, that was the highest score in 1916 when the patriots played the Browns.  I think the players' names are actually higher than the highestscore, but I'm not sure.
No, the first one was by Georgia tech against Cumberland. They beat them 222-0.
222-0? I figured that Tom Brady gave a biblical whooping to the Browns. How does Cumberland play, I wonder? They must have cheerleaders for the Browns!
hahah good point!  I had no idea they had a defeat!  Do you ever watch the ESPN?
I do, I like football and especially the NFL, and sometimes Spanish soccer.
Yes! It is a channel that shows sports and they won an Emmy for it. They also invented the superimposed yellow line in football, and they invented a channel for that. They won an emmy for that, and for a channelthat shows sports.
What an odd connection for an Emmy. I wonder why they won it for that yellow line. I don't even know if they won for anything else.
It is a Emmy, an award and yeah kind of strange, a lot of people are watching the game at home and they get the award andYeah kind of weird,
I guess you could always watch a game on tv there. I didn't know that they needed an award for that. I guess the way sports have changed, they needed to have an award to help them.
Yeah, and who is Benjarvus Green-Ellis?
I only have the acquaintance of his name.  It's been a pleasure.
Me either. He is a great player though, he never fumbled the ball in his career and never fumbles once!
I can barely hold a beer without spilling it, but I can barely holding a beer for my dog. That is incredible that he never fumbled!
haha ya me too! It was really nice chatting with you!
Tom Brady is a football player?
I think he doesn't get the credit he deserves but I do give him that, I saw Tom vs Time documentary it totally changed my mind, I am a fan now lol, I think he got the creditHe deserves, and I liked the documentary it's totally changed me too, what about you?
I didn't see the Tom vs Time documentary but I did see the Patriots when they won the Super Bowl in 2016, trailing 3-28 and only trailing by 3, and then they won.
Behind the scenes, you can see how he prepares for the NFL season, both physically and mentally. He's pretty much in it every day all year long.
I find that a little creepy, but I think it is related to his method.  I think I like that method better than the creepy ones.
I think it is a bit, but I respects him for the health and lifestyle decisions he makes. He credits the TB12 method book for helping him to stay on top of his game and the documentary, which is a little bit more than that, but the method book is also used in a documentary about the game in some respects.
He gives advice to football player to "stick to it" and get in football and physical shape.
That's a tough call. The book does focus more on football, but I think there is crossover between that and a heathy diet and lifestyle approach, so maybe he should.
I think it can help, but it's impossible to be able to improve your alimentation and not have a toxic lifestyle at the same time.  I think in every aspect, we need to improve one aspect, but not the other.  We need to be willing to try and improve yourAlimentation at the right time.
That is true.  Football is so crazy in the game, the highest score ever in a game was in 1916, Georgia tech beat cumberland 222-0.  I wonder what that means?
Yeah that is. I feel for the losing team. They had to laugh at that one too.
lol.  I would throw my hands up and say "I don't have an education and I don't want one".  I think I would be the only one to do that lol
I would learn something from that loss, I hope he didn't get injured or something.
I agree with that. Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the football in his NFL career. That is pretty impressive!
I wonder how long he has played in an NFL career and if he fumbled the football.  Maybe he has a long NFL career, or maybe it is all the data they gather from the sensors and chips they put in all the equipment and the data from the data he has fumbled.
I don't know, I don't think they are analytical.
I can't imagine watching football on a television without the yellow bar for the first down.
Didn't ESPN win an Emmy for that?
Yeah, I think it was shown that it was the kind of product that people needed and it was really shown for what it was.
That is true.  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much money as the top football stars of that era.  Times are a different number now.  The top bowler's made twice the money.
Yeah, but the average lifetime salary of an engineer is higher than the average Lifetime salary of a pro footballer for over 20 years. So they earn a lot more, but yeah, I wonder how low the pro bowler salary is. Maybe the salary of the engineer is high, but a pro football player is likely to earn a whole lot more than a pro bowlers salary.
Yes and engineers have a longer career which makes sense, but still.  It was nice chatting with you this morning, I hope you have a good day.  Hope you have another good one.
It does not mean a long career if you have physical injuries, I am not an engineer, but I do not think you can have a long careers unless you have a really long career and you have one. Thanks for the conversation as well.
Are you a Tom Brady fan?
No, in fact I am not. I heard that Tom Brady treats football like a religion.
Well apparently he wrote a book about his method, it's called "The Religion of the Method".  I've read it but never read it.
No I haven't, but I heard about the book, it's branded as the athlete's bible, but that's probably just another book, isn't it?
I'm not sure if I'd care to read it, it seems like some kind of cultist. I'll stick to watching him make great plays and that's about it.
I can't talk about Tom Brady without talking about the football sport. In the 60's, top bowlers made twice as much as professional football players. Imagine if they did that for the football.
Yeah that's weird. I wonder how much his wife makes now?
Wow!  That's not much!  I wonder if it's due to the years football has been played professionally or if it is just due to how much an engineer would make when compared their lifetime earnings.  Did you know Tom Brady's earnings were more that an engineer's would make if he played professionally?
Wow, I think it is 10-15 but I am not sure.  I know he has millions that 40-50 but I don't even know what he has in millions that's 40- 50!
Agreed. Just wanted to point out that I don't know if women would be allowed to play in the NFL. I don'd like to see one, but I don' t know if they would meet the league's requirements for being allowed to plays.
I would love to see a women's league in football. Do you think they will have a women in the WNBA?
Did you know that the visitors locker room at the University of Iowa is painted pink? Talk about demoralizing!
Yeah, that would. Do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was?
No, what was it?
It was Cumberland and Georgia Tech back in 1916, the score was 220-0
Did you know that a football player never fumbled the ball in HS?
Wow, that must be quite the achievement.  I think he played for the Patriots.  Who was it?
Yep, he did.  That is amazing.  Do you know who Green-Ellis is?
Yeah, I know.  Hey did you know that the NFL only produced one left handed quarterback?
Yes only one and it was shaquem Griffin
I forget his name, he's in apocrypha, I'll have to check him out when I have a chance and don't forget! Nice talking to you by chance!
Are you a football fan?
Not really.  I know the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay, too small for the average nfl game.
I knew that, but I did not know the exact figures, I don't watch it that often, so I don'
We're starved for violence.  We want gladiators and combat... The NFL has no rule against female players.  Maybe women will come in.  There are no ruleagainst female players in the NFL.
I think they would be allowed but not sure if it would be good enough. They have to be strong enough.
Not sure. I am not sure if they can.
I have heard that tom brady eats avocado ice cream, is that a thing?
I think he has the cash to do that, ice cream is a disgusting name for it. It kind of looks like ice cream to me. He probably needs the cash for that.
Yeah, in a book, I heard that.
Yes the same thing, he has a book on avocado ice cream, I wonder if that's the same one
It is his book. He says that it is a philosophy about life and football and how to be healthy.
I think it is very popular though, he has a bunch of follower who buy the book, so he must have a bunch  of followers who buy it.
Yes, it is a best seller, it doesn't sound like it is. Are you a Tom Brandy fan?  I am.  He's a TomBrandy fan.
He won many super bowls and also married a model..so he must have won many Super Bowls.
I'm a fan, but not really a fan of him.  He seems kind of full of himself and his age.  Are you rooting for any of these other guys?
He's in his sunset years, I hope to retain the vigor of youth, and access to avocado ice cream.
That sounds kind of good,  avocado and  ice cream!  I've heard of worse combinations for the ice cream,  but I've never tried avocado and it sounds kind,  I heard of better combinations.
I guess it is a winning combination, but I don't know how well a judge could be judge of that. Do you like tom?
It's hard to argue with his success so far so it's hard not to.
True, I guess he has many years of playing success still left in him.  Great chatting with you!  Guess I have to get going.  Have a good evening!
You too!  Thanks!
Did you hear about the New England Patriots and Tom Brady?
I have heard any updates on the superbowl and recently. Robert Kraft, the Patriot owner is still the same as before the Superbowl.
I have heard a little bit about him and his opinion that football is a spiritual quest by the way.  It's like Brady's religion, Gothic Chopra and his spiritual quest, I heard.  I wonder if that's his opinion of the sport?
I have heard of him, I saw the documentary, Tom vs. Time.  Did you see that documentary?
No, sounds like an inspirational show but also a strange one. I am interested to find out how spiritual things are connected to football, sounds as if spiritual things and I would be interested to see it.
I forgot about that sort of thing, I wonder if it's broadcasted, maybe it's on netflix or something, I know that there is a series of them that's on there, I think it's just not being broadcasted here, and yeah I think they revealed the name of the great player, I forgot his name, but I think its on net Netflix or something.
No, I don't think I've ever had a subscription to it but apparently it also airs on Facebook. I think I have a Facebook watch. I'm not sure if it's just a Facebook Watch or not, but I do know that Brady's mental and physical preparation goes way beyond just spiritaul side of things.
Yeah, I don't have a subscription but I have a friend who does, and he told me that he has completely changed his opinion on him and told me he was liking how he chose that platform to air it, he said he was thinking and respecting the guy, and that completely changed the way he is thinking and respects him now.
No, I don't have a subscription either, but I do watch it on Netflix.  I figure sooner or later someone will be thinking of him as success as Tom Brady.  He has the most of the success, even though the Patriots are not a subscription.  Did you know that the Patriots have never had a QB with a 100% success?  That's a figure sooner than I would have ever been able to figure.
That is true, Netflix will be here soon, I hope. I like that ESPN won an Emmy for the yellow line that they use for the first down line on games, the yellow Line for the Yellow line. I wish I could win an award for that, I wish ESPN won a Emmy, they did win an Emmy!
That will happen!  On the other side of the state, the Patriots are garnishing some real success Tom.  The Patriots are Garnishing a lot of New England talk.  They are the state team on Sundays and the churches around here are all in palpitations.
Yeah I think that's because of all the Patriots fans living in the area and all the other Patriots fans as well.  At the University of Iowa, the visiting football teams' locker rooms are painted completely pink and are known as the "PINK Locker Rooms".  They must really like the Patriots because all of the visiting Football teams' rooms are actually pink.
I think the opposing team is going to feel the wrath of the opposing. I have to admit that this years Super Bowl was a little more exciting. The patriots pulled out the overtime to win the game. It was the first in overtime since 1991 that the opposingteam has been able to win, and the patriots did it again. It took them overtime to winning in this years super bowl.
I think that method does work, it is good that the term stands up, the Super Bowl game last year was entertaining, it was good to see a method does Work
no, what is it?
I think so, I think you are allowed to eat a certain few items per day and it is a diet.
Yes maybe.  It's amazing how much nutrition has to do with entire lifestyles of spirituality, fitness, fitness and even nutrition.  I think it's just philosophies and stuff like that.  Did you know that former patriots RB Benjavus Green-Ellis has never fumbled in his NFL career?
That is impressive, I wonder if Tom brady helped him achieve that feat, religion and the game of the game, Tom Brady's jersey number is #41, I think that was his number
That sounds inspirational!  Correct.  I was guessing that it was his method.  It sounds inspirational, but I wonder what other teams he would participate in.
Yeah I think the schools should require reading the Bible as part of the educational curriculum.
I think it is not a bad idea.  It is a good thing in my opinion.  Teaching morals and ethics is a very good thing.  Its been great chatting with you.
Do you watch the NFL?
Yes, I do, I go to some games every now and then. How about you?
Nice. Do you have a favorite player or team?
I like the Patriots and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, how about you?
Nice, I love the patriots and Brady as well.  There is an author that has a book about the patriot's and Brady.
I did not know that.  I'm going to look him up now.  Do you like to read?
No. I have not.  I am not a guy that thinks women can play in the NFL.  Did you know women can plays in the nfl?
I did know that.  I wonder what they would do with that. I think as long as it is done in a fair way and with the right method that is a deal.  How long would it take?  What method would be the best?
I do not know that, is it the Brady lifestyle brand?
Yes it is. I love avocado! I even have a flavor of avocado ice cream, I love Avocado.
I love it too. What kind of ice cream? I hear that Brady keeps healthy by sticking to a certain kind of Ice Cream.
I would like to find a old film of the film that is tom vs tom vs Tom, and see if I can find it.
I haven't seen it yet, but I heard about it.  I do know that Brady says he's ready for the NFL season.
I haven't seen it yet. I know Matthew Slater and Tom are good friends, but I don't know if I've ever seen them as a team together.
Nice!  I heard that they are placing tracking chips on the players so I will be checking that documentary series out soon!
Yes, and they are thinking about doing that for the shoulder pads and footballs too. I think that is a great idea. The average NFL player is only wearing four shoulder pads, so it will be a great ideas in the long run for engineers to come up with.
Yeah, but football players don't make as much over the lifetime.
Yes. I saw pictures of a real building in modern day Iraq that is the Etemenanki, it is in pictures but it is a realBuilding
No, but I hear that people go there to visit and that they have the tower of Babel and the Tower of Babel.
I would like to visit Iraq too, I want to visit iraq. Anyway, great chat!
Yeah, maybe in the future when things calm down, I think!
Do you watch the NFL?
Hi, yes, I do, but I am not a fan of the game. How about you?
Nice, I do too. Did you know women can play too?
Yes, in fact, I do know that fact! I would be curious to see a woman on the team. I wonder what the name of the team would be.
I think I have made it to the highest score in college football, but I'm not sure what it is. What is the highestscore?
222-0, amazing to see your team lose so handidly, how bad your team must be playing to have to lose soHandidly.  Tom Brady must have been doing something right to have been able to do that.
Yeah most players his age are pretty much at the point where their careers are shorter, and yeah most players at his age make less money than engineers, I guess they make less than engineers too,
Interesting. I didn't know a kicker could still be playing. I guess there is one that plays a game for $1,000 for every 1,000 plays.
Yeah I think so. Did you know that ESPN won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow line for the first down line?
I did not know that, I wonder if they did that for the 30 minutes of actual time it took to do that, technology has changed the game so much
Yeah and we are glued to the tv for hours, it seems!
The Super Bowl was an entertaining game, I'm happy Brady won, but it wasnt the most entertaining game I have seen in a while, add to that the comcerials, it took 3 hours, I wasnt sure how much longer it was going to last,
Yeah a lot of people were happy, including me.On another topic, do you like the bible?
I was raised with the faith but havent really read it.  I didnt have any of my children read it,  or my children's read it if they had faith but I didnt.
I was surprised by that too. Jefferson created his own version of the education system, part of which was the use of the Bible. I wonder how long it took them to get that version of our education system up to the part where they read from a bible.
Yes, I did know that. It would have been fascinating to learn. I am more interested in the translation of Apple's "Good and Evil".
Yeah that is pretty cool.Roosevelt and Quincy also opted not to use a Bible to swear in but instead just used the bible.
I'm suprised, what was the reason behind that?
I bet it was because they were religious and opted to not go to the Tower of Babel, or they werereligious and opted for the tower of Babel.
I dont, ive heard of it,  but I dont know too much,  I am interested in it though,  it kind of defines why people speak different language,  kind of defining why people can speak it
Apparently people in the etemenanki used to use it in modern day Iraq before they became a people in modern Day Iraq
Hello there, do you enjoy football?  Are you a fan?
A fan of football? I mean the American version, not the soccer that they call football in other countries (which is also known as soccer in some other countries) but I am also a fan of Football, the American Version.
I am aware of that but I am more into american football.  I can't imagine that in the 1960s top bowlers made twice as much as top football players.  Did you know that in 1960 top bowlership made twice what top football player made?  I wonder how that is?
Yeah, I did not know that.  I think bowling is broadcasted on sports stations so I probably watch it when I can.  Do you know how much bowling is Broadcasted onSports stations?
I feel like it's been around since the 1940s, which is a long time.  I guess it's not randomly available.  The highest score in football is 222 to 0.  That's the highest score ever.
I don't know the high score but it's hard to imagine a game with only eleven minutes of live gameplay.  Hard to imagine that.
Wow, that is insanely small.  Georgia tech defeated Cumberland in 1916 with a score of 222-0!  That is such a small amount of gameplay, and Georgia tech defeats Cumberland by a scoreOf 222- 0!
Wow, that is insane, I would call it quits at some point in the game and then go in.  That must have hurt my pride a lot at one point.
Good question.  I think that with constant scores, it is just points.
Yeah, but they still get horrible treatment at the present of NFL players. Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from dining at the same restaurant as any NFL players and also the Saints cheerleading are forbidden to go in the same room as any player.
I did hear that and I was angry when I heard it. I think it's upsetting, I mean if a cheerleader is already eating, it makes you think they should just stop eating and leave. It disgusts me to hear that, it really makes me want to stop eating too at a point because I would just be so angry.
Yeah, it doesn't really serve the best benefit to the ego of football players or the football players at all. The rule just adds to the egos of the players and doesn't help them to serve the game.
I agree! Do you know they have tracking chips in players shoulder pads, football, and even tracking chips on the tracking chips  chips in player's shoulder pads?
I did not know that, but I wonder if they track their speed and movement or impact of tackles?
Probably.  It tracks velocity, rotation, rotation (ball speed, location) and also tracks velocity (ball location).  So, part of making the calls.  We rely on the technology, but reviews are a part of make-a-call too.
Yeah that's a great point. Players and their agents use that data to negotiate better contracts and salaries and it could be a great bargaining tool for them.
I agree, but it begs the question how would they know if the data is being used or not, I wonder if they have any data to use?
In any case, I think they are selling it for selling, but there are theories that they are just using it to help people in the digital age. Did you know that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an NFL player or an engineer?
I have no idea, I heard there is no idea. I'm surprised more people don't have a football career though. I am hoping it's because it's hard on the body. I was hoping it was hard on my body.
I agree, it is definitely a very physical and injury inducing sport. It is smart to be smart in the NFL. What could that possibly mean females would be allowed to play?
That is true.  I wonder why that is?
Do you watch football?  I do.
I love football!  I didn't realize the season lasted only 11 weeks in 1916!
I guess with 32 teams playing at the same time, and 17 teams playing each other at theSame time, yeah pretty long.
Yes and then they get to rest one weekend in between each season
I did.  That's crazy.  I know U of Iowa painted their visitor's locker room pink.  How does that work?
Yes,that is so funny, I wonder if that was a joke on the other team, or if they really did it to intimidate the otherTeam, or yes,that's just funny
wow, I had no idea. I know that bowlers used to make more than football players, but I had not idea. Did you know bowlers actually used to be better?
I wonder if things would be the same today.  Things have really changed and even now, today engineers make on average more than football players but it is not popular today.
Yeah I guess the career of a football player doesn't last long enough for time to make money.
True, but you can learn about interesting statistics like ball rotation and players performance.  I like to learn about ball speed, and other statistics.
Yeah, the players have these tracking chips in their shoulder pads, and the tracking chips are in theiroulder pads. Pretty cool!
I find that pretty interesting.  Do you know what the highest score ever in a football match was?  It was 222 to 0.  That was in 1916.
Yeah, in 1916 Georgia tech beat Cumberland 222-0!  I wonder what that game was?
Crazy, that happened about 100 years ago, right?
Yup, did you know women can play too?
I did not know that but if you meet the requirements you can, so a strong woman can do it, do you think it can happen?
Yeah, I hear there is no rule against New Orleans cheerleaders, did you hear about that?
Yes, I learned about that, I wonder if they are able to go to the same restaurant where an NFL player eats?
That's a sad rule. The worst part is that if a player walks in, they have to leave mid meal.
I wonder how long that has been going on, and how many types of football they have had that rule, I know that there are many different types of Football but I wonder how many different they can do.
Yeah like soccer, canadian football, Australian, rugby, and Canadian football, they are all fun, I think.
Hi, are you a Brady fan?
I love Tom Brady! In fact, I've been wanting to study up on his method aka the athlete's way of staying in shape for a few years now. I'm wanting to studies the bible to stay on top of the fact.
I've heard of it and read about it before but never read it.
Tom vs. Time series that recently premiered on Facebook watch. It's a TV series that focuses on the physical, mental preparation, and spiritual side of the Tom vs. time series.
That sounds awesome!  It does have some religious overtones but I am uncertain if it has any religious overtone.  I admire his dedication tot he craft of football.
Agreed.  Are you a football fan?  I am.  I like how they have a 16 week regular season from September to December.  It used to be 13 but I think it is no longer necessary with the 17 week regularSeason that is going on now.
yup, it leaves you wanting more with only 11 minutes of actual playtime per game.
That is true.  There are no rules against women playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements.  I wonder if we'll ever have a female kicker?  There hasn't been a female kick off since the 1960's.  They don't have rules againstWomen playing asLong as they can meet the eligibilities.
Yeah, I think that is a good position. I don't see any minimum eligibility requirements for a kicker, but it is a really good position for them.
That's a good question! I wonder if entering the engineering field would be better pay? Engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players, simply by simply entering the field.
That sounds right. I think it would be hard for the bowlers to get paid more than NFL athletes.  I mean they get paid way more, but that's the NFL.
It is hard to believe! I also think it's amazing that someone like Benjarvus Green-Ellis gets paid more than that! He's a RB who has never fumbled the football in his entire pro career!
Yeah I wonder that as well.  I bet if he dropped his wallet it would be in there.  He should give himself an ESPN Emmy for the performance.  For creating the superimposed yellow line that helps give a first down, that was an ESPNEmmy.
That yellow line was definitely innovative! I think similar to the chips embedded in the shoulder pads thay records each players every move.  It's incredible how much we know about them now.  With chips embedded into the shoulder pad thay thay Records each players Every Move!
It is creepy, like a big brother watching you every step you take.
Yeah true. There is a chip planted in the ball that tracks location, speed, velocity and rotation, and there is also a chip in the balls itself that tracks speed, location, velocity  and rotation.
That is creepy!  I heard it is used to restrict movements of chearleaders of the New Orleans Saints!  That makes more sense than that.
I have not. I am surprised by this rule, but I also think that it's very misogynistic and very silly that the Saints have a rule like this. I think cheerleaders are more classless than any of their cheerleaders so I'm surprised by the lawsuits filed against the Saints for such a silly and silly rule. Still, that's worse than Georgia tech humiliating Cumberland 222-0, the worst football game in history, and yet no lawsuits have been filed against them for humiliating Cumberlands 222- 0.
That is humiliating. I don't know how the Univ of Iowa is able to do it. They have a pink lockeroom where they can keep them when they aren't dressing up. I wonder if that is where they keep them in the pink locker room?
Good thing I didn't say that earlier! Can you imagine being talked into being an athlete for a regular "good" or "bad"? I guess that is what they call it. I would call it "being bad" for sure.  Did you know that the best selling and influential book of all time, the Bible, has sold over 5 billion copies!  Can you guess who talked about it earlier?  I wonder if any other time or any other book has sold more than that?
I know the apocrypha is an awesome book.  Nice chatting with you about that awesome book!
I find it interesting that they are drawing religious parallels between the New England Patriots and the NFL fan.  I like the Patriots.
I am not but I know the New England Patriots players are well favored to be the ones to win their second Super Bowl LI and their sixth NFL championship.  They are also favored to win the sixth Super Bowl LII
Brady is the athletes bible.
Chopra also knows Brady's religion, which he credits with helping him stay on top of his game at age 40.  He's the only football player and top QB he credits his religion with helping Him stay in the game at aged 41.
Yep, and he has a fan base that worships coach Bill Belichick.  In Bill we Trust, pat on the pat, we trust!
I am a football fan and a great loss for a football Fan, I wonder if Brady turn into spiritual life and if that was on purpose or not, what a great lost
Matthew Slater of the team is actually a evangelist off the field and not only on the field.
I know a lot of Patriots fans think that Brady is some kind of messiah figure.  He seems like some kind Of messiahfigure.
For sure, it is almost like a religion for them. He show no sign of quitting football though, he is all about health and nutrition, he seems to show no signs of quitting
Football is a game of the nation.  We need healthy food and regular exercise to make them fit.  It is essential for them.  Even with a small injury, the nation would be upset because they are playing in the game.  They need to get healthy food to make sure they are fit and get enough exercise to be able to play.
I bet the fans for Cumberland were upset when they were beat by Georgia Tech 222-0.
It would surely be shocking to see that.  Surely not as shocking as the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting football team is completely painted with pink!
That's funny they would go all out for pink.  Wow, did you know in the 60s pro bowlers made twice as much as top football stars?
On Oct 11, 1916, a sad day for Cumberland Bulldog, they lose the match with georgia tech.
Did you know that the NFL has no rule against females playing the game?
The biggest rule I can think of is that if an NFL player comes into a restaurant and there is a cheerleader required to leave, they are not allowed to eating in the same restaurant, if a cheerleaders there are dining in the restaurant, they would be required toLeave.
Yeah, I heard about that. It is amazing that an NFL game has only 11 minutes of live game play, and the Saints only had 1 in the whole game against the Saints.
The NFL uses tracking chips in player shoulder pads to record the movement on the field.
Yes, it's so high-tech! Did you know that the tower of Babel is a real building in Iraq?  That's wild!  I wonder if it's the Tower of Babel, or a real Building?
I know the bible is considered the product of divine inspiration and record a relationship between god and human,
Thanks for the chat! :)
Did you hear that the Patriots football team in the NFL won the superbowl in 2016?
Yeah,  yeah,  I did lol
I know right, a prayer for you to win!
I think Brady is the best at that method but I don't know for sure.
I wonder if they used his method?
Bradys method is the number 12 and involves his avocado ice cream, I like the Patriots, do you like the patriots?
I heard about the avocado ice cream.
That's interesting.  I have never seen that before.
What's weird is that the Patriots are so far behind the Patriots, they don't seem to have the skill to keep up, that seems weird
I dont know, they have been so dominant lately and I dont know how they are able to stop them.
He probably has a method that makes him unstoppable, or at least a method thats what they say.
I'm not sure.  Football is a religion, but maybe that is it.
He's a coach, so he must be concerned about the game as well as faith in church.
Bill we trust motto is "We are all the messiah, not the people who think we are the messianic one."
I see. Do you watch football? I did not watch football until recently.
i dont watch it either.  lack of cable, i think.
I have Roku which streams shows but I don't have cable but they show the superbowl on TV every few minutes.  I think they show it on Roku which streams shows that are on for at least 30 minutes.
I have Roku and it is an important part of my news.
I am not sure at the moment, I have lots of things free to do, but I would like to buy one. I think I cut down on my computer use, I only watched TV on it, so I get lots of Things free, it's crazy how far I have cut down.
I think its a good option, I am watching a lot of sports, so that would be a good one to try out.
Do you buy sports packages? It's not for my taste. I don't like them.
That is awesome!  Great chat!  Have a good night!
Good morning! Do you like football? Are you a fan of Tom Brady?
I do like Bill Belichick coaching, I read books and articles praising his leadership and asking questions of him, and I have read books AND articles praising him.
No doubt he is the best coach ever, and Brady is one of the best too!  Have you seen the documentary Tom vs Time, Brady vs Time?
No, I never saw the documentary, I've heard of it, is it on Netflix?
I watched one of the episodes on Facebook the last time I was on Facebook and it totally changed the way I thought about Brady. It's not the documentary that I was a big fan of, but it really puts a lot of work into the craft and really changes the way you think about him for sure. I'm not a big follower of Facebook, but I've watched the whole documentary and I have a lot more liking of his now. I've seen a couple episodes and my thought process about Brady has totally changed.
Wow, that documentary really changed my perspective about the guy. I've never heard of a documentary about his diet, have you?
I have not heard about that. What is that?
Yes there is an extreme diet called "Organic" method of eating. He eats certain natural produce, good carbs and he eats certain Natural produce. I forgot what the name stands for but he can play if he does it right. I think he is getting good carbs, but I'm not sure.
That's interesting!  Did you know that the NFL has no written rule against female players?  There is no writtenrule against female player.
Wow, I didn't know that.  I can't recall ever even hearing of another female player in the NFL.  Imagine that garner a lot of attention in the media.  Do you think they would ever let a female player on the field?  I recall hearing there was a few female players on the media, but I can only imagine that's garner a little too much media.
Someday, maybe.  There is only an average of 11 minutes of actual live gameplay in an NFL game.
I think if the games were longer than 11 minutes of live gameplay, I would devote an entire afternoon and evening to them. I would be a couch potato for the day in front of the TV and only devote eleven minutes oflive gameplay. I wish my day were longer, and I could devote an whole day in the front of my TV.
lol I don't mind it, I like watching the games, its my chance to unwind after a work week and I don not mind having the chance to relax and just watch the games.  In the 1960s bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that era.  I can't believe that in the 1960's bowlers make twice as many as top Football players.
I find it hard to believe that's still true today with all the emphasis on salary of football. The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is actually higher than football players, but I find it's hard to see how an engineer could have an average lifetime salary that's higher than that.
Engineers have longer careers too.
Good point.  I would imagine multi-million endorsements would be higher.  The players' salary is probably higher too.
It is incredible they have chips in the footballs to track velocity now, they also use chips in all of the football's to track Velocity
That is pretty neat, I wonder if they released some of this data after they released them?
No, I don't.  That's funny!  I always hear soccer being referred to in other parts of the world as "football".  I wonder if they have ever tried it?
Yeah, that throws me off a bit when you say that, because football is a big sport here in the US, throws off the whole bit. Soccer is one of my favorite sports, though.
I am a big baseball fan. Nice chatting with you today.
Hey there!  Are you a Tom Brady or NFL fan?
I'm a Pittsburgh Steelers fan and he made it to the playoffs, but lost shortly after.  I'm not sure if it was his first playoff.
Did you hear about the players leaving? Tom Brady is the only QB to have a bible in his bible.
He is great. His bible helped him to win games at an age he was not great at. I think the Bible helped him in more ways than one.
I guess so, lol, do you ever watch college football? I guess I used to, but not so much anymore, do You watch it?
I do like college football!  I watched the big game Alabama vs Clemson, they are two of the toughest teams out there, pro and college.
Yea that was a good game, I am an Iowa Hawkeye fan and that's why the visiting locker room is pink
No, I did not know that! I have read there is a reason that it is for the players, I think the Hawkeyes are pretty good, though I am not too sure what that is.
I agree, and they always disappoint me. I like it when NFL games are longer in total playtime too. NFL games only last 11 minutes but in NFL games is only 11 minutes, not 11.
Yes, that's not counting commercials, running back time, quarterback time, kicking time, and kicking time during the 3 quarters...
I know the play clock runs on a play, but I wonder how much time it takes to do that?  How long do you think a play is ran before and after a play?
Yes, I think it does in my opinion. It also changes the time the players take off between quarters, with the games divided into 2 quarters.
They take the biggest beating from their bodies. Engineers created chips to track them in the shoulder pads and the shoulder blades.
I'm glad that the NFL improve protection for the safety of the players and the players themselves. I wonder if they can track that in the NFL?
Do you watch ESPN?  I do.
I watch ESPN for the college football. Its my favorite channel, do you have a favorite channel ?
I do. I think it's interesting that it won an Emmy once for that yellow line that shows the first down line that Shows.
I know ESPN has it on their lines to tell if the line is on the field.
I bet it's really crazy. Anyways it was good chatting with you friend!
It was crazy. Nice chatting with you as well!
bye!  have a good one
Hey there!  Do you like Tom Brady?
I really do not know him. How about you?
He is a quarterback in the NFL, he is known for winning superbowl games, he has been winning superb Bowls since 2001.
He has a tremendous talent! He is really good at singing and dancing.
I am not sure. Do you know what type of religion he is or how he views football?
He even has ordained one of the services he leads. He has them sing and dance in exultation when they are in the NFL.
I'm not sure how to answer that question because he's not really religious, but a lot of the Patriots team members are. Do you watch football?
I watch it sometimes. I don't understand why he wouldn't watch though. He told them it was sinful. He said he has studied more than the bible. He is from the US, he says. I understand why.
A lot of people ead the bible, but i am not religious. I follow it when I can, but not as much as the NFL. A lot ofPeople ead to follow it. The Bible has sold over 5 billion copies in the time it has been around. It is more than football. I think it is the NFL!
I think a lot of people do eat the bible. I wonder if it is comestible, if it can be eaten. If it's just pages, a lot Of people doEat the bible!
I have never read the Bible, but I know he wrote ead in a error, he meant to say life is like that. I wonder what he wrote?
I have not.  I do know that it is valuable and I find myself using it in emergencies just in case.
It is a pretty good thing to have.  Do you like the NFL team the Patriots?  They have a religion where they are focusing on their religion as a focal point during games and it is the focal point for their NFL team.
Yes. I wonder if that is kind of cheating or if it gives them an advantage. I don't think it is, but it might give them an edge.
I have no idea, I would think so but god know what I would do in my everyday life be cheating. I don't think it would be in a football game.
It is appealing to a higher power, and it can shift the game in your favor, but I don't know that it is really. The bookies want to spread the bet, and if it is reflected in the spread, then the higher power must be in your Favor.
I'm not sure, but I'm sure they know the answer to that one. I also know a few fun facts, like the biblical tower of Babel is based on a real building in Iraq and not the biblical building in the Bible, yay!
Interesting! I wonder why that is?
Fun bible fact - Thomas Jefferson created his own Bible - he cut out the parts that he did not like, and cut out all the others.
I guess that makes sense. he disliked the parts about religion so he would throw them out. he would have disliked the part that he did not like.
I guess so. Did you know patriots player rb benjarvus green a player in the nfl never fumbled a ball in his entire football career?
I guess that was a pretty good thing to do. I figure he got some special money because of that promotion.
Football is a great sport, I like that the NFL doesn't read their bibles and focus on god during games and they do it so well.  Football is a very great sport.  Well, it's been an interesting chat, I think I'll go read my Bible now!  Have a great day!  Bye!  Thanks for the interesting chat!  I think the NFL should read their Bibles and focusing on god more!
Are you a football fan?
Good morning, yes I am.
I watch mostly college.  I tend to watch mostly around playoff time.  What about you?
Cool, do you like NFL football?
Did you catch the Superbowl this year? Pretty soon Brady will be able to run with his fingers to put those rings on, I think.
I didn't, I sat through it, it was too long.  I did know one thing that always makes me mad, though, is that the average NFL game is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay.  An average NFLGame is 11 hours and 17 minutes of actually live gameplay!  That's so long!
I think they should have a running clock or something to give more action.  It's like waiting for the game to get going, but then stopping it after two teams score, instead of waiting for one team to score.  I think they need a running Clock, it would give more activity.
Yes, it would.  It would be interesting to see what the data shows from the tracking chips on the player's shoulder pads that records every move on the field.
I dont know how hard those guys get hit.  I dont think I could hit a 300 pound lineman.  The NFL doesnt have rules against female players, I dont know if they would impact it much though.  They have a rules against male players.  Did you know the NFL doesntHave rules againstfemale players?
I think a female could probably make things more interesting for sure on the field.
I think that would be better than what we had back in the 1960s when they had female on the officiating crews.
On a different note, do you ever read the bible?
I havent ever read it,  I havent never read a good deal of it, how about you?
I'm in the habit of reading to myself at night, before bed every now and then. My grandma used to do it for me every night.
I see, that's a good habit, have you ever translated into latin? Malus means apple and evil when it's translated into Latin, it's a really good habit to have
That is a tidbit that has been lost in translation!  How things get changed, that is for sure.
Probably a lot, and things that we dont even realize about them that we just dont even know about. Like what caused Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams to have to sworn in not using a Bible, but a different one.
Idk, maybe. I would like to know.
I dont know I dont think they used a law book, but I have heard in the most recent congress some people used a Koran at the swearing ins, and a lawbook for the swearing in.
Ole Thomas Jefferson used a razor to cut out the parts he thought were "supernatural".
He did a lot of significant stuff. Good chat, thanks.
Tom Brady sure does love his plan for life.
I agree, he is motivational with his method of doing it and very motivational, I like his method as well.
I think he has a athlete's bible that is a life example.  I would like to read that.  Maybe even read it before my life.
Do you like Tom vs. Time show on facebook?
Are you a spiritual person?
He does, he says he is just trying to give what he cannot compete with, but he is giving everything he has to life, a good quote, he will give everything he can to what he can, he is trying to compete in life.
I agree with McDougal, that was great.
He is the pastor of Richmond Community Church.  He is friends with McDaniels.
Yes, he is. He is on top of his game at age 40 and trying to stay on the top of the game at Age 45.
Well coupled with avocado ice cream, it is possible.
Did you know that the visiting football teams is completely painted pink.
Wow, I did not. ESPN created the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line in 1932.
It was a good invention.  It was used in 1916 for one Georgia Tech Cumberland game and that's when they called it quits.
Yes, that is crazy that they lost 222-0.
I know right, that is wrong.  Cheerleaders cant eat in the same room as the players, I wonder why.
Yeah they have to leave if they come in and leave if there is no one there. I am going to have to research that more.
Did you know there used to be a bowler who was a football player and also a bowLER?
I would rather be an engineer because their lifetime earnings are higher
I know right, The bible is the best selling book, there is a copy of the copy of it in every best sellingBook
Yes, it is.  Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams were the first two to do that.  I wonder why?
I guess so, did you know Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible, the "Bible" version?
Hi, are you familiar with the football?
I am kinda familiar with it, I watch it when I get a chance when I can.
Pretty much the same here. Do you have a favorite team or position?
My favorite team is the Patriots. I always root for the underdog and the Pats have reached the end of their reign. I really like Brady and the underdog has never done better. Who is your favorite team?
Brady is, but he is only 40 and has a lot of talented people who have been in the last few years like Green Ellis.
Very true.  I suppose Bill might not be as good as Brady, but I find that sometimes the dynasties end and I don't doubt it.  Although I don'm not sure that would be true. I think most dynastians end up being as good at whatever they find.
I think it will end soon enough
I think they do, I think their dynasty will end soon
I think it will be long before the coach retires, as long as their performance doesn't go down or key players change.  After winning the super bowl again, I can't see them not winning again.
As long as they keep it going, I am sure they will.
Hard to believe.  It was a good shot.  I don't think he will be in the superbowl, but he has a good Shot at it.
I bet they will be good, I think.
I bet I will too, I will do some research, but I will also bet, I think it will be based on my opinion, not just an opinion
Sound advice!  I have done some research on Tom Brady.  If I were in a wager wager with the Bible, I would wager on my kids' college fund!  The Bible is a divine guide for those who foolishly bet foolishly on great contests like that.  You have sound advice.  The Gang, the Bible and the Bible are the best way to get the college fund going!
I personally do not wager on sports games. I lose when I do. I read the bible when I wager.
I have in preparation for the Super Bowl and for predicting the outcome of sporting events.  Sometimes I use the wisdom to guide me and help me with my forecasts and in predicting the outcomes of sporting Events.
I think there is a lot of chance that they have a lot.  They do not know everything.
True, knowledge is shared and the bible will guide you, but if the Bible leaves you, it's true that there are great contests played out, selecting the victor of a beloved country, and if there's not a chance, knowledge and knowledge isshared, the bible'll guide you to selecting the winner.
In any case, good luck in your endeavors and thanks for chatting with me and good luck to you in your endeavours!
You too.  Thanks for the chat.
Have a nice day!  Thanks!
Hi, do you know much about the bible?
I know a little bit, what about you?
I see.  It's not uncommon.  In the US, students used to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education but that has changed.  I think in most of the country now, students are not required to have the bible.
It sure has.  I think it is because the religious make-up of the US is very diverse of the time.  All religions are inclusive and have their own religious make up, and that is inclusive.
True.  I think immigration has changed things for sure.  It's not the same way it was in that time.  We are used to being accepted for who we are and what we expect and how we look.
I can't imagine how it would have been.  I hear that Jefferson created his own version of the Bible.  Did you hear that?
He cut out the supernatural (or at least the supernatural) parts of the Bible, like the miracles and the resurrection. He wanted to have religion in humanist terms. I wonder if that means he cut out all of the miracles?
It's a very interesting approach, an attempt to understand, but also an attemptto make a more palatable version of Christianity, an attempts to make something more paliable for everyone, it's an interesting approach.
I don't know, but presidents Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams did not use a Bible at their swearing-in ceremonies and used a constitution.  I would think that presidents Teddy Roosevelt and John Adams would not make use of faith ceremonies to make a similar attitude toward the Bible.  Maybe it was because of their faith in the US constitution.
I suppose it's not the first time they did the same thing. I've always heard people complain about politicians being sworn in and not using a bible and the Bible as an opportunity, but I've never heard people complaint about politicians using any religion texts. I suppose it is a problem when there are too many religious texts, and politicians don't get the opportunity.
I don't either, I think that's just loyalty to the country.  I don't think people want to be associated with people who don't believe in what they believe in.
I totally agree.  Did you know that the tower of Babel was actually based on a real building and not a real built?  I wonder how it got its name.
I did not know that.  I would have expect that with all that connection to things around the world historically.  Did you know that the word "bible" was translated into Latin under the guise of the guise "apple" during the 4th century when the Bible was first translated into latin?  For some reason, the word 'bible' in that language means "evil" and "apple".  It's probably just coincidence or a coincidence that the Bible became known as such in Latin during the 6th century and was translated to the language of the world Historically, I expect.
Wow that is very interesting, I wonder if that is a metaphor for the fruit as well or just a metaphor.
That's a good possibility.  I don't think earlier readers would have understood the play on words, though.
Interesting.  The tower of babel is based on a building known as the Etemenanki in Iraq.  I wonder what the tower of Babel is based off?
that sounds reasonable, I think it is located in the middle east.
Good question, I have no idea.  I've never looked into it.  Maybe it's based on a real building?  I recently went to DC and looked it up.  No idea if it's even based on anything.
Thank you for the chat!  Have a good day!
I didn't realize that Christianity and Judaism were so closely linked.  It's shocking to me.  I have met many people who don't realize this.  Just wanted to note, though, that they are.  The texts are so closely connected.  So are Christianity and Judaism.
Yes, the bible has over 750 books and a pentateuch, not just one or two of the books of the Bible.
good point, do you like torah?
Hi are you a fan of the NFL?
Nice, yeah I do watch football, its my favorite sport, what about you?
Yeah i watch it from time to time.  I like tom brady.
I do like him.  I guess he's a great player for the Patriots, I watched him when he threw an amazing pass in the Super Bowl.
Yeah he is.  He published a book called "The best method", the author of this method.
What is the method? Is it just a method with a certain stages or rules?
Speaking of which, who is Benjarvus Green-Ellis?
Yeah, I heard of him. He played for the Patriots, right?
Yeah, he did. The guy never once fumbled the ball in his career.
wow that is amazing,  I dont know anyone that has fumbled a ball in a football,  thats a hard quest,  amazing,
Good for him! I saw that the visitor locker room at U of Iowa is pink. I wonder why?
College football sounds fun, that is a great tactic to make the other team mad.
Do you know what the highest score in football was?
I do not. I am not sure. Is that more soccer than football?
Yes the highest score is 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland in 1916. That game was in 1916, and it's the highest ever score.
Thats sounds like a massacre lol,  that would be such a boring game,  who looses by 222 points,  and how do you loose by 222 Points?  That must have been a boring games.
I don't know.  On another topic, do you like the Bible?
I'm not really a religious person but I read some verses as a kid, and read some of them as well
Yes, I am.  I know some facts from the Bible and I believe the education system uses it for facts in our education system.
I remember a story that the Babel Tower was a real tower, but I can't remember the name.  Did you learn about it?
Yeah, I think it is. It is in modern day Iran in the etemenanki (ender'sanki)
Yes very interesting and a nice building, a lot of history in that place, very nice building.
Hey! Have you heard about the lifestyle plan that Tom Brady has?
I haven't.  What's it about?
It's called the "method" of treating football, sounds like it's a lifestyle but it's really crazy how it's called.
Did you know that there are 32 teams in the NFL?  I wonder how many teams they all have.
I think it makes up the NFC and the AFC.
I know, right?  How many teams do they play?
There are 32 teams, the NFC and the AFC each send out 32 teams and the playoffs and then the Super Bowl.
Did you know the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay, an average n Fl game has only 11 minutes or so
I know, that's a drag. I wonder how much Tom Brady gets to playing in that 11 minutes a game. He's only got one.
Very true. Did you know New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player?
That seems extreme!  I did not know that!
I agree, I wonder if that is why the player has to leave if he is in a restaurant eating and a player comes in and says, "I have to leave!"
Oh my gosh! That is so right!
I'm not sure,  they seem very strict about it.  Do you ever read the bible?
I do, I read parts.  There is no true translation, only the greek one.  I think it is the best one.
I find it to be really hard to read.  I don't understand it at all,  but I do read the kid's version haha.
I have read the kid's version, too, I had some elementary students in my Read It Class do it. I think they were in the "you can read" class.
Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the bible, a version of it that he said was "better than the Bible".
I didn't know that. There are lots of our founding fathers who have weird religious ideas. Jefferson was one of them.
He had a razor and used it to cut out the parts of the resurrection, supernatural, and supernatural. He cut out all the miracles and the miracles of the supernatural.
Yeah, that sounds pretty weird, I would never follow something like that.  It's good to pick and choose what you like.
Do you watch football?  Do you like it?
I do sometimes. I see the chiefs are playing the pat this sunday.
Football doesn't really catch my attention.  There is only 11 minutes of live gameplay on average.  I wonder how fans and players view the sport.  Is it a religion?  Or a religion with only 11 seconds of liveGameplay?
That's ridiculous, but it's a very cultish method. Tom Brady is starting to look close to retirement, and he starts selling a book about his method, and the press is getting so cultish that he startsselling his success as a way to get close to the press, which is ridiculous.
Yeah, he should have an athlete's bible, "The Athlete's Bible" and stay at the top of his game.
A true fact.  In the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as football stars.  The game watching has grown.  Did you know that people work Monday, Friday, and Saturday so that they can go to the game on a Friday?  I wonder if this is a true fact?
That's insane! I did not know that. Did you know they have tracking chips in players shoulder pads and inside footballs and in the tracking chips and inside players shoulder pad?
That is amazing to think about.  With all the money thrown into it, it is amazing that an average NFL player in their lifetime earns more than an engineer who over the course of a lifetime earns as much as an engineer.
Interesting.  I worship NFL players.  It is amazing to me.  You know, I once thought that ESPN needed an emmy for making the first yellow line that was used for the first down for the NFL.  Seems silly.  Now I think they should have thought that espn needed an Emmy for making such a silly line.
That is funny since actors work for years and don't need it. I wonder what the rationale was behind it. Also funny, New orlean's team's cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as the players. If the players come, they must leave the restaurant. That is funny. I'm sure they can leave if the cheerleaders come in.
That seems kind of sexist. Speaking of sexism, did you know that women can play in the NFL if they meet the requirements of the NFL?  I mean women's sports are not the same as men's sports.  I wonder what people think that will happen.  If more women can get in and meet the necessary requirements, why can't we do the same.
I know, right?  There is no written rule that women cannot play in the NFL,  but meeting the requirements must be difficult and there is no writing rule thatwomen cannot play.
Yeah, I heard they are considering that.  I think that will change if they change anything.  Speaking of talented players, there's a really talented kicker, Benjarvus Green-Ellis, who has never fumbled the football in his NFL career.  He's a talented kicker.
Speaking of Tom Brady and his play, did you know that Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams were the only two presidents to not use religion while in office?  Teddy Roosevelt  and John Adams did not use a bible while inoffice, but use a religion of their religion when they were in office.
Yeah i did not know that.  Tom brady is trying to find the meaning of life in the football and not just the football.  I don't know how well it is going for him.
Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible cutting out the supernatural parts ( miracles) but he had a lot of followers because of his version of it. He said it had more miracles.
Hmm, that seems kind of extreme!  What is regarded as canonical varies depending on different traditions and groups and what is regarded to be canonical varies according to who you are.
I thought that too.  I did not know that when the bible was translated into Latin it was known as malus, apple and evil in latin, that is why I thought it was apple and good
I find it interesint that the Hebrew bible, Greek Septuagint and Christian Old Testament all overlap with the Greek SeptUagint, the Hebrew Bible.
It's interesting how the faiths overlap.  Did you know that the biblical towe of Babel was a real building, an Etemenanki in Iraq, a real built by a biblical toWe of Babel.
I know.  It's also included in all Christian denominations.  I can't believe there is disagreement among some of them, though.
do you like football? I like it.
Good morning, I enjoy a good football game. I am a Patriots fan so I like Tom Brady. What about you?
The patriots are the lanisters of football!
Sweet got reference there.  Coach Bilichek seems like he is always wanting to prove something.  Cold, cold, cold!  He's always trying to win and there's always a power struggle going on between him and the left.
I think you're right.
I've learned from the health community that there is a fitness routine and regimen for being in top shape that translates to winning on and off the football field, and achieving cult like status. I believe that is the best way to keep in top Shape, on and Off the Football field, but I don't know if it's the most appropriate routine for achieving cult Like Status.
He is an expert in how to performane, but he has proved that he is not an expert.
His life so seemingly perfect.  Career, family, career, celebrity, owner, and now celebrity.  Nothing seems to make it through his life.  Robert Kraft, his family, seems to be tangled up in everything he does.  There seems to always be a new scandal on the horizon, even bigger than Deflategate.  He's tangled up with the Krafts, his own family, and the owner of a team that seems to have more scandal on its horizon.
I feel like all celebrities are like that. It's hard to know what to do when their lives are under the microscope and paparazzi are everywhere. It is hard to not be like that with celebrities.
Yes, they do. They say it's because people are always jealous of their success. People want to bring them down and bring them Down. I think that pretty strongly, but the critics are always behind their success, it seems.
It is a shame. I think that is why he is the way he is.
I understand why the athletes want to play the game, but I can see how football purists would want to shut them down, or shut down the brand for the ratings and not play to the criticism. Times have changed and today it seems like athletes are willing to go against the football purist and play thegame, but the times have changed, and I think the brand will not last with all the criticism
Yes it has.  Is there a team of player you follow?  If so, what is his/her name?
I grew up in a family with a local team, so living in Phoenix, I follow the Cardinals as my allegiance.  My family's team is the favorite, and living in AZ, it's the local team with the most popular players so I root for their players.  What about you?  Do you have any favorite player?
I personally like the Patriots, what about you?
I think they are the pinnacle of success and achievement in the Boston sports scene. They have had a lot of recent success.
They are the lanisters of football
That is true, and it is so prevalent among the fans I suppose that the analogy between football and religion is so popular and so true.  The Bible.  There is an analogy between Football and religion and the fans.
I wonder how many fans like to play fantasy football? I know there's a dedicated few who are dedicated. Do you play fantasy?
I have never tried to play fantasy football, but I totally believe in it.  I've had good friends in a league and they have a great time playing it. I think it is hard to separate fantasy from reality, but they can separate fantasy.
In any case, thanks for chatting with me.
Do you watch the NFL?
I love the NFL! I love football and I love the nfl. How about you?
Same here. Did you know women can play too?
Yes there is no rule against that, but I have yet to see an actual league game with that rule
Nope there is no written rule against it. They are allowed to play if they qualify.
That is interesting.  I wonder how they do that?
It must be a tough women's game. The highest score ever in an Nfal game was 222 to 0.
I recall watching a documentary about it, I think it was by georigia tech vs the other team.
Yeah they played against U of Cumberland and totally crushed them, the best in history
They are remembered as the team that lost by 222 points, but they are not the only team that's lost by more than 100 points
Yeah. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?
Yes he was a football player who was on a at one point losing team
He is from the patriots. He never fumbled the ball once.
Wow, I heard that he never fumbled! That is amazing, I will have to Google that later and see if I heard about it, he must have been amazing.
Yeah that is pretty amazing. Apparently bowlers made twice as much as football players back in the 60s.
That would make sense, it was a more popular sport back then, I dont think there was a pro football player and a bowler making more money, it would have been a much more popularSport back then so it would make makes sense,
Yeah things really have changed.  On a different topic do you like the Bible?
My grandmother was very religious and she said that it was a sacred book.  I have read some verses and know a little about it.  Do you know it?
I was part of the program in my school when we were in school, but I never did it.
I didnt, I wonder what are your thoughts on that, is it imposed or just religion or is it something else, what are yours thoughts?
In fact, I think religion should be a free choice, but that's no longer the case, we should have a freechoice and that's why religion is in fact a choice.
Are you familiar with the NFL, or football?
I like the NFL, the National Football League, I have heard of it, I know its a round ball, right?
Yes, the NFL is the professional American football league.
Yes, that is the NFL. I understand you are familiar with the American football, or American Football, as you are not familiar with it?
Yes it has 32 teams and they have games from September to December, there are 32 games in all,
That does sound like intense. I wonder how many people watch each and every game. Do you think people watch it?
I think it is really popular in the United States because more Americans watch the games. The NFL and football are very popular in this country.
I think it is good for sure.  I'm always impressed by the team that has a good game, but the other team is never good.
I like the 49ers because they live in San Francisco, good for them.  They won the Superbowl a long time ago and they belong in the NFL.  I think they won the superbowl in 2016.
San Francisco sounds like a great team, many cities have teams there, I wonder why not more cities have Teams there,
The Patriots, they have won five championships.
I guess everybody admires the one who won the most championships, but I wonder how many championships they have won. I don't know if I know their prowess or not.
Well I'm not familiar with Tom Brady, are you?
I heard his name is a special thing, I don't really know him.
It stands for quarterback.  QB stands for Quarterback.  Quarterbacks are leaders of offensive teams.
Yes, I guess so, a leader. He's good at championing his team. I guess he was the quarterback of the Patriots.
Tim Brady is like a team quarterback? I don't know what that means, do you know?
I think Tim has a special talent, Tom does too. It's hard to share leadership with your brothers. Tim has his own special talent.
Oh my, sorry for the typo, what I meant was Tom Brady is the quarterback who lead the team to the Superbowl championships, not the quarterback with the most superbowl championships,
Tim Bradys sounds like he was teaching us so many things about the game of NFL and the teams and Tom is a great example of courage and leadership.  He is the best example of what american sports should be about - teaching us to appreciate the best in our teams & teams, and the game.
Thank you too. I have to run now. It was nice chatting with you!
Same here, I've got to run.
I read that on the internet, it was a typo that the quarterback of the Patriots is Tom Brady.  The only quarterback in the NFL, I think.  Sorry.  Bye.
Are you a Tom Brady fan?
Yes! I saw a documentary on "Tom vs Time", it was Tom vs Time. I admire his hard working skills, commitment to the team and sport and want to learn more from his commitment.
No, I haven't, but it sounds interesting. Apparently football is like a religion to him, I wonder if he believes in it?
Football is a religion and a religion is a worship.  Bill We Trust is a Patriot Coach, he is an extreme example of this.  Tom Brady is a patriot, he follows creed and the Bill We trust.
Yeah, and the fact that he and his fans have deemed him "the messiah."
that is crazy, did you hear how the Saints cheerleaders are treated?
Yeah,  that is pretty sexist and outside of the confines of fraternization.  It is pretty sexism.
Yeah.  Women are allowed to play in the NFL but I have never heard anybody coming close to joining the league, at least at this time in my time, so I wonder when they will.
No, that seems really sexist I hope they do form a league like the WNBA, one thing I would not want to do is a linebacker, that is a 50 pound, 6'7", 220 pound QB who can hit like no other, I would like to form a leagues just to get away from that.
I understand that the physical requirements that they must meet in order to play and even survive an attack by a 295 pound linebacker are something that a wnfl player would not meet.  I think that it's an intensive sport with so many physical requirements and the wnFL is quite different compared to nfl.  It's definitely a sport with more physical requirements to meet, especially compared to NFL.
I agree, women being smart enough to stay away from it because there are brain injuries and such.  I don't think there is a WNBA, so it's not going to go anywhere.
Yeah, it is not worth the risk.  I would devote my entire Sunday to that sport, even if it is only eleven minutes of live gameplay.  If I had to devote my ENTIRE Sunday to a sport that has eleven minutes  of live play, I would do so.
Go figures. I would rather have avocado ice cream and not a game.
yeah, avocado ice-cream is a big thing now, I have tried a poke and it is okay, but I don't like it, what about you?
Poke? Apparently Tom Brady swears by it. He said it's part of his "method program."
Oh wow I didn't know it was called Poke, I think that's a sushi thing? I'm from Hawaii, so maybe he did a diet regimen and used it for a sushi Thing, but I don't know.
Yes, the joy of his life. Peak performances and plenty of avocado ice cream. It's all part of his plan for a better life.
Wow, that's a book I will have to look up. I wonder if avocado prices increased as a result of that by any chance?
I can't say that I do, but I gather that the highest scoring football game of the 1930s was a college game.  I wonder how they got it up to 222 to 0.  It was a high scoring football games.
I didn't know that! I wonder what the score was? I would think a game of that high would not even be possible to score that high!
Georgia Tech put a hurting on Cumberland 220-0.
Wow, I wonder if the losing team got any pride, or if they were bruised and couldn't score any points. I would think that the losingteam would take some pride.
hi, do you like football?
Yeah football is pretty cool and fun to watch, I think it's a way to make a religion, you know?
Did you watch the superbowl?
I did!  I watched the first Super Bowl LI and the Falcons, and the Patriots won.  The second was the Super Bowl LII, where the Patriots lost to the Falcons.
Are you a Patriots fan?  Who's your favorite team?
I like the Patriots!  It's a bit strange that after Brady decided to start a religion based on football, though.
I agree. I think the Pats are still the home team. In the 60's bowlers made twice as much as top NFL players.
I had no idea that bowlers made that much money! Wow I wonder why. I know there is money in the money, litterally in the record books, did you hear about the football game that ended 222-0 in 1916?
Wow that's amazing! Did you know that ESPN won an emmy for creating the yellow first down line?
Yeah that is an interesting thing to win an Emmy for.  I think it is an really interesting thing, especially since there is only 11 minutes of gameplay in a football game.  It counts the time that the ball is moving when the ball counts as the 11 minutes.  So, it is like the ball are moving while the ball has only been moving for a few minutes ofGameplay.
Wow that's incredible. I know that in a game that takes 3 hours for 11 minutes of game play and yet there is only 11 minutes in 3 hours of play.
Yeah, and yeah, the NFL has all kinds of wacky rules.  The Saints have a weird one where their cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as an NFL player.  Weird, huh?
That is bizarre and sexist.  I wonder why that is.  The university of Iowa's locker room for the visiting team is painted all pink.  Do you know why?  The visiting team's locker Room for the university of iowa's team is paint all pink?
I wonder how they try to demoralize the opposing team.  That's a tough color.  It's a macho sport so it's a very tough color to attempt.  I also think it's weird that the NFL has tracking chips to record the players on and off the field.  Maybe they use them to record players on the field?
I agree that could be demoralizing, but I don't think it would make the requirements for the NFL more likely to make the Requirements.  There is no rule against women playing in the NFL, so I don's see why they would have a rule against Women playing.
Yeah, I believe they are technically allowed to play if the requirements are met.  I'm not sure how the requirements would be met though, but I'm guessing they would have to include something in the bill we trust you to know.  Hahaha.  Do you think they will play for the Patriots?  They made an NFL team in 1946 and they include the only woman to have made an nfl team!
Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled.
I did not know that, that's pretty impressive, I wonder why he has never fumbled, he has played that long a in his career and he has not fumbled once!
I enjoy watching the game with the Patriots. I like the old stuff. Supposedly Tom Brady hasn't eaten a strawberry since 2007! I think that's weird. What people do not know is that supposedly Tom Brady has never eaten a Strawberry.
That's pretty strange. Wow, that shows the divide between the celebrities and the regular people. Tom Brady is a celebrity, but a random person can use any method to sell you something, and that is pretty strange, I wonder if he wrote about it on the internet or some random person, it just shows how far celebrities have come and how much they are used to selling themselves and their method to regular people, it really shows the Divide.
I don't care about celebrities,they are people and not what they wrote.  But people like to call that a book.  They do not care about the Bible how distasteful it is.  I wonder if someone wrote it and then used it as a book?
Yeah, I don't like him either, but hey people are just people.  I don' t hate him.  Brady is just famous.
Yes, in any case it's crazy the lengths some people will go to, and in my case it crazy the depths some people go to to idolize celebs. I like celebrities because they're people,some are good athletes or actors, some are not.
Yeah, I know, people always have crazy things to praise celebrities for and then look back and say that they did crazy things, but they can talk about anything and people will still praise it.
Sounds good.  Take care.
okay, I'm alright.
Hi!  Are you a fan of the NFL?
Yes, I enjoy the heart and soul of the divine game.
I love the game too.  Do you have a favorite team or player?
I'm a patriots fan true and blue, it's my religion.
Yeah I love the Patriots and Brady, I think there is a book out by an author, I wonder who the author is
I did not. I did not know that until recently. I understand that there are some people who think Tom Brady is the kind of messiah, which makes sense, he is charismatic.
Yeah he sure has made a career of it. Did you know women can play in the NFL too?
No, I did not. That's interesting. I never realized that before. I wonder if they'll have a tough time meeting the eligibility requirements though. They track players movements with chips. I'm sure they can track them.
Yeah, they are collecting stats like velocity and rotation, I hope they can use the data to make thegame safer, they can do that.
Yeah, it is better to be safe than sorry. football should be paid for as entertainment and not as entertainment as it is now. I would take the money and do something else.
I think it is, but with all the concussions, I don't know.  I know in the 60s bowlers made more money than football players.  Can you spare me a few?  Bowlers made so much money.
Wow, I suppose it is because the average time is short actually playing in the NFL. I know the average game is over 3 hours but the average average time of an engineer is only 1 minute and 17 seconds. In the long run an engineer would be able to make just as much as an engineer. I suppose in the longrun it is not as safe as bowling, but it is as safe to make as the NFL is.
I think that would work out well but I think bowling would still be a pretty slow game. Did you hear about the game between Georgia Tech and Cumberland back in 1916?
I did, 222-0! That's insane. That kind of stats is what makes me interested in football. What kind of Stats did Green-Ellis have? He never fumbled.
Yeah the guy is a legend, did you know ESPN won an emmy for the yellow line they used for the first yellow line?
Wow, I guess it has a place in football, but winning an Emmy for something that is so much more than just a line?  It's like winning an emmy for a bible with only 11 minutes of gameplay.  That kind of exposure is probably why football has that kind of Exposure.
I honestly cannot make a relation between that and football. On the other hand it is the best selling book of all time, with over 4 billion copies sold.
That is crazy, good advice. I wonder who came up with the Jefferson version of it? I know it was the Jefferson's version of a deal with the best part of football.
Yeah the guy who did all that supernatural stuff, wow, I wonder how he cut himself with that razor, I don't know if he cut it with a razor.
I mean that is insane. But he founded a great university so I suppose he could not have been successful without God by his side. I wonder if Brady would have been as successful without him, I suppose if there was no God in the corner he could never have founded a GREAT University like he did, I wonder what he would have done.
I guess so. Roosevelt and Quincy were so religious that they passed on swearing in with a bible. I guess they were not religious enough.
I suppose that's the logic of it. You're not asked to swear or affirm, so why do you need to?
Yeah I like that option.  Well it was a nice chat.  Have a good one.
Are you familiar with football?
Yes, I watch it sometimes, but I don't keep up with it.
I have a passing knowledge of it, but not much.
The NFL has no written rule against female players. Women are allowed to play if they met the league's eligibility requirements. There are no written rules against women playing in the NFL.
What do you mean those requirements don't inherently disqualify women?  Do you know what those requirements are?
That's true, but I don't think the requirements are so much that women could play non-contact positions.
I wonder how much of the positions risk contact.
Kickers and punters have limited risk because there is no way to tackle.
True.  I guess that is a liability.
I don't see anyone advocating that women. play. In fact, engineers are better than women. The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an NFL player.
I wonder if that is due to injury related early retirement or something else.
True. Did you know engineers have fewer concussions than others?
I didn't know that.
True.  Engineers are not content with pink locker rooms.  They want their clothing to have tracking chips in it like engineers.
I don't know what they do with that data.  I know they are using it in the NFL though.
I'm sure it sells them to spy agencies in North Korea, or to training coaches.
lol, I hope so.  I hope it helps to lower the rate of physical injuries and concussions.
I think tracking is really good for video game design.  The players really move around, so the model is very good for Video Game design.
I wonder how gaming companies are going to do that? I know they don't make football games.
I understand that they can use data, I think it is interesting that they attached sensors to bowlers back when they bowled, they were not superstars so there was no data, they just bowled.
LOL, very true. I guess it is possible. In any case, thanks for chatting.  In any event, I will go now.  I guess I will have to get off here.  Have a nice day.
Are you a football fan?
I am! I like american football and the round ball. Do you?
Football. The Patriots just won the Super Bowl. Tom Brady is the best QB ever.
Yes, Tom Brady is a pretty good coach for the patriots. I guess he is also a pretty pretty good QB.
Yes he is the quarterback and he led his team to the super bowl.
Good for him.  He plays for the Patriots in New York and also plays for New York.
I think they are in New England. Hey, did you know that in the 1960's a top bowler made twice as much as top NFL players?
I am not surprised. Bowling is a difficult and dangerous sport. I expect that bowlers take a risk and are compensated for that risk. I would expect thatbowlers would be compensated well.
I forgot the floor is pretty slippery.  I wonder if they have a locker room painted pink for the visiting coach.  Iowa State's coach has the visiting locker room painting pink! lol
Iowa is a pretty pink state in general, so I guess it's a pretty Pink state in the US to raise awareness of breast cancer
I think it is, pretty much a psychological strategy. They are putting tracking chips inside the footballs.
I think I have seen Iowa put tracking chips on the footballs. I don't know if that's cheating or not.  I think it's just to get an advantage.
I meant the NFL,  putting tracking chips in the shoulder pads,  and the footballs, lol  I wonder if they did so with the shoulder pad or the football itself?
I guess the NFL is worried about lost footballs being tracked. I thought they would be pretty easy to get tracked. But I guess they thought the players would be a bit more willing to do it.
I think they record a players movements, velocity, rotation and ball speed, velocity on the field, and record a player's movements on the ball.
That's not good for their privacy.  lol  I guess it can't be worse than Facebook.  I mean, the players can't use that data for any kinds of strategizing, so who knows.  But, the data can't really be worsethan Facebook...except for privacy.
Yeah apparently Tom Brady has a thing for avocado ice cream
Avocado ice cream?  That sounds awful!  I wonder if it is natural, natural or something else.  I think strawberry is the only natural, and I don't think his coach likes it.
The Patriots also produce one of the best quarterback in the history of football - the quarterback who has never fumbled the ball in his career!
That is full of surprises.  I think he was a receiver and not a QB.  If he was, I don't know if he was supposed to fumble the ball.  The coach should have let him go.  He was a QB and not supposed to have a full back.
Yes, the running back runs the ball to the end zone and the QB runs the back to the goal line.  Making sure that the runningback is not fumbling it in the endzone.  Good chat!
Hi there.  Do you watch football at all?
Hi there I am familiar with it, but not really a big fan. My bro had a football scholarship in college so I am a big big fan, are you?
Nice!  He got a sweet deal.  He went to Iowa and got his chance.
He did choose U of Arkansas to attend, I think he went to Iowa, but I can't remember the exact date, but it was back in the mid nineties, so he was in Iowa in the early nineties. I think that was back when he was a senior in HS, if I remember the exactly date right.
I did not. I am wondering why the visitor locker room for the visiting team is painted pink.
Yeah, I heard that.  I've heard that before.  It's kind of funny, I read about an experiment where they painted a lifting room pink and found out that lighters were suddenly used to weight down their opponents.  Guess Iowa has the same experiment going on.  They have a weight room that is painted pink too, but they found that the lighters suddenly did not weight as much as the opponents!  Hehe!
Nice, that explains the reasoning, and the highest score in football history is 222 to 0, that is the highestscore in football ever, how about that!
I do not, but I know that the team was not that good, and the opponents were getting beat pretty badly by the other team.
Yeah, I bet they did, but I bet it was Georgia Tech that beat Cumberland, I think that was bragging rights for the day.
LOL.  ESPN won an Emmy for creating the yellow graphics representing the " yellow first down" representing the first down in football games.  It's amazing.  I like the old graphics they did of Joe Montana narrating the game.
Yeah go figure.  Things have moved along pretty fast since then.  Do you know Benjarvus Green-Ellis?
I am assuming that he is a football player, right?  Shrugs, no, who is he?
Yeah, and he never fumbled the ball in his career, he never even fumbled once in his whole career.
That is pretty amazing! Crazy to think that as long as games only have 11 minutes of live game play!
I know right, that is mind blowing, how long do you think we are glued to the tv for for so long
I think it's neat how closely we know the game. I guess they use chips in the shoulder pads of the players and inside the footballs as well to track speed rotation to keep up with the game, and I guess it's all recorded through those chips in their shoulder pads as well.
Yeah, I hope they use the stats to make the game safer.  That is pretty cool.  Did you hear of the rule about New Orleans cheerleaders?  They have a rule that they can't be more than 18, and yeah, that is pretty crazy.  I wonder if they use those stats to help the game.
Yes, I did. What is that?
The players were not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players.
Wow, that is pretty strict.  I guess it is for the players to stay away from fraternizing with them.  LOL.  That rule must be pretty strict, I wonder if there are any young cheerleaders who are attractive enough for the Players to stay there.  They have to be big for that rule.  Can you imagine how big they would have to get to get around that rule?  LOL
Yeah I guess so.  What an odd rule.
Are you a football fan?
I love football. Did you know female players are allowed if they met eligibility requirements?
I wonder if there will be a female kicker someday?  I wonder if it will have to meet eligibility requirements, though.
That would be awesome.  I think New Orleans will do something about it, they should do it a few times and give their cheerleaders normal rights like players.  They don't make them subserviant to the players at all times and giving them rights like that would not go over well.
Absolutely, but making a Saints cheerleader leave a restaurant if a saints player is there is illegal. It's foolish and they should be made to leave if they are making a saints cheerleaderleave, but that's about it.
Right? It should be illegal.  In the 1960s bowlers made twice as much as football players.
Wow!  Hard to believe, I'm guessing TV revenue changed that quickly.
Speaking of tv, did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the yellow line they superimposed on the first down line?
I did not know about the Emmy. It was very well deserved. I can't imagine watching football without that yellow line telling us what happens after the first down. It makes football more exciting to see the player stretch and reach for the line telling you if they've got it. The yellow line makes it so much more exciting when you can see the play and see the game going on with the line.
I love the yellow line too! Did you know they have tracking chips in their shoulder pads? I feel like they should use the tracking chips that are in our shoulder pads!
I guess I don't know.  I know they use tracking chips for so much information now.  It doesn't make any sense to me that they can track a straight line, but I guess it would make sense to keep the top speed and total distance traveled.  The running backs would need to know the top and bottom speed and the total distance travel.
It seems so techy for a sport that uses footballs.  I wonder what the chips do for the footballs?
I wonder if they rely too much on the chips if eventually they are going to rely too many on them. I know that a player broke the plane of the refs when he had the ball in the end zone and scored in the 90's. He got it in the corner of the end Zone and scored.
I wonder what all the chips are supposed to do. The chips are suppose to tell us about ball speed, rotation, rotation of the ball, location, velocity, location and other info.
That is interesting. I wonder if that information is ever relayed in real time. It would be neat to see it. Like when the chip broke the end zone lights surrounding the endzone and the flash of the chip was so interesting to see. It was cheesy, but it was interesting to get the information from the lights surrounding it. It must have been neat to watch when theChip broke the End Zone lights!
That would be cheesy.  It's like how Tom Brady is so much alike to hockey.
I think Brady is incredible!  I was going to say no but I am changing my mind because he has a complete obsession with football.  He can't balance his family life with his play so he has to balance everything.
Brady is a kind of messiah figure to a lot of Patriots fans.  He's full of himself and wants to win so much.  I think he's some kind ofmessiah figure who wants to be the best.
I don't blame them. I agree that Pats have a messiah figure at this point. But I think there are some lessons we can learn from Brady and his faith. I know there's a pastor in Virginia who believes that there's actually a lot we canlearn from Brady. There's a lot more to football than skill and obsession with the point, but it's not just about the skill, I think. It's about faith and faith in the NFL.
I agree, I think he has the obsession but he has been doing this his whole life for football, he should just give it up and give up the obsession,
True, I have found it to be hard to believe that his family life revolves around football. His supermodel wife and kids is portrayed as perfect but I don't think his whole family life focuses around football and he is not. His family life around his wife and children is portrayed in a different way.
I completely agree,  and I'm sure he has a very happy family lol  It was nice chatting with you,  have a nice one!
Are you a fan of the NFL? I enjoy the NFL.
I'm not a big fan, but I watch it sometimes when my son is little and I watch with him, and my entire family enjoy NFL games.
Glad to hear it.  Are you a Bears fan?  I have a family rooting for one of the other teams so I have my family rooting against the other.
I live in the San Francisco, so they are in the SF.
That makes sense.  Are you familiar with the Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis?  I'm not familiar with him.
Yes, I had heard of him.  He never fumbled the ball in his NFL career.
That's very impressive!  I hear that he was in the University of Iowa's locker room and even the visiting locker room.
I did not know that! They painted the locker room for visiting teams pink? That must intimidate them, I wonder why?
I am assuming it is some kind of mind game. I don't know.
I think so. DO you like Tom Brady?
I'm not a fan.
I do admire it.  I remember when he was winning five championship.
He wrote a book about it too.  It was really good,  I hear he was good at one point,  he got a lot of help.
I didn't know that! What did he do for it?
He wrote a book called "the method" and he referred to it as the Athlete's Bible, it's referred to as the "Athlete's bible"
What kind of book is that?
I suppose it depends on where you look at it, some critic called it cult, some call it spiritual, others creepy. I suppose it's depends on how you consider spiritual, but one critic calledIt cult.
I think he is trying to help others.
I have not read it to make that judgement.  On another topic, did you know that ESPN won an Emmy for creating the yellow line that represents the first down line?
I heard about that, the yellow line, it seems like a good idea for american football.
It definitely was. I think it deserved that Emmy. I can't imagine watching without it. I would have completely lost it. That was an amazing idea. It deserved that emmy.
Me too!  I did watch the superbowl this year!
I did not.  It was horrible.  I wish I could have seen it.
hi how are you? do you watch the nfl?
I do, once or twice a week, how about you?
Nice, I watch it sometimes.  I like the teams that I watch.  Do you watch any?
Yeah I do not know how many teams arent there, only 32 teams actually
yup, I know that. Did you know U of Iowa painted their visitor locker room pink?
No doubt, I wonder if it has an effect on the other team or the team itself.
Yeah maybe it had no effect at all. I can't believe that bowlers used to make twice as much as football players. Wow, wow, I can only think of a few bowlers.
Yeah, that is crazy, the average players make a lot more today than the stars did back then. Football has so much money now, but the stars make a whole lot more than the average.
That is true but also engineers make more in a lifetime, they make more than them
I heard that.  ESPN actually won an Emmy for that yellow line they superimpose on the screen to show the first down line they's superimposes.
Yeah, I guess it helps a lot with watching the game. Strange but good.
It is pretty simple but genius from a perspective. It give us fans something to look at and something to do. Pretty simple but Genius.
Yeah, and it's the highest score in the history of football!
Huh? yein, Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0? I bet they didnt even get to play for awhile, huh?
I bet, Georgia Tech had an amazing win that was for bragging rights that day, I bet, and that was an amazing way to do it. I wonder how much bragging rights they got after that.
I think a bit of a bit to much for that team and still to this day.  I didnt know that one could perfect every play to sore 100 points.  You would think they would have to perfect every game.  They were the better team.
Yeah, you're right.  Did you hear about the tracking chips that they use for the player's?  Do you know how many players have them?
Yeah and they even have them inside the footballs and the shoulder pads and also the shoulder pad
Yeah and they are also tracking velocity and rotation, they can use that data to make the game safer
Oh that would be cool.  Hope they can use that information better soon.  These days everything is being done with information now.
Well I got to go, nice chatting with you
Are you a football fan?
I am a football fan, although I prefer the American football over the soccer.  Did you know they call it "football" in other countries when referring to soccer?
I am not a soccer fan, but I follow some football. I have heard of the method.
I do not know what it stands for. Do you like Tom Brady?
I believe the number 12 is the number of the Patriots.  He wears it for the Patriots right?
That makes total sense, what is the best method?
I'm not sure, maybe it's a religion? Patriots fans like to think of Tom as some sort of messiah, like some sortOf messiah.
I can't imagine it.  Lots of die-hard fans.  Tom vs Time has even garnered a "tom vs time" documentary.  I wonder if they will release a second one.
No, I haven't seen it. What is it about?
I have not, I just use Facebook as a social media platform. Did you know that it premiered on Facebook Watch in 2007 and is a function of the social media site?
Occasionally, it strikes my interest while browsing, but I don't use it often.
I'm interested in watching that docuseries, not to mention that there is one about a former Patriots player that I would be interested in watch, too. I saw that Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the football in his career, impressive!
I hope they end up paying him!  I think that was impressive.  Bowlers used to be made twice as much amount as pro football players in the 1960s, and I hope they'll end up making the same amount as Pro football players now.
Yeah, it is a bad thing they paid so much to football players when there is only eleven minutes of live game play. Engineers, on the other hand, don't make that much, and engineers only make more than football players. I think it is also a bad idea to play football, but it is the only thing they have, so yeah, it's a bad things they paid them.
I know right!  I love that they can play 11 minutes a week and make millions but I don't realize that they have to work for that much work,  and then they are playing 11 minutes of stuff for about 2 minutes a year and still get to work.  Kinda crazy.  They don't have to do that but they make millions and still work!  Kind of crazy.
Yes it is, even with such a high salary, the NFL has to enforce rules like making cheerleaders leave a restaurant if an NFL player walks in, and the NFL player has to be able to enforce rule that a cheerleader has to leave a food restaurant if a NFL player comes in.  So much ego.
I think it does. The rule is there for ego, but it doesn't seem like a logical reason to have such a rule for any other reason.
I think that rule should be amended, making them leave fuels their ego, it sheds a really bad light on the team imo, I think that should be amendments to that rule, making someone leave fuels the ego of the team Imo,
I think the NFL doesn't like to treat women well, and there are no physical requirements, so I can see females wanting to play. I wonder how they would treat women if they did have the physical requirements.
I think proving themselves would be a big factor in whether female NFL players gear up, and money would also be a factor. I can imagine the physical requirements to withstand the impact of a 250 pound linebacker is something female NFL Players would have to meet. I think the money would be another big factor.
Personally I dont know, they probably use a lot of bubble wrap, so I don't think they would need anything different.
lol  I would want to have a sumo suit with extra padding on top of it.  That would be better.
Hey Friend!  How are you?
Hello there, are you a fan of the NFL?
Yes I love watching the NFL. It's my religion. What about you?
Nice, I watch it as well. Did you know women can play too?
Yes, I did.  Is any woman that good?
I don't know but I know Jtey can go over 90 minutes in a game.
Interesting. Do you like religion? The NFL is a religion?
I do like the NFL.  I like that there are 32 teams!
I know that there are 32 total teams and that the 32 are in the US and the other 30 in the NFL. Who is your favorite NFL team?
Bejarvus and the Patriots, do you like them?
I do not, but I like the Patriots. They have a running back that is my favorite. Tom Brady is the savior for the Patriots, he is the best.
Nice, great player!  I wonder if he uses tracking chips?
I did not know that, do you know how they work?
They put in a bunch of different stats. Tract velocity and rotation, etc. They put in some padding for the tract velocity and rotate.
That is crazy technology, I wonder why it wasn't developed sooner, with engineers making more money when they developed it.
I know.  I know that ESPN won an emmy.  Do you know why?
Yes, I heard that was for the yellow line for the first yellow line.
Yeah I guess that deserves an award, did you know that bowlers used to make more money than football players in the 60s?
I never knew that. I bet they didn't do that now! It was nice chatting with you.
Yeah the football players do not make more money now, so they need to make more. Nice chat.
Good bye. Good bye!
good bye, bye! :)
Hello, do you watch the NFL?
I do. I am shocked that there are only 11 minutes of actually live gameplay in the whole 3 hours of game, only 11 of them being live gameplay
Yeah, that's pretty crazy. Who's your favorite player or team?
I don't have a favorite team, my favorite team is the Green Bay Packers, what about you?
I like the Patriots and Tom Brady. What do you think of him as a player?
I'm a fan of Tom Brady. He's often compared to a messiah figure.  He's not cocky, but he does seem to be a little too cocky.
Yeah I don't find him to be one either, but I guess he is a writer so maybe he can find a way to be different.
I believe he is a bit of an actor too.  Apparently he is going to be doing a documentary, "Tom vs Time"  which will be a bit like a Tom vs Time: The Last Tom.
Yeah that is true, did you know women can actually play in the NFL?  I wonder if women are able to?  Can they play?
Yes. I think I would love to see that. I would like to see one play in college, or the NFL. Maybe the University of Iowa. Their is a pink visiting team locker room. I wonder if that is the same as the pink visitingTeam locker room in the NFL?
I don't know if it works.  I think it is meant to be sort of a distraction for the oppposing team, sort of like a distraction to the other team?
I think Cumberland was very distracted in 1916 when they lost to Georgia Tech 222-0
I bet a lot of them were.  That is the highest in the history of the sport for a high school.  I think it was for high school only.
I feel bad for Cumberland, but I have faith in the Georgia Tech player who was going to beat them. They are not Brady. I feel bad about the Georgia tech player.
Yeah interesting point.  On another topic what do you think about the bible?
A little bit.  Did you know that Jefferson created his own version of the bible, a version of it, that was different from the one we have?
I did not know that, I wonder if he used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts of it
Yes, I bet kids in elementary school still use the bible. I betkids in private schools also use to read from it.
Yeah, I'm glad that rule doesn't apply anymore. I think Catholicism is a choice for the catholic schools and I think religion is a right, glad that's a choice that doesn'tapply anymore.
I agree.  Apparently, Roosevelt and Adams were the only two president who did not swear in with a bible.  I wonder how they could swear in without a bible?
Yeah, some people think that the tower of babel still exists, do you think that it actually still does?
That's awesome! I heard it is in Iraq, maybe Iraq is where it is.  Nice chatting with you!
Are you a fan of football?
I watch NFL games sometimes. How about you?
I cut cable a long time ago, so only see it for the superbowl. You?
I read an article that NFL has no rules against female players. I'm surprised. There are no rulesagainst female players in the US, right?
Ive never seen a female on the field.
I've seen female players, if I'm not mistaken, but no female referee.  If I were interested in joining I would be interested in becoming a female referee, I wonder if there are any female players that would be more interested?
That is correct, there is a female referee. I have not heard of her, though. I hope they treat cheerleaders well. I would hope they'd treat cheerleader well, too.
I heard that there is a rule that New Orleans cheerleaders have to follow but I wonder if they follow it? Is there a rule about that?
Yeah they have to leave a restaurant if a player walks in or comes into the place.  If they eat there they have not to eat there if a game is going on and they have been there already.
Yes, and they have to stay in the restaurant if the players are in it, they have not to leave if the cheerleaders are in the same restaurant, but if the player comes in the cheerleader has to leave.
Apparently they have to, what happened to necessitate that rule?
It was mentioned that the media could have influence with the New Orleans team to change this odd rule.
I'm sure the Saints are the only one, it's just crazy that it's a league wide rule and not applicable to just the Saints. I wonder if it's actually a leaguewide rule?
I admire Tom Brady for sure.
I think he is a fantastic athlete, I can buy into his stuff.
I have never seen the stuff mentioned in his Facebook watch program.
No, I'm not sure.  That would be interesting though.
I will have to watch that Facebook Watch program, it will be aired on Jan 16th, this year, it is on Facebook Watch.
Ill have to look that up, I heard it is a Tom Vs Time episode, I've never seen that one, have you?
I did not know that!  I wonder why that is, do you know?
I havent, I think it is about him giving up his life to play football,
Sounds like football is a religion.  Anyway, I've got to run.  I enjoyed the chat!
hey there!  Do you read the bible?
I have read it as a kid but not as a religious person, but I read the sacred book as a book when I was a kid.  I still read the Sacred Book when I can.
It was a best selling book of all time in 1965 and in school it was required to read it all the time, but they were strictly disciplined like students.
I guess there are a lot of religious persons that like the Bible.  Did you know that Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible?
Yeah that is impressive improvising.
He also believes in miracles and resurrections in the Bible, I guess he doesnt believe in the part about the miracles and resurrected,
That seems reasonable.  He seems to be more into factual and real things.  The Tower of Babel is actually based on an actual building not on a Bible.  Seems promising that there is something so real.  And that the Tower of Babylon is actually a real building, and based on a factual andReal thing.
I didnt know that, the tower of Babel is a great story and I read that story when I was a child but I didnt know it was the Tower of Babel, I think that it is a really great story.
Yeah, it was interesting to me how different different perspectives on the Bible come from differing perspectives on it. It's the canonical text of the Bible, but from differing viewpoints it's still the canonical book!
The bible has been estimated sales over 5 billion copies worldwide with 1 billion copies of the estimated sales.
Personally, I would make a book about it.  I can't imagine it would be as successful as that.
I'm not a big fan of the science in that book. I think parts of it are wrong and proven so many times that I think things are just mistaken, if I'm not mistaken. I don't know what to think of science in the book.
I like the point about not taking things with a grain of salt and just taking it with agrain of salt at that.  I think that the wisdom of others is derived from the actions of Thomas Jefferson and not just his own wisdom.
Thomas Jefferson was a wise man, the Bible makes sense, taking the supernatural parts of the book of the Bible, miracles, and such, and taking the Supernatural parts seriously, I think the book provides valuable lessons for everyone, Thomas Jefferson was certainly a wise person,
I can't swear by it but I know Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams were nonconforming in their choosing to use the Bible.  Roosevelt and Adams werenonconforming because they swear in using the bible.
That's very interesting. I guess not all presidents are religious but it is very interesting when they are public. Did you know the fruit apple was the first fruit to be given to the US President?
Yeah thats a surprising fact, another surprising fact is that the bible was translated into several different languages, like it was not even known how it got that name
Yeah, the whole apple and evil characters from the Malus thing I guess, meaning both the apple and good characters have their own meaning.
Yeah, the history of the apple is very complex and I never thought of it like that.  I always thought it was just an apple.
I agree and I agree with you, the word "apocrypha" has a different meaning than what we think of as apple.  I heard it means something different, apple no clue what that means, but the meaning is probably apocrypha.
Yeah, it's a difference of opinion.
Yeah various levels of respect and disagreement, good thing reading the bible is not a mandatory thing for an elementary education, everyone is free to chose their own religion but I think its probably a good thing, elementary education is a good way to go about it, and yeah various levels, but reading the Bible is still a free to choose and not a Mandatory thing,
Hello, do you enjoy sports?
Football is my favorite and I do report that I like Tom Brady, although I do not know much about his religion or if he is a favorite, but I know that Tom Brady is one of the best, do you like football?
I like the Patriots, too. Do you like them?
There are a couple of cases of cheating in the NFL this century, but Tom Brady is beating everyone out of class. He has a couple, and there are a few others who are playing longer than him, but with Tom Brady and QB Gotham Chopra, the series is over, even with a couple more cases of cheat.
He is one of the lanisters of football
That's a great analogy! Chopra makes that point. It's easier for strangers to talk about sports than about religion.
Religion can be a controversial or touchy topic for sure.
I know. No doubt about that. Bill we trust him as a coach and has confidence in his faith.
Yes, trusting the coach is essential, they cannot make a mistake while hesitating.
That's true, and it carries over to the players, players, and the fans.  There is only one coach in history that has won more play-off games than he has won in the play-offs.
Do you have a favorite team or player?
I'm an Oklahoma University fan. I enjoyed seeing Baker Mayfield in the NFL in the Cleveland, Cleveland. I like the Cleveland Browns of all teams.
Did you see him in the superbowl?
They made the play-offs and then went 0-16 last year and were happy to win some regular season games. I think that some teams just aren't talented enough to make the playoffs. Some of the players are too young and not talented. I am sure the players would be happy to play for their teams if they could.
That sounds great! They have improved by leaps and bounds.
Yes they have.  Did you know that the yellow line is the one that shows the line to gain on a gain?
I have. I like it, I think ESPN is the only one that does it, right?
ESPN received an Emmy for it.  It adds a lot to the viewing pleasure of everyone.
It helps the audience digest it more easily, so they can get more action in the action.
I think so. The NFL also puts tracking chips in the footballs to measure velocity and rate of spin to help compare QBs. I wonder if they have data that can be used to compare QB to QB?
I hope so! I think they can use that to reduce injuries too.
They could use the pads to keep injuries down too. Nice chatting with you.
Hi, do you watch the NFL?
Yes I enjoy watching NFL. I particularly enjoy watching nfl quarterback Tom Brady.
Nice.  Good player, good book writer.
I did not know that, I wonder what part he is in there, maybe part of his Method I heard he uses, what do you think?
Yeah, it is. Did you know women can play in the NFL?
I did not know that.  That's impressive.  I wonder if the New Orleans Saints rules on women cheerleaders and players will be the same?  They don't allow women cheerleading?
Yeah, pretty sexist. They can't even eat in the same restaurant? What do you mean?
Yes it is. Did you know the average NFL game only has eleven minutes of action?
That is pretty short, pretty crazy to be honest, I think it won an Emmy, but I do like how it won ESPN won
I heard that they did. I think they did it for the yellow line that was a big change for broadcast football.
It sure was, it makes it easier for those watching the game at home.
Yes it does.  Do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was?  Do they know if technology existed before or after the highestscoring football game?
yeah, 222-0 Georgia tech...
I wonder what they accomplished. I wonder what the university of iowa did to get the pink locker rooms, they have pink locker room.
Hmm, I don't know.  Bowlers used to make more in the 60s than football players.  Do you know why?
No I didn't know that.  But today, an engineer will earn more lifetime than most professional atheletes and an engineer, even an engineerwill earn more Lifetime than some professional athelete.
Yeah I guess the fact that their careers tend to be short and they make less in money, but yeah I guess they still make more, money is always money
I like combining the two topics and the NFL is doing it again by hiring engineers for chips to embed in equipment.
Yeah they are, I think they track velocity and rotation and such.  I hope they can do that to make the game safer, or at least safer for the player.
True. Did you know that Thomas Jefferson once said there were "supernatural" things that are called "superstitute" things? I always thought it was just a thought but it was disliked by him and called "the supernatural"
Yeah, he did not like the resurrection and miracles so cut them with a razor.
I wonder how he cut them off?
I think he used parts of his own version of the actual Bible and then a different version of it in other parts
Interesting. Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams were the two presidents who did not use a Bible when they were sworn in and sworn in.
Yeah, I have a feeling he did not.
Do you watch the NFL?
I watch around playoff times. I like Tom Brady. He's so dominant.
Yeah, he is one of the best players ever. There is a book by the author of the book, about him.
Yeah, he does, it is called the athlete's bible.
Yeah, the athelete's bible.
I don't know how people can get behind the Patriots. I think some of them are fans of a sort of messiah and some of the people are not.
Yeah, I think I heard about that.  Do you know who Benajrvus is?
Yeah the same guy, and he didn't fumble the ball once, which is a pretty incredible feat for a QB
Yes it is. Bowlers used to make more than football players in the 1960's, more so than football and bowlers in the 60's, but they only make $7,000 per career.
That's surprising.  I know engineers make more in their lifetime than football players but I think that's because engineers make so much more because they work hard in school.  They have more incentive to work hard, and bowling was less popular.  But it's still more popular, so they make more over the lifetime than Football players.
Yup, I guess their careers are longer and they deserve more time to make money, they deserve it.
That is true, football has been going on for so long, Tom Brady and other stars dont have to do it as long. It is hard on their body though.
Yeah it can. Did you know ESPN won an emmy?
Yeah, the yellow line that they used for the yellow lines, it wasnt until 2007, wasnt it a pretty neat invention, makes viewing at home a lot easier
Yeah it sure does do a lot for us.Do you know what the highest score ever was for a game?
I think that was between tech and cumberland, 222-0.
Yes.  That was a game that was off topic but I do not think it was in the Bible.
I know some interesting facts, like the word apple comes from the latin malus which means evil, and the word Apple means both good and evil
Interesting.  Did you know Jefferson created his own version of the bible?  It is a different version of what we know from the Bible.
Yeah, kind of crazy. He did it with a razor, and a razor at that.
Yeah, it does. I guess if I was a believer, I would cut off the supernatural part, but I guess not a believer.
He probably just wanted to keep it that way.  He just picked the parts he liked and wanted to know about.
Yup. Nice chatting with you.
Hey there. Are you religious? If so, you know that the bible is the best selling book.
I bet it has sold a ton of copies! It is not uncommon for american students to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary education and they are required to use the bible to read.
Yeah, I wonder how they would have gotten through with that level of discipline in those times?
Yes it was.  Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible, cutting out the supernatural parts and cutting out all the miracles in the resurrection and the supernatural part of the bible.
I would take everything in the bible with a grain of salt but with as much respect as Thomas Jefferson, but I would take any dispute on the bible and use it with as little respect as possible.
It has changed over time, and language.  The Bible was translated into Latin in the 4th century and the reason it was translated is because the word "malus" means apple and evil in that language. Interesting coincidence.  I wonder if the word apple was used for apple in the Bible before the Bible was transformed into Latin.  Apple and evil are the same word and came to be known together as malus, or apple.
Yes, there is a consensus that there are three canonical ways to interpret the bible, but I don't really know how to interpret it. I would like to study the bible deeply some day and come up with a consensus. I think I may study the Bible deeply some more.
The biblical tower of Babel is a historical document, but is based on a real building, the Etemenanki in Iraq.  I wonder how it would be different if it were a real build or if it was based on the historical document of the biblical tower, the tower of babel?
I suppose it's a relief that so much of the supernatural in the Bible can be traced back to reality.  I wonder if parts like that are just supernatural and can't be traced Back to reality?
The Bible definitely has a place in government, though. People still use it in ceremonies and in the constitution.  Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams both used the bible at their swearing-in ceremonies.
Yeah, I think that was the last one of the presidents that did that.
I guess they didn't want to follow tradition. They felt they were owed allegiance to the government and the people so they had to follow it.
I completely agreed with that.  They were not honorable, in my opinion.  I think the dubiousness that was infused into the Bible is something the American people would see as dubiousness in my view, but in my Opinion, it was more honorable.
Yes, there is disagreement among the Christian denominations about what should be included in the canon. It's unclear what accepted is "canon" and what is "not".
Yeah, the Apocrypha, which is regarded with varying levels of respect, is a disagreement.
I think that the ideas that we have in the past have been discarded for political reasons or for different ideas.
Yes, and Thomas Jefferson was one of the brave men in politics who tried to open our eyes to that. He was one to use ingenuity and dissent to save himself and other brave men, but it is not always possible.
I think that it is good for people to have a range of ideas on the bible or politics, but that perspective must change as the times change and a new perspective must be given to a range and a different perspective.  It is good that there is a range, but we have to be able to have that range of Ideas.
Yeah, and it's always surprising that apple was not around when the Bible was translated into Latin, so the meaning of the bible was translated when there was a disagreement. I wonder if in the future it will be possible to reach a conclusion without any more disagreement.
 translation is tough! But disagreement is the way of the pursuit of knowledge. It reveals that language has historical meaning and we can never end up with the same meaning. The chat with you reveals that Language has historical value in the pursuit for all of us.
Yeah same here, have a great day.
Thanks you too!  You too!
Bye! :)  :)
Football and avocado ice cream, my friend!
Football is a sport that is a special time for me. The World Cup is a very special time, because football plays all around the globe and around the world.
As long as there have been bowlers, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars!
I wonder if bowlers knew the score of the game back then.  Historical timing, football was just the game and the bowlers were the best.  I loved bowling.  It's like football, but with more historical timing.
Football is a family of team sports.  It is beautifully done.  Different variations of footballs, rugby, soccer, gaelic football, football codes, soccer and different variations ofFootballs are all football codes.
It is a game of ball played on the foot, in different forms and by different peoples in all the vast planet. It is a sport for all the peoples of this vast planet in different ways and forms
Sports are so awesome! I also like the art area of school. I'm bad at it, I prefer to read than to paint, but the art part of school can be awesome. I used to paint in school prior to that, I think it's a part of the school's art area. It's not uncommon for kids to have a bible and bible as part of their school art, I don't like the Bible as much though, too nerdy haha.
I guess that is the way it has to work, we want our children to get a good education and get up to work in this world.
I completely agree with you!
I wonder what the truth is?  Information, information, information?  What facts do you think children should be getting from teachers for knowledge, or data, or facts?
I think truth is the best selling book of all time! It is beautiful how they feel that way. They are on a spiritual mission to find the truth. They feel like they are on some sort of spiritual mission, blindfolded and distracted by the material world to get there. Like Brady in "the truth" is a beautiful way to go about a spiritual quest.
I hope that a Brady tract can speed people up and help them seek out the truth, truth, and help everyone find their own way.  I hope that the Brady tract is useful to everyone on the journey to the truth.  It seems to help everyone who is looking for the truth to find it for themselves.
I bet he is, I hear that he owns a bible.  Did you know the Bible has a total of 6 billion copies in the world.  I bet it is whihc is the best seller in the whihC in the total.
I didn't know that! That makes sense. I guess there is a demand for books. I think that's why there are so many copies, but I didn't really see it in that light. 5 billion copies? I guess that's a demand.
I think that could explain why our life almost feels like a series of books to explain everything.  It's like a veil of sorts over our living for the time being.  One facinating theory is that people used to spell out the bible in apple.  The bible was translated into many different languages and in the 4th century there were people living in different languages at the time.  That's why the apple had the spell out.
No but I have seen it. It's about a tragic existence where the start of a name is a state of culpitude and the end of a tragic state. I think that apples have had a deal with that for a while.
Two US presidents, Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams, were the only two presidents to use a bible during their swearing in ceremonies. Teddy Roosevelt was the only one to do so.
Maybe they just wanted to swear allegiance to a deity?  It is not like the constituion needs a deity, just someone who wanted to sworn allegiance to it.
That's interesting, but it makes sense.  I was always curious about that.  Curious how many presidents have used the bible as their bible and that is very interesting.
I would expect that it was more of a tradition, but it is unusual that the Bible would be used as a tradition.
In latin the word apple and evil is the same thing.  Pretty interesting.
True. apples are good for health, bad for faith, good forhealth. Thank you for chatting, have a good night!
haha that was fun!  You have a good night too!  Namaste!
Have you heard of the "method of first using" method?
I have not. What is the TB12 method?
It is a book written by NFL, its a training methods and diet, its like a book wrote by NFL
Yes, it is a book written by Tom Brady.
I think it is, but I think it was a credits. He used to play football, I think.
I can't argue with success. I am more of a tom brady fan. There is a Tom brady book worth reading.
I am a devoted Boston fan, are you?
Who is your favorite team?
I like many teams but in the NFL my favorite is the Giants, out of the 32 teams in the nfl my favorite one is the SF Giants
I grew up in Southern Cal, so the Rams are a sentimental favorite since I grew up there too.  Needless to say, I was disappointed when they didn't get to the super bowl, and I was so disappointed with the Rams.
Yea, it was a rough game, not as bad as Georgia Tech beating Cumberland 222-0, that was a bad game though
I can imagine how it must have felt to be them to lose that badly.  I think they stopped trying after the game and they stopped using the huddle.
It was actually a pretty appalling performance by Cumberland.  It was a worse performance than the one in 1924, but that was many years before the worse performance by the US.
Interesting fact about the team that painted the opposing teams locker room pink, I wonder why?
I find it pretty funny the University of Iowa did that, painting the visiting locker room pink
Yeah,  they should go back to the way they used to be,  just one team.
I wonder if they have pink locker rooms too. That sounds much worse than pink locker room.
Last laughs last laughs! I know!
I guess engineers laugh too. They make more in a lifetime than the average NFL player does. I wonder how much more than theAverage NFL player will make in their lifetime?
That is a pretty amazing stat.  I understand why, football player have such long careers with so many injuries.  It is not like a football player can get away with that often.
Nice talking to you.  Have a nice one.
Do you watch the NFL?
I do like football, but I don't follow it too much. I heard something funny one time. The university of Iowa visiting locker room is painted completely pink!
Yeah, I wonder what their reasoning is. I wonder if women can play too?
Wow, I didn't know that. Did you know the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of actual play time? That's not much at all, and that's the average nfl game, with only 11 minutes and 17 minutes ofactual play time!
Yeah that is pretty short, crazy. Do you know what the highest score ever was in a game?  It was 222 to 0.  That is the highest scored ever in a football game.
I think I read that an average lifetime earnings of an NFL player is less than an engineer.  I wonder what the average lifetime earning of an engineer is.
Yeah I guess that makes sense since engineers work longer, did you know that the game score was 222-0 in 1916?
Wow, that is crazy.  I did not know tht the NFL uses tracking devices in players shoulder pads to track their movements.
Yeah, pretty cool, tracking velocity and rotation and all that fun stuff.
Yeah, it's pretty interesting. On a different note, I just found out that it's not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read the bible as part of their education.
Wow, I am glad we have moved on from that. Jefferson made his own version of the bible, so glad we are moved away from that version of that
I heard that Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams were the only presidents who did not use a Bible at their swearing in ceremonies. I wonder if that is the same one that Teddy Teddy Roosevelt used for his swearing in?
I guess they didn't want to have to use the Bible version, Jefferson swore in with the Bible and I guess he wasn't religious.  Maybe he didn't like the supernatural stuff.
yeah,that would be interesting. I wonder if apple had it when the bible was translated into Latin in 335 BC.
The word malus means apple, which is evil.
Yes.  Did you know that the biblical tower of Babel was destroyed by the Etemenanki in modern day Iraq?  It was based on the biblical Tower of Babel.
That is pretty cool. I wonder if it exists in Iraq? I also think it's pretty cool that the bible sold so many copies that the first edition of the biblesold for $500
I believe it is considered one of the best selling book, but it is influential and is considered the most influential book ever.
Yeah it is, 1.5 billion copies grants it the title of best selling of all time, and its the 3rd best selling book of 2014, so over a billion copies of the title
Yes.  Did you know that the bible is translated from Greek and is known as the books of the books.
That is pretty cool. I guess it makes sense since "bible" is such a broad term.
Do you watch the NFL?
Hello there, I sure do the NFL is the national football league, it is the best in business and I never thought it would be outlawed, I thought it was outlawed
Yeah the NFL is still around. It's a big deal in the US. There are 32 teams.
I think there are 32 teams. Which state do you think has the most teams?
yes there are 32 teams, and lots of games, the 16 game season is only 5 weeks, so 16 weeks in a season,
17 weeks seems short. That's not a lot of vacation. It's a work year and a lot to do. You must have a great job. You have a lot in your work year.
Yeah, that's a good point.  Iowa has a pink locker room for visitors.  I wonder why.
I think it is to raise awareness of breast cancer.  A lot of football players get breast cancer, and I think it helps to raise Awareness.
That might be the reason. Bowlers seems made more money than the football players though in the 1960s.
Bowlers were not ideal athletes back in the day, I can respect that, they painted the lanes and the ball pink for breast cancer awareness and the bowlers did the same, they actually painted the bowling ball pink
Yeah I guess.  Nowadays engineers in their lifetime make more money than football players.
 engineers are the profession for breast cancer awareness. They are always in pink.
Yeah I guess so. Did you know that women can play in the NFL?
Yes that is good. They wear pink uniforms and stuff like that to raise breast cancer awareness.
Yeah that would be something. I wonder if they use tracking chips on the players for the games?
Yes, I think that would be great to track which players are at risk for breast cancer.
Yes, I hope so!  I think it might make the game safer too.  They check for velocity, rotation, etc. to make the games safer.
I think so.  I know that cancer is easier to treat when it is caught earlier, but football is on the front lines and they are on the back lines.
Yeah, it is. Off topic but do you know much about the Bible?
Yes, I read it a few times, it has interesting characters and a plot that gets going in the middle of the plot at some times,
Yeah, a lot of history in it and a lot to do with a lot.
Do you watch football?  I do.
I used to when I got a chance but not anymore, I like to watch it when I get the chance. Do you like the patriots? Do you know their role in it?
Yes, the NFL has 32 teams, the most of any NFL
Wow that is a good question. I think there are 32, but I am not sure how many are actually on.
Benjarvis Green-Ellis is a running back who never fumbled the football in his NFL career.
I didn't know that. I wonder if he's a patriot. He is ironic because he is not a patriot but he must have had good stock.
I think that is pretty cool. Football is the kind of sport that is interesting in so many countries, it is the same kind of Sport in so few different countries.
Honestly, I guess I don't even know how to call it a sport played with feet on a ball, but I guess it is a sport with a ball?
That is true, but I like football.  I like soccer more, but maybe not Hungary, where it is known as soccer.
In some parts of Africa, rugby is football.  In Australia, rugby has two names.  I think in Australia Rugby is football and rugby is not.
The NFL regular season only lasts 16 weeks, so only 11 weeks of it!
It's about 16 weeks, I think it's about 20 weeks now. If I'm not mistaken, the playoffs are right around the corner.
What is the highest score in a football game?
Wow! I can imagine it's pretty high, but I don't know if it's a college or professional game.
Yes it was in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland in a 222-0, I don't know what happened after that
Wow, that must have been hated on the bus ride home!  ESPN won an award for it, did you know?
I did not know that, but it was an extremely high scoring game! Did you know that in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars and in the 1960s top football star's made twice what top bowlists did?
Yeah, I didn't know that. ESPN won an Emmy for the superimposed line.
Well, the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than that of the average MLB player and an average NFL player.  The average lifetime earnings of an Engineer is higher then the average Lifetime earning of theaverage MLB player.
Yeah, but they can still get millions!
That is true. I would rather do that too!
Do you like football?  I like it.
I love the NFL. The first real sports league I ever liked. Do you like it?
Me too! I wonder if we'll ever see female players.
I think there has been a womans league but in the NFL they dont
I think they could if they met the requirements to be able to legally play in the NFL, they don't have any rules against women, they just cannot legally play if they have never met the Requirements.
I think that is great!  I think that a woman could do great.
I wonder what the actual game is like and how often they play, I know the actual one is only 11 minutes and that sounds a bit short for a play, maybe 15 minutes or so sounds a little bit short
Yeah,  and then the refs make up for that with breaks and a half times and timeout and calls and other breaks and such.
Yes. Do you know how much money a player makes?
It depends on the contract and his contract, but I think it is like milliopns or something like that.  He can negociate it if he wants to.
I wonder if they play concerts at halftime?  Did you know that the super bowl halftime shows have been doing that since 1991?
I don't like half time shows haha. I change the channel before and after the half time Shows haha. What about you?
Me too, what about music and concerts, do you like it?
Yeah, I do, I like going to a live concert not watching it on TV. Have you ever gone to a concert not watch?
The ramones have played 2,263 concerts in 20 years, that is almost 20 concerts every 20 years!
Yes and then add to that Linkin Park played 324 in 20 years.  That was in 2001.
I know, right?  A Creed concert was so bad in 2002 that four goers filed a lawsuit.  Sounds funny, but it was actually because the concert was that bad.
ya that seems pretty pathetic, I wonder who gets their money back and who gets to go home haha, I want my money back, I think that's pretty pathetic
yup, it is, I have been to some of those events.
I don't think I could deal with that deal, a concert can be a bad way to go, I enjoy it too much if I have to go.
Do you like to go to concerts at all? There are many concerts coming up that sound fun.
Hey, I haven't checked recently but I gotta look!  Gotta look up soon.  Hey, I hope you have a great night.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Hope you have it too!
You too have a good night!
Good night!  You too!
Hello, do you follow the NFL?
I'm not an avid fan, but sort of know the basics as a sort of an avid, what about you?
I follow the important games. I have a favorite team and am a diehard fan so I follow theimportant games. Do you have aFavorite team?
I like the packers! They play outdoors in the best kind of weather. I always respect a team that can play outdoors.
Yeah they are a good team, they can play in harsh conditions, I guess ads take over the screen for the last minutes of gameplay, but yeah they have a goodTeam
Yeah, and the entertainment, like concerts and shows during halftime.  I would think the ads and the commentators would be more entertainment, but it is usually just a concert or a concert, so I am ok with the ads.
I agree.  But I prefer concerts.  Linking Park gave a really great concert in 2001.
 linkin park is an amazing band, I would like to go to a concert of their. I hear on the radio there is a ton of synthesized music so I would definitely like to hear that.
I agree they are great and I agree, they gave out over 324 concerts back in 2001 alone, thats so many! they were lucky they had an album that was so great, they are really lucky to have given out that many concerts
That is an insane tour schedule.  That must have taken its toll on the person.  I would like to see some of those in smaller venues, not such big venues.  They must have an insane touring schedule.
I bet it does, that is a lot of money that is for sure, I wonder if they had to do 20 concerts a month, that seems harsh but made up for a lot in the equation, I bet they did a concert for day or two during the holidays and maybe a concert or two after a lot. I think it is about 2 concerts a week, that's a lot to do and a lot a lotof money.
True.  Sometimes bands break up for some reason or other and the tour bus has to get on people's nerves.  It's a tiny space and the whole time they are on a tour, the band is on the tour, and the band has to be on the go all the time in that tiny space.
Yeah, I think that's what happened with Creed too. It's crazy how you enjoy something for a few weeks or months and then it's not the same and then you're like, "Oh yeah, we're done".  You can't go to concerts again.
Well, things can go wrong, sometimes they do.  I heard that people were suing the band because their concert was so bad, it was so wrong.  Did you sue the band or the concert?
I really wanted to sue the band, the concert didn't meet my expectations, but I don't know who I would have wanted to sued the band.
I would like to be on the page of a Pink Floyd book. They should record a live concert without the audience so they can make the video. Or at least record it and record a video with no audience and just make theVideo.
That would be a great idea.  I think it would be disturbing if it was a band with no audience, like U2.  They don't really have an audience anymore.
I think they have, but that band is probably hard up for money and they are performing to much money and have lawsuits.
I agree. Do you follow politics much?
I do, I think it is important to stay informed in this day and age, there is so much controversy, and it is very important toStay informed.
I do follow politics, I think its important that some decisions are being made for the country, it is important to know what is happening in the country
Hello!  What are your thoughts on the Colin Kaepernick dismissal after the complaint?
I don't follow it too closely, but if I follow it on the non- business side I think that anytime there is an arbitrator it generally isn't favorable to him. But on the business side, I don't know.
That is true. I support Colin.
Interesting. Do you follow football? I don't care for it to be honest.
He has a good attorney in Mark Geragos.
I heard that!  Crazy!  Did you know the NFL uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads to record their moves?
That is hi-tech.  I wonder if the other teams use all that technology too.
I think fairly soon, I think they will use it.  I think that technology has an immense amount of money to pay for it.
That's a great question.  I'm not sure.  Maybe the results of the differences in the results are because women can play if they meet eligibility requirements.  Women played in the 60s but not now.  Have you seen the women's played?
I think women were the players when Iwas in high school, I didn't think they played.  Do you like the Foo Fighters?  Apparently they had a concert there once and it played to New Zealand seismic monitors.  I wonder if the concert was by the women's team?
I love Linkin Park, I love the Foo Fighters too, I have been to many concerts, I used to love them, I really love Link in Park.
I have never seen them live, but they must be pretty good.
I did not. I know Creed had a bad concert in 2002 and fans filed lawsuits because of it.
That is sort of surprising, I like Creed. Their music is also really complex to play, it is really complex.
I'm not surprised. I think singers make a lot of money, too. The presidents of the US are also wealthy, JFK, Washington, and Jefferson were the only presidents that were not. And I know singers make  a lot.
Well apparently in 1972 Deep Purple broke the world record for loudest concert, and an audience was rendered unconscious.
I imagine how scary that must have been.
I know!  Due to the fact that they blew their ears out!
It may be, I don't know.  Do you expect them to be live, I wonder how many concerts are live?
A bunch of them. Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration and he was the only president to do so.
That's pretty cool!  I hope he got to live in the White House guest house, since it's larger than the President's.  I wonder if he got the White house guest house.
Hi, do you know much about the presidency?
I think that he should be stripped of the war powers and national emergency powers he has accumulated. He needs those powers andNational emergency powers should be taken away and stripped away.
I think a good presidency makes good. It's bad one abuses those powers, but it's not bad when the person holding them doesn't. It is bad when a bad presidency makes bad.
I think we should trust a good president with powers that are decreased rather than decreased. I think a bad one would ratchet upwards and then we would have a bad president withpowers that would ratcheted upwards again.
Yeah, it's hard to know what will come back to help us if a precedent is established. I'm worried that the damage would be long lasting. I don't think we should let it go, but I'm not sure if the damage will be so hard to take back, so I'm sure we will have to be worried about it.
Watergate was the first time Presidential powers were ever really reined in. I think we really needed to see the accumulating power under Obama be reined- in. The process of reversing grants and grants is a power grab imo. We are in a process of the first of many, and the next one will be the last.
yeah, you dont hear about a lot of other countries, but you always worry about wars, you just dont hear much about ours.
Yeah, it's scary that the President's power to start wars is getting so much better, and there are no safeguards against it, and yeah, the President power to use a nuclear football too imo, that is scary.
Yeah I think that the threat still exists, it would be bad if things got nuclear.. but we are not nuclear. that threat still persists.
Fire and Fury, the war of words between Trump and Kim Jong-un, I would be scared if that was to happen back in 2018, I mean Trump was threatening, and now we're going through a war of Words between them.
Yeah, I wish it had been handled better. I think that trade wars and even real wars are a story for another day.  It's hard to reverse that kind of disaster.
I'm afraid he is going to take advantage of war to declare martial law if he is reelected. He is also going to worry himself into a nuclear winter if he does. I mean, it's already burning in Japan and Korea, they have had enough nuclear winter. I wonder if he will try to take the advantage of War to declare Martial law.
The limits of presidential powers are being tested. and congress refuses to impeach Trump, no matter how hard they try.
The Democrats are afraid they might wind up losing seats in the next election if they try to remove Clinton. They failed and they failed. Trying to remove clinton hurt the republicans politically and now they are failing.
That makes sense.  The impeachment of Clinton was because of her mistress, she didnt care about the mistress.  She had enough problems in world to care about.  I would have never bothered with the impeachment.  But she was too bothered by other problems in the world to Care about anything else.
That's pretty tame compared to Trump's history of corruption and fraud and perjury.
Yes his involvement with Russia really bothers me, his crimes were during the cold war and his involvement in the involvement with Putin during the Cold War.
They are also pushing for a right-wing coup in Venezuela.
That's crazy. He wanted to invade. I think it's hard to invade a country if you don't really want to invade it. It would be like an invasion. Anyway, great chat!
I think we are done for, thanks for the round.
Yeah, lets start on turn 4, wrap up with a risky one on server 1.  It is acting a little risky.  Good night.
You too! Thanks! You too!
Hello, do you know much about presidents?
I know some stuff.  I know who the wealthiest US presidents are.
I am sure it is JFK, Washington and Jefferson, and you?
Yes. Did you know the guest house is larger than the white house?
Yeah that is pretty cool, I think they get a lot of people there.
Yeah, I wonder. I heard the president of Indonesia is a pop star.
Yeah the guy has already released 3 albums, wow, and released 3 of them
I didn't know that, how did he get elected?
Yes, the runner up moved into that position, pretty nice!
Yeah that is fair, they work a lot together,
Do you watch TV much?
Yes I do. Did you ever watch the Simpsons?
I love that show. Did you know that there is only one episode of "Bart" in which he does not appear?
Yeah and the weird part is that he was not even mentioned in it, and he wasn't even mentioned at all.
Yeah pretty strange. Did you ever watch that 70s show?
I have, it was cancelled after 10 episodes, I guess they did not like it or they cancelled it too soon
Yeah, I guess explains why they remade it verbatim, they must have not liked it as much.
True. Do you like pokemon?
I have seen a few episodes.  How about you?
Yeah it has been on air since 1989, that's over 16 years, that is so long, and yeah I haven't seen them all
Yeah it really is, that's amazing that they have been around that long
Who was your favorite US president?
I'm partial to Rutherford B Hayes, what about you?
Mine is the same, I like Lincoln for abolishing slavery, you?
Lincoln is a good choice.
I did see him in person, but not in interent.  I know of him through his books and some of his books.  He died a century ago, but he is still around and interent!
hahaha, I meant the movie with him, I liked it.  I like Daniel Day Lewis, he is like Lincoln.
Haha, I know, I have to watch it, I can see him staring in it.
It's really good, I've raved about DDL before, it was nominated for a bunch of awards and is really good.
Trump is the wealthiest president of the United States.
Wow, that's good to know! I thought it was JFK or someone else.
Yeah, but his wealth is tiny compared to Trump's, he has a $100 billion dollar networth, and he thinks his wealth has value of $300 billion dollar worth.
Wow that is surprising knowing him, but not surprising knowing how he is. Did you know there was a president called president banana?
It is an odd nickname for the president of Zimbabwe, but then that was the president in Zimbabwe right?
Yes, President Carrot catching on.
Haha. The president of Indonesia has released a total of 3 pop albums while in office.
I feel like the president of the US has released 3, but I feel like that means they are slackers, or slacking off or something.  They should have released more.
haha ya I think so too, did you know the guest house of the whitehouse is actually bigger than the white house? I wonder why that is? I know the white House has a guest house but not the guest of the Whitehouse
I wonder if they use the runner up as a VP?
Yeah, I'm glad that has changed now. Nice chatting with you, I am glad that it has changed.
Same to you, can you imagine Hillary and Trump in the white house together?
Haha!  No!  I disagree with you on that!
Yeah, they would.  Great chatting with you!
Hey, I guess Presidential duties depend on who is in charge of the country so I guess presidential duties depend upon who is the one in charge, right?
Hi! I don't know how I'm a fan, but I do find presidential trivia interesting. I wonder who the top three wealthiest US presidents were and who the current three are? Do you know?
I think it was Washington and Jefferson, I think Trump is the only person in between, but I'm not sure.
JFK, right? I think he is the only one.
I wonder how rich president Banana of Zimbabwe is haha? he is really loaded, he must be loaded
I was not aware of that, President Banana?  Interesting.  Did you know that the guest house of the White House is bigger than the White house?  I wasn't aware of this, I wonder why?
haha I didn't know that but I'm not sure it makes any sense. Do you know when the rules for elections changed?
I agree!  I wonder why they had to change it, and how?
Well they were originally the runner-up of the election in 1805, so they were actually originally VP! Talk about a lot of drama in the election, haha. Vice President Hillary Clinton and President Trump. I wonder if there was a lot more drama in 1806.
Wow, that would be crazy. That would force us to work on a topic that is already partisan, and force us both to be partisan. Do you watch a lot of TV?
I do quite a bit actually. I don't have cable so I watch netflix but I like the show stranger things. Do you watch net Netflix?
I used to watch a lot of tv too, I love Stranger things. I also like Family Guy, South Park and The Simpsons. When South Park aired their last episode of Family Guy the crew of The Simpsons sent them flowers. I think South Park did that too.
I didn't know that! haha, I can't wait for the next season of Stranger Things!  One episode I really miss is George Carlin's "The episode that never was" haha, it was so funny! I can wait for that early season of stranger things!
That must have been an amazing episode, I miss him too. There are a lot of famous narrators out there, he was one of the narration for Thomas the Tank Engine, he did the narration For that episode.
No I didn't know that, I heard that they have had great celebrities doing voices haha, like George Carlin, George Carin, Alec Baldwin, Ringo Starr, I think there's so many great celebrities that the show would not be the same without those voices haha
I was surprised that they did, I am a fan of the Simpsons and not that big of a big of one, so I am not surprised.
I like the Simpsons a lot, talk about a TV show I can't talk about without seeing it! Haha. Apparently one episode where Bart doesn't appear is the best one to check out, have you seen it?
No, I don't but I'm surprised it's been on so long that they would do that!
I am not surprised at all, but I think it's missing other characters, like Homer for instance. I've heard that they are missing other episodes too.
I haven't seen it either but I am curious to find out. Have you ever watched the pokemon cartoon? I have, I'm curious to finds out more about that.
Yes, I used to love that show as a kid. My favorite pokemon is Pikachu. There are over 750 episodes of that show, I think my favorite pokemon at this point is the one that has over 750 shows and 750 episodes now, I love it.
Hi, do you watch TV?
I do watch a lot of TV. I enjoy the internet. I agree benefits of the internet are offset by the largest drawback: acceptance of anonymity. Do you enjoy the Internet?
I dont watch much TV, but I think anonymity is dangerous. I can see how they treat people who get used to using the internet. It is like a mild addiction. They want to disassociate the fact that they are a real person from the internet and just forget about it.
Agreed, celebrities like Roseanne have done that before. Valerie Jarrett was once fired from Roseanne because of a tweet from an anonymous account, but she didn't tweet about the consequences of being fired, so she was just fired from the show.
True, and people like Trump tweet all the time. I think there would have been internet outrage and more internet outrage. But then she would have had recourse for the next time.
That is true. I suppose public officials like politicians can pretty much do whatever they want. Speaking of politicians, did you know Woodrow Wilson is the only president to have held a PhD?
I was not aware of that distinction.  That is kind of surprising to me.
Agreed.  As surprising as knowing that the last president to speak a foreign language was FDR.  I think the candidates who run these days are often wrong, and the only candidates who can speak aforeign language were the last two.  That's why I don't think they should run these now.
I wouldnt know! I heard Nevada has an option for a "none of these candidates" option on the ballot so if you dont like any of the selections there you can go to a group to vote for someone that wouldnt be one of them. That would be great.
Agreed. I think that would be so sad, knowing there are only 5 presidents that have been elected despite losing the popular vote. I wonder if any of them got elected despite lost the popularVote?
That is crazy, I wonder what other countries election procedures are like.
Good point! I am watching a documentary on it right now. I love Shark Tank, I find it really surprising knowing most deals that are made are never enacted. That is very surprising knowing Most deals are never actually enacted.
I love Shark Tank, but I wonder how many deals fall through.
There's no telling!  I'm sure they find ways to get something that is worth it, but I don't know.  I think it's funny Homer held 188 jobs in the first 400 episodes of The Simpson's, but no telling how many he was able to find after that.
I heard about that,  didnt he work in a beer factory,  a power plant,  or a power station?  I don't remember any of those,  but I do remember him in the beer factory.
That is so hard to keep track of.  Daniel radcliffe voiced the character of the Simpson's greenhouse in the parody of Twilight's Edward Cullen.  Did you know that the Simpson greenhouse is actually a parody of twilight's horror xxi?
I had heard that before. I didnt know that about Radcliffe, but I didnt think I would like that. Ringo Starr actually narrated 52 episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine.
I never knew that. I'm a fan of Shakespeare, but I don't know if I knew that he did that. He's one of the few to work on his own work instead of being adapted from another show or film. I know that The Two Noble Kinsmen made it to tv but I'm not too sure if I've seen it. I don's it in my mind.
It must be hard to get picked up for his works.
That's a good question. I'm not sure. I'll have to look it up and find out. Speaking of phones, did you know that Hedy Lamarr was the first to call for an "I" phone on a cellphone? She deserves a ton of praise for helping to invent the phones, gps and wi-fi. She deserves some help helping invent phones back in 1876, and she deserves every bit of the praise for it.
Oh wow!  Back then it took so long to be developed and she was one of the first to do it.  Wow!
I know, it took so long!  And there is basically no correlation between bars and connection quality!  So I'm surprised there is a lot of value in today's bars.  It was so nice chatting with you today, we owe you a lot!  We can't believe how far we have come, but I'm sure it's all come a long way.  There's basically norelation between bars or connection quality now.
China is a competitive country, what are your thoughts on it?
I agree, its crazy that the US has a $330 billion dollar trade surplus with the China and they have a $300 billion dollartrade surplus with us
I can't believe the trade surplus. China is a titan, but it kind of makes me afraid of them.  I think the theft of technology and their use of money is why we have concerns about their trade surplus, and China is not going to go down without a fight.
So true, we get a lot from China, $300 billion dollars worth of goods that we don't even have to buy from other countries, and they buy almost 2 billion dollars of our goods.  Sounds like the same thing to me, it's scary dealing with them, it sounds like we are getting $1 billion dollars per second of goods from them.
Yes, that's a good point. We have to end up being mutually beneficial in the end, so that exports can be a number one destination for our exports and then number two for our own.
I think expanding our defense spending and trying to keep peace will benefit us as well, but I think it will be pretty safe to say our Asian allies are going to want more defense spending too.
I think that if we kept our allies going strong, the war would end because of all the good things Trump has done and the war will not be that strong.
I doubt it. Trump did sign the bill to produce more military ships at the top of the times. They need to stay on high alert at all times.
I agree with you, I think Trump is trying to show strenght and hope he can do that, but we need to do more, I do agree with him though, Trump is not one of the top 3 wealthiest presidents in US history, do you know who the top three wealthiest presidents were?
Wow, that is surprising, I try to stay aware of who the wealthiest presidents are and I think that's why I try and stay aware, I also try to keep a good side job going LOL, is President Trump a billionaire, that's surprising, and yes I think he is, he is a billionaire and that is really something, wow!
I think he is, I think all Presidents are crazy rich, I wonder if he is on the list?  I do know that the guest house is bigger than the white house, the guestHouse in the whitehouse is bigger then the white residence itself.
Haha, that's pretty crazy, the wealthiest?  I wonder if that means he's got more money than the president in Indonesia?  He's the president there right?  That's pretty insane, huh?  Maybe Trump could make some pop albums while in office, or do concerts and bring in some money.  Haha, I think Trump could made some pop Albums, maybe he could bring in more money that way haha.
Thats fun to imagine,  I don't know that he is top 3 right now so it is crazy but he could make one of those albums lol I wonder if he sold a decent amount of albums lol he must be able to make some,  he has sold a few albums so that would be fun to Imagine
lol  If he were president, I would love concerts and go to football games. I love concerts.
I have a feeling he does. I went to one concert one time and the band was Creed and I was totally disappointed in them. I didn't like them.
Haha! I've been to a few Creed concerts, some of them really bad, but some were fantastic. I heard at one point there was a lawsuit against Creed at one time because of a bad show at a small venue years ago, but I'm sure it was clean and sober at this point.
They had some good songs but the vocalist was viewed as a total mess, the band was a total Mess, too much talent wasted and not enough good songs.
Speaking of which, Scott Stapp doesn't even play with Creed anymore. He's had a solo career in his own life and he's pretty high on his solo career, but I don't think he's drunk enough to stop doing concerts. Speaking of concerts, did you know the Ramones played 2,263 concerts over 20 years? I wonder how many of those were high?
That's a lot of concerts, I didn't know that about the Ramones. Shame they didn't do as many as they made out to do. I wonder if they had a lot more? That's a great show, but I don't think it would have been possible.
I do like the Ramones, Chester passed away but I still really like some of their songs, one of my favorite ones being 'Do the Ramoned' I also like Linkin Park a lot.  They played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.  I would have loved to go to one of their concerts but unfortunately Chester passed so I never got to see any.
Chesters death was so sad, the world of music lost a lot that day,
Did you know the top 3 wealthiest presidents were JFK, Jefferson, and George Washington.
I did know that, that is interesting, I know they owned alot of land too.
Yes that's interesting. I'm sure they had different opinions on issues. Until 1805, the runner up in the presidential election for the vice president was decided by becoming the VP. That means for most of the time the VP was the runnerup in the White House.
That is interesting, good times have changed.
Yes.  Did you know the first president of Zimbabwe's name was president banana?  President Banana?  lol
That is crazy, did you know the president of indonesia makes pop albums?
I wonder how much time he has been in office?
I don't know how many concerts he has been to.
Yes, I love going to small club concerts and to big stage shows.  I don't like the big stage show anymore.  Most bands put on these big stadiums and arenas now.
I think alot are coming out this year.  I know that there is going to be a concert in an ancient Roman amphitheatre.  It's the last concert in the ancient Roman Amphitheatre, so I think alot of alot are Coming out next year.
That would be neat! In 1972 Pink Floyd recorded a live concert at the ancient Roman amphitheater in Pompeii, with no audience!
That must be very interesting to see and sound.  I wonder how good it is.  Do you know how good?
Yes, I agree!  There's also an ancient roman amphitheater in Croatia that is still used for concerts.  I wonder what concerts are there.
Interesting, I wonder if they put on a bad show there? Like the band Creed did in 2002. They had so many lawsuits because of a badshow, did they put one on or did they do something better?
I don't know them either.  They must have really stunk the place up.  lol  Linkin Park played a lot of shows in 2001.  There were a total of 324 shows in one night.
I think the Ramones have played alot of gigs, too. Non-stop touring for 20 year period, that must be tiring.  They played alot over a 20 yearperiod, non-stop.
Yes it is. The Ramones played 2,263 gigs in that span.
I am not sure, how many?
That's a lot of shows in 20 years, I would like to see one in one day but not that many.
That is quite the band.
It's been nice chatting with you today.  Nice chatting with You.
Do you like concerts? I do.
I do like concerts, I havent had the chance to go to one recently, how about you?
I go to some indoor stuff and some outdoor arenas. I like the outdoor ones.
Yeah, I like them in sheds, and in the warm months.  I like amphitheaters too.  Great in the amphitheater.
Yeah, Jiffy Lube live is fun.  Linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001.
That is amazing!  I bet the fans were ecstatic.  They must have had a ton of energy.  The kids must have been really into it too.
Yeah that was pretty cool too bad the new singer did not do as well, he seems pretty cool though.
I heard he had committed suicide, they were a great band and he helped them to have the best selling album of the 21st century and it was the best Selling album of that century, I think it was, he committed suicide I think, I wonder why.
Yeah that is too bad.  Have you ever seen Creed in concert?
no, i have never. i heard some stories though. creed had some fans who were so serious that they even considered rehearsing a bit before the concerts, including legal action from the fans.
Hilarious! I've been to a concert that was terrible, to be honest.
I saw them play once in Pompeii.  It seems like they did a play in an amphitheater in Croatia..  It was empty though.
Yeah, they should, I wonder if they do, do you watch football?
I do, nowadays I don't watch it a lot, do you?
I watch it every year on sunday at a bar, I think.
Nice, that is a nice way to spend an afternoon. This year I didnt get to watch the playoffs or the superbowl, but I did watch the whole season.
I watched the superbowl.  I thought it was really boring this year.  It was terrible!
It was bad this year. I always wanted the underdog to win, but this year it was a defensive battle with a big comeback. I don't know if you like defensive battle, but I wanted the UNDERdog to win.
Yeah, I tend to think low scoring games are boring.  I like to see something going on.  Anyway, it's been nice chatting, but I tend that the low scoring game are boring for me.
Great chat!  Have a good day!
You too! Thanks! :)
Did you hear about Aaron Rodgers?
No, what is that? I don't know much about football.
Hello,  yes I like football, soccer or american football.  How about you?
I did not realize that the season only lasts about 16 weeks, I didn't realize it was already 16 weeks.
I did not know that either.  The first week of February is the super bowl which is the first week in February.
That is only because the rest of the season only lasts like six weeks, so only two weeks in a season.
Apparently the Patriots fans don't like that.  They don't want Creed called a bye week, as it is called in Bill we trust.
I saw that, very impressive. You asked about Aaron Rodgers, he is the highest paid player, he's the highest. I think I asked about aaron rodgers, he was the highest payer.
Yeah four year is $84 million. wow. Hard to believe the top NFL players are only getting paid that. In the 1960s, at that time bowlers made twice as much as the top nfl players
I know.  He is the most valuable NFL player.
He is the same age as Tom Brady, so no excuses. He works hard and he deserves it. he doesn't have any excuses. he is old, but he still works hard.
I'm just hopeful.  He wrote a post on Instagram, "I am excited and looking forward for amazing memories with the shows.  I wrote that I wrote apost on Instagram,  Im hopeful for more shows to come."
Who is your favorite team? I like the packards. I don't know about women, but there is no written rule which prevents women from joining the NFL, do you know?
That is neat. I wonder if that will ever happen. I don't think it will anytime soon.
I think they should make it a female league, just like the WNBA.
That is a good idea.  Did you know that there is only one left handed QB in the NFL and he is the only one?
I did not.  I wonder why the NFL produced only one?
Yes, Kellan Moore is one of the winners of the Superbowl and the only african american to have done so.
Oh wow, did you know that the huddle was originally invented for a deaf quarterback?
Nice beginning to the huddle!
Paul D Hubbard.  Baker Mayfield.
Cool.  I do not.  It was nice talking to you!  Have a good one.
Hello, how are you today?
Good!  Did you watch the NFL playoffs this weekend?  The 6 week schedule is completed and the NFL's playoffs will be over soon.
Absolutely!  I love football!
Yup, I do!  I guess it is just a single elimination tournament, so if your favorite team is the Ravens you can get eliminated!  Who was your favorite to get eliminated?
That is wild!  Did you know the NFL has no written rule against female players?  Women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements.  There is no written rules against women, but women would not in fact been allowed to play in the NFL if they did not meet the league'ts eligibility requirements...
I think there is a kicker, but I don't know.  Did you know they use tracking chips in pads to record the player's moves?
Yea they put microchips in a lot of stuff these days
They are supposed to track the player's moves, ball velocity and rotation.
An average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
That's crazy, I can believe that! The first NFL playoff game was played in 1932 and it was the very next year.
Wow,  I did not know that.
Yup, they played on a 20 yard log dirt field.
The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earning of an average MLB player. and an NFL player.and now lol.
That doesn't surprise me. Professional athletes have a long way to go before they can really be a professional athletes.  Matt Patricia, the rocket scientist is a nice fall back career.  He could play football as long as he didn't get too old, like Matt Patricia.
That is true.  Interesting.
I graduated from a school whose fight song includes some trigonometry terms.
Did you know that according to Canadian law, all radios are required to have at least 40% of the music played be Canadian?
That is strange for a democracy. There is a radio station that translates solar activity into sound and there is another radio station  that translates it into sound.
No I did not.  I wonder if I have heard that before?  Its been good talking to you.
You too, I hope you have a nice evening!
Thanks you too! You too!
Hi.  Did you know that there was a deaf quarterback who could not huddle with the other team in the huddle?  I guess he could not block out the other's hand signals.  I wonder who got the block.
Thats an interesting fact! I did not know that! I enjoy football, but I don't get into the NFL much. Do you enjoy football?
I do like football. I can tolerate a little of the NFL, but I think it's crazy there is only one left-handed quarterback that plays in the NFL. Is it an advantage? A advantage to the left- handed quarterback that's plays?
I wonder if that is because he's not recognized as one, I know that the NFL is one of the four major sport leagues in North America and I think the NFL does a decent job at being recognized as such.
It's true, on average, about 30% of people watch NFL games. But I guess it's still very successful since there is only 11 mins of actual football gameplay in a game. So, I guess that's probably why there are only 11.5 mins of actually football gameplay on an average game.
It takes a lot of dedication for that profession! They put a lot into it though. They put NFC implants into player shoulderpads and record their everymove and use that data to record plays and even the plays that never even happen. The NFL implant chips into player shoulders to record every move to help with understanding football and the player.
Thats kind of creepy, but I guess it's good to know that they're going to start tracking normal people in real life and start trackingnormal people. I mean, they're getting interesting stats and stuff, I wonder if they'll ever apply it to real life.
I agree that is interesting and I don't agree with them tracking normal people. What is your opinion on tracking normalpeople? I think it is interesting they can track velocity, rotation, ball speed and location, but what about data on how they track velocity? If they implemented it they can measure the rotation, velocity, and ball speed, but how do they track rotation, where do they get the data?
I think it's stupid that New Orleans cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as players.  It's a case of sexual harrasment.
The NFL's problem is not the New Orleans Saints problem, but the fact that the NFL has no written rule against female players.
That's wild, it's also crazy that the average engineer makes more in a lifetime than the average NFL player.  If that were reversed, the average Engineer makes more than the Average NFL player over their lifetime.  I think I'd like to see a female player.
I think the average engineer is probably more active than the average NFL player, but the average player is active when the average Engineer is not.  The average NFL players are active when they are not active.
True. But at what age do NFL players usually retire? I think their brains potentially have so many impacts that they may have problems with their joints from the impacts.
It takes a toll on them all, even with 11 minutes of gameplay, it can result in severe injuries in the first minutes and result insevere injuries
I get bored watching football. It's literally just a drag with no action happening in the game. They don't even have timeouts, and they drag on forever with no timeouts. There is a lot of time between the end of the start and the start of the game, espeically if there are no time outs.
Speaking of football, are you familiar with Alex Smith of the Redskins?
I have never heard of him, but I know a lot about football.  How about you?
He is a rookie in the NFL league. The Red skins have another ear of running backs coming out I feel will lead to a better NFL league in the future.
Interesting.  They put the tracking chips in him now so that they can study his moves and try to make sure he's not going to improve too much.  Do they put thetracking chips in his moves so that way they can make sure that he's actually doing what he's supposed to do?
I agree! His real weakness is his pass game to running the ball, he has a good way of getting around protections but he is not well versed in the pass game, I think.
I wonder if Alex Smith will be the last left handed quarterback, I can see the appeal, there's no advantage in having a left handed QB, but maybe Alex Smith has the appeal.
Hello, do you follow the NFL?
I watch the superbowl every year, how about you?
I watch the superbowl and the beginning of the next month.
Yes, it was a lot of fun, we are a big group and we won a lot, happy for a lot Of money, but it's a big workplace. It's interesting that they have an idea to put chips in the shoulder pads of the players and they have won a whole lot of money for that idea.
Very interesting I agree, specially since the chip is used for the cool stats that the football alos has, football has so much technology in it, and this chip must be very interesting I think,  so many cool stats from it all.
I was wondering if you ever hear the sounds from Jupiter on the radio, there is a radio station you can hear theSounds from Jupiter in the AM radio station
I didnt know that, that would be amazing to tune into a radio and listen to the radio storms there!
I heard about that.  I had no idea they could do that. I also heard that foxhole radios can be made out of razorblades and pencils, so interesting.  Have you ever seen one?
I bet that chaged lifes back in war, you can hear the news in the latin news broadcast sation, I bet that's chaged Life in WW2
That's interesting!  I guess I should listen for that.  I wonder if they have radio stations or music that can pick up latin?  I would be listening to the best radio in the world.
I head pandora radio is a great service, do you subscribe to it or head pandor radio?
I do not, I just listen online or through the app but I like simple radio, do you listen online?
I dont know about the app, I dont really use the app
I do not, I just use the pandora app, but I have many other music apps to listen to.
I guess I have Spotify, I guess I am a greay for the radio segment of the radio.
Yeah, that's very interesting.  I wonder if they played football.  The circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback, because he wasn't a big enough person to say "I don't know" in football when he played.  That's why the circular huddled was created.
It is a dangerous game and a good thing there is protection from the defensive line, its a good way to have protection in a dangerousgame
Yeah, they have some sort of chips in the players helmets, I wonder if that is a real thing, or just some sortof chips in one of the players helmet, I think they use those for concussions.
I think so. I think that it will help in the long run but the impact of hits and the consequences of those impacts can be serious, and there will be consequences in the short run.
Yes, tracking the players movements through their shoulder pads is so important. I'm not surprised they are tracking it through the shoulder pads.
They should be changing the rules in order to protect players more with all that tech that they are working on.  It would help to protect them and I think they are changing therules in order for that.
Hello - how are you today? Do you listen to the radio at all?
I don't know much about listening. It's confusing how it works. I know it uses energy. It uses radio waves. It is all about energy.
Yes, and the information is transmitted by shifting amplitude and frequency.
Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up on AM radio.
That's really cool! I wonder what they sound like. Makes sense though because each storm is basically a giant burst of energy.. it makes sense
I have no idea!  I prefer to listen to a Finnish program that broadcasts in Latin, though.
That is an oddity, it must not exist in Finland.  I wonder how many listeners there are for a program in latin?
Probably not that many if any. There's a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio drama. I wonder how many.
I doubt it.  I bet it is on the internet.  But if I had to check it out I would probably check it for old radio shows.  Radio shows have their own charm, no doubt.
I would love to hear War of the Worlds. It is a timeless classic.
That is a classic!  I havent listened to it but i know people are really scared.. and scared. strange.
I can't believe WWII soldiers were able to make a radio out of a pencil and a razorblade with the time they had to make one out of an old pencil and an old razorblade.
I guess those guys had enough incentive to put it in the foxhole! I wonder if anyone was listening to the news in latin though lol I don't think I could do that. I could get away with listening to news in Latin though lol.
No doubt! I wonder if they are listening to Canadian music, since radio stations there have to play 40% of their music in Canadian.
Yeah, I guess the US govt needs to protect its artists, but canada knows rush and neil young songs by heart.
I'm ready for football to start. Do you watch the NFL?
I watch the super bowl but I don't get into it as much as I used to. Did you watch the Super Bowl?
I am a fan, as a kid i wanted to become a pro player but now women are allowed so as a fan I am.
I wonder if women could make it in the game. anyway, great chat!
I think they could survive, although there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in the whole game.
I dont think I could survive 11 minutes of mortal combat, but I could definitely survive the first 10.  Have a good day!
You have a great day too!
Hello,  did you know that Jupiter has a radio storm that you can pick up on your regular AM radio?  I can't get it on my AM radio though.
That's interesting! I wonder what they can hear? I wonder if they can be translated into sounds like music? I know that the sun's solar activity can be converted into sounds, but what does that mean?
I didn't know that.  Did you know that Canadian law requires 40% of music to be of Canadian origin?  That is why Canadian law asks for 40% to be Canadian origin.
Nope I didn't know that!
I don't know, I think Canadian radio is probably not very good haha, I know the music on the Canadian radio doesn't seem to be very good, but that's just my experience
I'm interested in football history and the Super Bowl coming up. I'm really looking forward to it. I think I'd go back to see the original first NFL playoff game from back in 1932.
I'm not really but to be honest I kind of thought that playoff games happened earlier than that, I think the highest scoring football game was 222-0 I can't remember what teams were playing but it was wild, to be Honest I kindof thought that Playoff games happened much earlier than then and I don't remember if the highestscoring football game ever was or if the teams were even playing.
Wow, I know right, it must have been a boring game today. The game is so technologically involved though, they have tracking chips in the players moves, etc. and monitor the ball speed, etc., and the players own tracking chips.
That is crazy! It's wild how far we've come. The circular huddle was developed by a deaf quarterback so the other teams couldn't read his hands signing. I wonder how the circular huddles were developed?
That is very interesting, the offensive line used to call the plays, now they just call the play and go to the offensiveline to initiate the play
That is such a great question, I wonder if they call an audible, or what play they decided to use the huddle for, or if that is just one play they decide to use.
He was definitely a mastermind. He was a major major on the field, controlling so many plays.Did you know that Russell Wilson, one of the good QBs in football today, used to be a major league baseball player? He was actually quite the mastermind, too.
I didn't know that!  I kind of playled that one back in the day.  I do know that Baker Mayfield could beat his entire college and then some by amaizing at Halo 3.  He's kind of playedled to be the next QB to do that.
I didn't know that Baker Mayfield could do well in Halo 3.  I wonder how much he's compared to Brett Favre and John Elway.  He's in the limelight right now and he's only compared to Russell Wilson, Brett FavRE and John Elkway.
I don't follow football much at this point, so I don't know if I would consider Baker a professional player at thispoint.  I used to follow it a lot when I was younger though, and I pretty much know a lot about it from videogames.
Yes he is a very young player. he is only in his 4s year but has a lot of hype, he plays for the Cleveland Browns and he has a whole lot of it, he is the #2 overall pick in the 2015 draft, he was the #1 overall selection that year
Haha, I'm curious to know more. I was thinking about what you said about him and that he doesn't play video games, I was going to say that I don't play piano either, I used to play piano but I gave up videogames a couple of years ago at this point, so I'm not sure if you've heard of Halo 3 yet, I've heard the name and am curious to see how it goes. Have you heard of halo 3, I gave it up a while ago, I think it's a couple years old at this very point, but I don not know.
I love piano music and struggle to play the notes, but I can read music and Struggle to play it. I don't play video games but I play video video games online.
ya I can read music and I stopped playing because I realized that I was missing out on half the battle haha, I wish I could read music, that would be half thebattle haha, you would think with all the skill I have from the time I put into video games, I would have more skill by now, but I can't I just stopped playing and now I can only read about half of it, you know, I never really realized that
Reading music is a thing, it is like making your own fingers go through the road instead of just making them.  I would not chose that if I were reading music.  Great talking to you, sharing with you what I chose to do.  Thanks for sharing.
It was great talking with you as well, I wish you good luck with your music career and if you learn to play you can do so at any age and at any time, great talking to you too, and good luck to you with your Music career
Hi, do you like football?
I do, I played it in college and the NFL and I'm a Chiefs fan.  I've played since I was 18.
Nice!  Football isn't for everyone though, I guess.  The average NFL has only 11 minutes of live gameplay.
I know right, that is so short! I was wondering that too. I wonder if it is true that the nfl has no rules against women playing in the nFl, I know there are no rulesagainst women playing,
It seems like there has never been a woman player before. I wonder why not.
I think maybe a kicker? maybe a starting one, maybe a few chips in the chips for a kicker.
I heard that too, for footballs and shoulder pads and such.
Yes!  A far cry from making a radio from razor blades and pencils like the soldiers did in WW2.  That's admirable!
I would love to learn how to make one as well. I also would love the way to pick up Jupiter storms on the radio. I've heard that they can be picked up on AM radio.
I'm not sure, Jupiter must be really powerful to be able to do that, but I'm not so sure it would pick up Canada, since 40% of the music is guaranteed to be Canadian.
Haha, I wonder what's missing from that 40% Canadian music?  I would think that Drake, Justin Bieber and Celine Dion would be some of that 40%, but who knows.  It's probably just Justin Bieber.
Sarah Mclaughlin is Canadian and she is great. I think that is interesting.  I wonder if Sarah Mclaughn also does classic radio dramas, there is a website for those.
Yes.  I wonder how much it would cost.
Not sure. I know Alex Smith quizzed out of college and got tuition paid for the first four years of college, so it was free. Speaking of free, did you know that Alex Smith quizeed out of his first two years of university for free?
He started working on his master's degree before being the first overall pick in the 2000 NFL draft.  Good for him!  Always have a backup plan.
No kidding.  He's pretty good.  Do you remember the circular huddle they had with the Chiefs in the past?  No idea if it was because there was a deaf QB or if it's because of the idea of it.
Yeah, it is interesting. I wonder how they got the other team to read his hand signals.
Times have changed.  I can't believe Baker Mayfield's plight.  He's deciding between going back to play football or compete with video games.
I guess professional video gaming is more lucrative.  He claimed to be able to beat the whole university on Halo 3, he said he beat them all.
I didn't realize it pays that much. I'm wondering if it pays as much as the NFL. In the gaming world, engineers make more than the average NFL player but in the long run, I'm sure. I wonder how much engineers make than theaverage NFL player, I wonder if that is the same in the gamingWorld.
I know that engineers manage their money better than professional sports players. I think that football players don't terribly terribly well at this time and don't have the time to do it. I was interested in the facts about how Tom Brady did in school. Do you know anything about him?
Hello, do you like football?
I am a big fan of the NFL.  I like to fall watching the league get whittled down to 32 teams and see who is the ultimate winner, then fall watching all 32 teams together, great fun.
Alex Smith is the QB who entered college as a junior. He took so many AP tests that he became a junior!
Yes, and he is still working on his masters and is still getting drafted.
That is awesome! Love that he got his education before becoming one of those high paid proffessionals.
In reality an engineer will make more over their lifetime than an NFL player in the US.
Yeah, they make soooo much more but they also can't control their finances correctly, so they don't make as much if they don not control their money
True! There's only 11 minutes of gameplay a week!
Yeah, lol, but yeah there is quite a bit of action.  It is crazy how many fans sit through it though.  I mean, it takes like three to four hours for just a little bit ofAction, lol!
I think it would be interesting to see if there are female players in the game.  It would make it a little more interesting.
There has never been a female kicker in the league though, has there?
I think the Saints are still pretty anti-women though, right?
I don't understand in todays day why they would be.
The cheerleaders have to continue eating in the restaurant when players come in but not continue eating.
Yes I agree. and they have to leave if they make you want to leave
It would make more sense than the tracking chips they are used in now, I bet they have one in every game all the time.
I wonder when all the other sports will start using those tracking chips.
I'm not sure, but I think soccer has it working now so that could be really helpful.
Yes I think so too. It's crazy Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback.
I know.  Baseball has many lefty pitchers.  That's strange.
True.  Anyway, great chat!  Have a good one!
Hello! How are you?
I'm great!  How are you?  Do you like Alex Smith?
I like him, I played in Kansas City.
Yeah, he is good but he is on the Redskins now, and he is not very good.
Good for him!  Crazy that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live game play!
Yes it seems like a lot longer.  I hear they use tracking chips players have on their shoulders.
Yea, I wonder how long as Brady and the others are able to deflate the trackers so that they can put them in footballs? They can deflate it, but how do they deflate them? Are they the same way they deflate the tracker in the footballs that is why they put them there?
I would have guessed they designed them keepin' that in mind lol, cool stats though, they track every move on the field, they have chips in the shoulder of the players as well so they can track everymove on the playing field, I would have never guessed they would do that.
That's funny! Did you know that Saints players are forbidden from eating at the same restaurants as their cheerleaders?  I wonder what they do?  Cheerleaders for the saints players are barred from eating in the same restaurant as the cheerleaders.
That rule makes me so mad at the NFL, especially Coach Matt Patricia.
No I don't. Who is he?
He is a rocket scientist and a coach in the NFL, a very smart man, he is also the first coach in a league,
Interesting.  I also see that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than football players.  The average lifetime earning of a engineer isHigher than football Players.
Yeah apparently they earn more but they get brain damage and other injuries from the sport and the sport so that's why yeah apparently they do well
True. Did you know Jupiter has radio storms so strong you can hear them on the radio?
No I didnt know that.  I wonder what happens to the storms?  Do you listen to the radio a lot?
No not anymore, but I used to when I lived in Canada, where you are required to have 40% of all music played in Canadian.  I think it is still played in 40% or more.
That's a good law, it promotes local talent, a lot of good artists have benefit from it, its also great that its a law, its a good Law, a good artists has benefit from that law and it promotes the US talent
True. Do you listen to the radio a lot?
I do sometimes, on the way to work, I listen to a radio station that translates solar activity into sound, but I know it is boring.  But there is a radio stations that translates radio activity into sounds, I wonder what they sound like.
That's crazy! Nice chatting with you!
It works well on the radio just amazes me.  It's been nice chatting with you as well.  Have a good evening!
Do you follow the NFL?
I follow the NFL from time to time. I watch the super bowl. You?
I never get the chance to watch it. I heard it was a snore-fest. I figured that Tom Brady and the Pats would win. I always figured that.
Yeah it was, it was pretty boring, it wasn't much of a surprise that it was the Super Bowl lol, the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay, so yeah, not a surprise there was only 11 minutes in this Super Bowl, an average nfl game has only 11 hours and 15 minutes ofLive gameplay
I know, but there's plenty of time for commercials, too. The NFL guys get paid a lot more than basketball, on a per-minute basis, but on a minute/minute basis I'd say basketball has more than 11 minutes. I prefer games with flow, and games with time for commercial's, too, but the NFL guys are paid a ton, too!
Yeah I agree.  It's crazy that the kind of technology exist on the field to get such good stats.  I wonder if they use tracking chips or something.  They say they have tracking chips in the field.  Do you think those kind oftechnology exist?
They are good for understanding the flow of the game. they help understand situations that lead to injury and concussion. player safety is important.
Yep I agree, and hopefully that will help prevent the brain injuries that do happen. I hope they use the stats of the New Orleans Saints to help treat their cheerleaders better, they seem to be doing their best to prevent theBrain injuries and I hope that changes
The cheerleaders are at the bottom of the totem pole.  Long hours, low pay, low wages, and no respect.  No respect at all.
I don't respect them at all. I think they need respect in the past, too. I know that there is a rule that says they have to leave a restaurant if a player enters. It's a weird relic from the 70s where teams didn't have any teams and now there is such a rule, I think it's a relic of the past.
I think the saints have a problem with relations between players and cheerleaders to create a rule like that. They don't want them partying too much.
Yeah that makes sense. It's interesting though that they don't have a rule for female players on the team. I've heard that there is no rule for male players but apparently there is a rule against female players. That's interesting.
I never imagined that women would be able to play, but I guess there is no rule against it in most sports. I wonder why there is not a rule against that, though.
Yeah that makes sense, I think it's wrong that they can't just let women can play basketball, I mean the NBA is for men so it makes sense. Who is your favorite quarterback in the NBA?
I like Joe Montana and Steve Young.  The NBA is too good. I like money more than money.  But I have a favorite QB in the NBA, Joe Montana.
I like those guys too, I like Tom Brady personally, I think he does some weird and sometimes weird things like the fact that he's never eaten a strawberry before LOL, a lot of people don't like Baker Mayfield, he's the only QB who's never even eaten a Strawberry before lol
Is Brady a vegan? Is Brady a Vegan? Is Baker Mayfield a Vegan too? Is it an allergy to strawberries?
Yeah I don't know him either but I do know he used to be a pro gamer. He was a quarterback for University of Oklahoma and was a major gamer and a pro football player. He used to actually become really good at Halo 3 which I guess is a game back in the day haha, I guess he was really good, he was the best at the game and also was a Quarterback for University and was actually a progamer.
I guess he could have been a great QB in the NFL, or a gamer, he could meet people and make cash, and if you can make money being a gamer is a great way to meet people, and make money,
Yep I agree, I could make money off of playing video games LOL, I would like to make money in the NFL as well, did you know the circular huddle is from the story behind the circular Huddle?
Yes, the deaf QB wanted to shield his hand signals for the other team. I'm surprised that someone with that skill can play the game. In fact, I'm not surprised that any QB with that Skill could play for a team. Guess I'll have to look into it. Well, I enjoyed chatting with you!
I wonder if they were making him use signs to let him read the plays or if they wanted him to keep making them. The circular huddle is genius. I think it helps him read all the signs. Have a great night.
Good morning!  Are you a football fan?
I am a football fan!  It is a great sport, one of the teams two devision in the US, its a great sports, what about you?
Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL?
I did not know that. I think that is great for the league.
Yes, Baker Mayfield is a backup QB for the Browns who was a first time competitive gaming QB.  He quit football to pursue full time competitivegaming.  Sounds like a gamble to me but not a risky one.  Scary to think he would quit football for that.
Yeah gaming doesnt seem like the best industry or career path for him,  pro football players are so rich they can earn more money in another industry or job that could earn them more money.
Definitely.  It pays better than the average NFL or MLB player, but over their lifetime an engineer's ears will be better than an average NFL/MLB player, so definately not.
That makes sense, engineers work for a longer time so they hear for a much longer time, Alex Smith is a great role model to follow, he seems like a great example, engineers are the best,
No, I did not hear about him. What is his name?
He took a AP test in high school and entered university as a Ujunior, received a degree in two years and then began working on a masters degree in three years and a masters' degree, he began working in his later years, he received a Degree in two year and then received a Masters Degree in three.
Nice!  That's good for him.  The circular huddle was created by a deaf QB so that other players could read his hand signals.
I bet he didnt have to do that, teams had to come up with a way to do it and he implemented the strategy, he left a legacy behind, I bet he doesnt even mind if others do, he did it for the best of the teams,
Probably not, I guess. I wonder if there will be a female NFL player any time soon though, they've written no rule against female players.
I think females would definitely be at a disadvantage.
I know, I am thinking they are too, but imagine if they were a punter, punter or a kicker who could take hits, imagine how many hits they would take?
Yeah, I guess those are good positions to be in.  I would like to see that happen some day.
Did you know that tracking chips are now in all their shoulder pads and on the field so they can record every move.  They can also track them in the shoulder pads as well.
That seems a bit invasive to me, but I guess all kinds of stats can be kept with those chips.
I think they also use the chips in the footballs to track velocity and other technical details about the sport.
Who is your favorite team?
I do, I like the Steelers, what about you?
The patriots are another great team mine too, they share a record with the Steelers, and they also have a great teamMine too!
Are you a football fan?
I love ronaldo and messi
I like American football, especially the Bengals' loss Sunday.  Do you like it?
Naah, I didn't. I was cheering for them.
I was for the Bengals.  I think Dalton is so important to the Bengals, but I think he was caught up in his thumb injury that ended his season.  He was on the radio saying that he had a thumb injury, but it was on him and not the Bengals!
Yeah, I can believe that, lol. It's like the evolution of a quarterback, thumbs are so important to the evolution, lol! But hey he's still got the thumbs to make the touchdown pass!
I wonder if it's time for a woman to step in?  There is no official prohibition against women quarterbacks in the NFL.  I wonder if there will be a woman quarterback soon.  There's no official ban but there's an official prohibition Against Women Quarterbacks!
That is a good idea, but I don't know if they would be physically ready for it.
They are not. There is only 11 minutes of live gameplay and they rub it in. If it was 24 hours straight and they had 2 hours and 20 minutes oflive gameplay they would probably be benching them.
I guess I am afraid they are copying the subjects of the article, they will reject our work, I would be afraid they will not like the actual conversation and they will just reject the article.
I'm not.  I guess the Bengals want to start Driskel.  They want to keep discussing football in the article.
I guess you missed that question.  You asked if the women are ready for it physically.  The game is not over yet but I think the women's are.
I think they are not yet, possibly because they have to protect their thumbs so they can't get injured or anything like that.
The game is a risk with so much money invested in the game.  There's always risk, but the risk is not as strong or fast as in the field.  I wonder if women would be better off with the money invested.
Maybe if a woman could meet the eligibility requirements.
If a woman could become the investors of the team they invested millions of dollars, if a woman was on the team it could be the team that became the team and they invested Millions of dollars.
I think the novelty would work.  The average NFL player doesn't work out.  An engineer earns more money over his lifetime than the top 3 top NFL players.  Did you know that an engineer earns twice as much as the average NFLplayer in a lifetime?
I think I know the numbers on that, I am an engineer, and I know how hard it is to make more than what NFL players earn, but it's hard to believe the numbers.
Yes.  I think the NFL earns the giant paydays as long as they play well, as long they don't do activism and lose money.  Colin Kapernick, who was kicked out earlier, did some activism and losing money so the NFL doesn't like him, and he got kicked out.
Kapernick better start training to be an engineer. I guess he could be an Engineer.
That would be some good money!
Do you know who Eli Manning is?
I think he is a nice guy, had a long and pretty good career until recently and a nice person.
I wonder what his replacement will do. Kyle Lauletta seems to be in trouble. He's a cop who is running into some things.
Wow, did not hear about that, what was he charged with, and who was charged?
I'm not sure, but I know that it happened in the giants, it only happened in two days
Yeah I know right, they fell off a lot in the last few years, I think their performance has been out of the 70's and 80's. Do you enjoy football?
I do, but I have limited experience.  I like the alternative, the Giants.  The Giants have a 19 year old Alex tanney that has only been in the league a few weeks.
Yes, I have heard of him.  Did you know he was the one that tried to bring the team back?
He is a good man and a good person, nice to see Barkley stick by him, Lauletta arrest was just to let barkley stick it to him
He is a representative of the character, he is speaking out about his mistake and he was familiar with Alex Smith and his character, which is very representative.
Yeah I know that guy, smart guy.  He started college as a junior and took so many AP tests that he became a junior.
That is impressive.  He is still working on his master's so he could be drafted.
I think it's odd that Kellan Moore is one of only two left-handed pitchers in MLB, but not in nfl. There are only 1 left- handed pitchers in mlb
Wow. I remember when I was like 6, I couldn't even remember who could throw with a left hand!
It started because of a deaf QB who did that.  The other team couldn't read his hand signals.  Now the circular huddle is common.  I don't know why.  It helps the other team to not read hisHand signals.
I wonder what it is like to be deaf. It must be difficult to be a deaf QB. You can't hear play calls in your helmet or get sacked. You have to hear them from the helmet and then you can't get sacked!
Maybe.  I saw that in WW2 soldiers made radios out of razor blades and pencils.  Long time ago.
I had no idea you could make a radio like that.
Yes, I did not either. I might end up cutting myself now. Back to football, the NFL is trying to get some women into it. There are no rules against women playing in the NFL. That would be interesting to see if they end up cut the rules against men and ladies.
I agree.  I think there is a size difference, and there is no reason why they cannot play.  No one would be able to play because of the size difference.
Thanks for the chat.  I have to get going.
I was very disappointed to hear about Kyle Lauletta's arrest, how about you?
Yes.    What happened?
He ran a police officer over with his car in New York City.
He is pretty resistant and disresptectful.
I heard that and am glad to hear that he gave them a hard time for it too.  Now that you mention it he did seem intoxicated when he gave up. I am glad he didn't go in while intoxicated though.
I think it was more for discipline with the Giants.
I know the team has their hands a little bit tied now, they have no options for quarterback, they really only have two options for Quarterback so their hands are a bit tied there
I was hoping that the Giants would put up with Eli and keep him, hoping that he would play well.
Eli is only 30 years old. He can still do it.
It doesn't surprise me that the Giants are doing well considering they were doing poorly this year.
Yes, the record is terrible, it is not.
I don't understand why OBJ isn't frustrated.
I hope he can get better this week, I think.
Yes, the coach and Eli are both very talented players in my opinion, but it's time for a change of coach and players
Agreed. I think the team needs to go, especially since Lauletta is under arrest and not on the team.
He deserves a chance to play.
He could not be worse than a Tanney.  He is the best option right now.
They probably saved his job by the fact that they won the first couple of games. Eli's job could have been saved if they had won the last couple of game.
I am not surprised when he retires.
He's considered one of the best of all time.  I'm not a big fan, but he's still a good QB and he still wins.
I was a fan too but I think it is time for a fresh talent. I think its time for another fresh talent to take over.
lol, well I hope they lose this week.
What is an important plater for you in your football team?
I think the QB is the most important player, he calls the most plays and touches the ball on almost every offensive play, he is the one that calls the first plays and Touchdowns for every offensive plays and touchdowns.
Yeah he is involved in every offensive play and is protected by a good offensive line.
Very true.  I think that's right.
What do you think of Tom Brady?
Yes, the New England Patriots quarterback who used to be the GOAT!
Yeah the goat, rooster, hall of famer, and he was a high school team.  His coach didnt like him and the team lost a lot of games so he went to the bench and he became the QB and yeah the goat became the Hall of Famer and his team lost.  the coach didnt even know he was the QB, he was on the bench from the bench,
He was a fool! I bet people still make fun of him to this day.  I wonder what the coach did to look like a fool?
I agree, the guy wouldnt recognize talent on his own team, I bet he regrets not putting Brady on the team, now he will face the same face of having him hit by a hit from a QB, I sure bet he regretted not putting him there.
On another note, Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and picked up by AM radio. I have heard that before.
no I didnt know that, I wonder if there is a station that has that station, radio is a great invention, I think it is such a great inventions.
I read in Canada that it's a law that 40% of the music played has to be Canadian.  I have never heard that but I wonder why that is.  Is it because of the law or something else?
I havent heard about that, but I think thats a fair way to promote local talent. there is a very talented artist in canada, I think it is ok that the law was taken out of the way to help promote them.
I honestly can't name any.  I think it's Justin Bieber, Shania Twain, Shaina Twain, and Celine Dion.  LOL.
Yeah I think Drake is one of them, I bet a couple more lol.  I also think that there is a cool site with drama episodes for free.  Drake must be in there somewhere. I bet it is a really cool site.  It is a site with Drama episodes for FREE!
lol, I have never heard of that site, I wonder if it is free or not lol, I like classic radio dramas and would like to listen to those for free, thats how I spend my spare time, I spend most of my spare Time lol,
Me too!  The radio can be a bit boring. I would like to try the latin news channel that has a latin News channel though.
LOL. I wonder how many listeners they have.
I think its popular enough to have many fans, the 70's show must have been popular too
Thank goodness it is!  It has been on for so long!
yeah sounds boring, I dont understand a word of latin.
hi, do you like football?
I do like it. I would rather go to live games than watch it on the radio. I do like to listen to the radio more than live games though.
I do like to listen to it, I usually listen to the internet. What about you?
I do too.  It is fascinating how the internet is a technology used by radio and TV to carry information and sound.  Radio is a radio technology that systematically uses sound waves to carry sound and systematically use properties of electromagnetic energy waves such as frequency, amplitude, width, width of phase, phase change, and amplitude modulation to transmit sound. Radio waves are electromagnetic energy transmitted through space and space through radio waves.
Did you know Kellan moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL?
No.  That's unusual.   Baker Mayfield, the former OU QB, considered quitting football while in school to pursue competitive gaming and beat everyone at his school, University of Oklahoma.  He claims to have beat almost everyone in Halo 3 and considered quitting to pursue full-time competitive gaming.
I was not aware of that.  I also did not know that the NFL puts chips in players shoulder pads.
I was not but they put tracking chips inside the football so that they can track the players moves.
That is pretty cool that they can get that information that way.
They use chips inside the ball to track velocity, ball speed, time, rotation, rotation and location, and they track velocity all the time. They use it to give the players more game information. The coaches use it during games to tell the players what to do and how to play better. It's automated.
Do you listen to the radio?
Everytime I go in my car, I listen to Pandora. I like it because I can listen to all kinds of different kinds of music depending on my mood and playlist. I've even heard of a Finnish radio station that has a special "Nuntii Latini" radio station which has classical Latin music on the radio everytime.
I wonder how soldiers were able to build them with a pencil and razorblade?  I wonder if soldiers used them to build the first ones?
Apparently they were called foxhole radios.  I did learn that the pencil was the diode and the razor blade was the "welcome" diode.  What did they use a pencil for?  How did they learn?
I wonder if you can hear Jupiter radio songs through them, I wonder if they have that?
No, I didn't know that. Did you know that the radio storms are so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an AM radio? I wonder if the radio Storms are that strong?
Interesting, I have never heard of that. What is it?
I have heard of them.  There is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.  It is a pleasure.
Interesting, I'm not a huge fan of classic radio dramas but I have tried it before!
Interesting. I will have to investigate old school ones. I think its cool that the circular huddle used in football is created by Paul D. Hubbard, a deaf QB who didn't want the other team to read his hand signals, no matter how he was saying them. It is cool that a deaf quarterback could think of a way to use it, no mater what the hand signals were.
That is interesting. Nice chatting with you!
Same here, have a good one.
Hello!  Do you watch football?
I do. I like the halftime shows. Joe Namath is my favorite.
Haha, mine too, I'm watching half time now!
I hear Kellan Moore is the sole left-handed QB in the NFL, the sole one.
Yeah, I was in fact surprised to know that, I thought there was more left handed quarterbacks, I always thought there were more right handed quarterbacks
Huh. The huddle was developed at the Notre Dame by a deaf QB.  I gathered that from a movie I saw about him.  The huddles were used because he was deaf and couldn't get the hand signals for plays.  It was the same way that the huddle is used at the H.O.R.L.E. at Notre Dame.
That does sound a bit odd.  You would think that they would want to avoid your calls being heard by the other team.  It works wonderfully though, it works wonderfully.
I agree, I heard it was a bit early but I think it is better than Favre or Elway.  I think Mayfield could have done better, I like him better.
F Favre was a touch worried about his potential, but his attitude and his potential are there.
Lots of entitlement and he doesn't seem to be a leader of the offensive team or a leader on the offensive.
Yes, a quarterback is the QB for an NFL team.  No easy task for them.  They need to have football skill in addition to having leadership skill in plus.
I heard that he only threw a touch down pass once.
Yeah, Nick Fole, the quarterback of Philadelphia Eagle, was in the Super Bowl last year.
Wow!  Radio is a really good medium to follow a football game, it's a good medium
I agree it is very boring and I do not follow this game, I don't think I could follow this.  Btw, btw, did you know soldiers in WWII used a razorblade and pencil to make a radio.
I didn't know that!  I heard that in 1948 a Bing Crosby song filled more than half the radio time for recorded music.  I wonder if he was right about that.  In 1948 a Bing Crosby songfilled more than 40% of radio time.
No clue whatsoever.  Btw, did you know that in fact, a Jupiter radio storm can be pick up signal on an AM radio?  I don't know how they pick up that signal though.
I did not know that. I would like to listen to the radio station that translates solar activity into sound and listen to some of the sun's music live.
I think that technology enables us to do some fascinating things.  I hope it allows us to live in the future.  We can even live on the Moon, if technology enables it.
I think playing in zero gravity might help in the NFL, but not sure.
Btw, it was nice chatting with you, enjoy your holiday.
Hey, you too! Thanks!
Bye!  I will look into it!
bye! ;) Bye! ;)
Bye!  You too.
See you soon!  I don't think we'll be seeing each other anymore.
Hello,  are you into the NFL?  Is Aaron Rodgers the highest paid player in the NFL.
Aaron Rodgers is the best.  He missed nine games last year because of a broken collar bone.  But he made $12 million dollars this year.  I think he'll make $15 million dollars in 2018 because he missed nine game this year with a brokencollar bone.
I didnt know that, I wonder what he is going to make after that, he will make 32 million in his next two seasons a sweet bonus,
That's crazy.  I would love that kind of dough!
I would love it too! That's a lot of money! I would settle for a lot more workout bounus lol.
yeah, and he beat out matt ryan as highest paid player in NFL, the Falcons got him for only $10 mil for the Ryan deal and he got 32 mil for it, he beat him out.
Wow, that is a lot of money! I think he was a great choice though, he chosen the 49ers over the packers, a great Choice.
I think Green Bay is doing well with him, he has a contract for his entire career.
He has a deal for $32 million dollars that is guaranteed, so he will get that.
That is great!  I like ESPN, but I think they are flippant about it on the radio.  They say, "ESPN is just being flippancy."  lol
That is a great way to say it!  I like that phrase lol.  I think Brett Favre had a chance to be the next Rodgers, but he had to wait until the last two seasons to get a chance.  Now Rodgers is done, I think he will be great.
Green Bay has a good record and he is the MVP and was a first pick so they have a good track record. He will be the next MVP.
Another great player is Kirk Cousins. He rejected the option to join the Vikings for $32 million. He would have been a great player.
wow,  thats really?  Baker Mayfield almost quit football to be a professional gamer,  lol I wonder why?
Lol, no i didnt know about that, good thing he stayed in football
He was in college ball, but apparently he is really good at Halo lol.  He is really really good!
I wonder if gamers make as much money as pro football players? lol. Alex Smith says that gamers make almost as muchmoney as pro players.
I know who he is, he is on the Redskins right?
Yeah, he took so many ap tests in highschool and took so much AP tests in High school that he took ap years.
Wow, smart dude.  I read somewhere that an engineer makes more than a football player over the lifetime, I guess he must be a really smart dude then.  A degree in an engineering or a football players degree is more than I would ever read!
I bet he is, smart guy, he has a masters degree in something related to engineering, I wonder how he got it, it must be related to Engineering.
do you like the NFL?
I do! Did you hear about them placing chips in the players?
Yes they are, I can't imagine they will ever use them though, I don't think I would be playing again
It is used during the games to track velocity and rotation of the games
Nice. I think it would make the game safer as well.
Maybe. Matt Patricia was an astronaut turned coach.
Wow that is a huge career jump.
Yeah. Did you know the first NFL game was played in 1932?
Yes it was in 1916, it was only 11 minutes of gameplay though
Wow. Do you know when the first game was played?
cool. Do you like Brady?
I don't know much about him but I do know Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB that is left handed.
Cool. Brady has never started or been a backup QB since high school. I wonder why he wasn't started.
Wow they wasted a good chance to win some games there.
Yeah. Did you know Alex smith completed college all 4 years?
Oh wow, that is super fast. I did not know that. How did he manage that?
He must have taken lots of AP tests in high school, smart kid,
wow amazing. Did you know Brad Johnson is the only QB to ever throw a touchdown pass to himself? He threw one to himself and it was to Brad Johnson
That is a new thing to me.
Me either. Do you listen to the radio?
I do from time to time. How about you?
Hi there!  Are you a fan of the NFL?
I am.  My team failed to make the playoffs this year.  Which team failed?
Mine failed too.  I like the vikings as a team.
I think the east was the land of green and gold, the land in the land that is the landof green andgold, those guys have had some good games in the past. 32 was the number this year. Geez, I'm old! I'm like, geez, you guys have a few good games!
Nooo! Just kidding! Noooo! I'm from the Packers. Who is your favorite quarterback? Rodgers is my favorite quarterback.
Yeah, I'm a huge Brett Favre fan to be honest! I loved him in 2001. There were some good games, and I'm not sure if we'd have beaten the Saints that year if they weren't paying to hurt him a bit for a bit during the season to be Honest.
Favre was awesome! He was a good quarterback. Alex Smith was in the same draft class as Rodgers, and is terrible, but a good one, but not in the Same draft classAs Rodgers.
Yeah it sounds like Alex Smith is a smart guy but I thought he was crap, I never really liked him, he was always so far behind, so yeah it sounds Like Alex Smith was a really smart guy.
Yes, he took so many AP classes in high school he graduated his sophomore year and was the first overall pick in the draft!
Wow, that is impressive!  It sounds like he really wanted to do well in the field and that is really impressive, sounds like it.
I heard that in the 1960's players in the US football probably made more money than any of them.  In his lifetime he was an engineer and made more than most players.
Yeah, he could have had a lasting career if he took the risk, but at the same time, it is better to end up with a pro career than not have one at all.  It is a trade off for sure, but it seems like a risk that could end up being a lasting one.
That is a valid point. Speaking of the saints, did you hear about how they treat their cheerleaders?
Yeah, I read about it, I think they have a rule, seems a bit outdated, but I don't know if it is a rule.
Yea, it does, I don't really support it, they are fighting for it
Agreed! I wonder what the rule on female players is?
Whatttttt? I didn't know that. I think women are much more capable than they are known for.
I think there should be a system in place for the high school or college women's football teams, maybe a system for high school and college women football teams. I think it would work.
Very true.  I think they may be making one in the next couple years.  There was a female kicker that was really good in college.  She was making over $100,000 per game.  That was nice chatting with you.  You should try rooting for a female kicker!
Yeah that would be cool if a female player made a pro roster.  It was good talking to you too.  I wonder if any female player has ever made a Pro roster.
Good chatting with you as well!  I wonder if we should be supposed to know more about it?
Hi, how are you?
Hi, I am doing well.  Are you familiar with Bill Polian?  He was once a Hall of Fame executive.
I heard that he is a good quarterback, I didn't watch him play yesterday, Jackson is a really good quarterback though, did you watch him watch him plays?
No I did not. I think the other two teams played, I think one of the teams played a really young quarterback, in my opinion.
He is young but he is on track. He has a lot of work to do. He had the worst statistical game ever and is very young.
He is the starting quarterback next season
I think so.  I am not sure who will be.
Did you know that Bill Polian as general manager of the 49ers had a record of 6 straight Super Bowls with a record 5 of those with Bill PolIAN as general Manager?
I didn't know either, and four straight is the only Bills to do that.
I had no idea.  I guess I'll just focus on Pittsburgh my team is the New England Patriots.
Did you know that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of game time?  I can't believe there is only 11 minutes in the average nfl game
I did not know that!  I know the game ls hour and a half and a game can last 3 hours.
Yeah, the clock runs out after a few plays I guess, a lot of commercials, but the clock is only on for a few seconds at a time.
The quarterback for the Carolina Panthers is a quarterback.
I think Alex Smith is very good. He's very athletic and very athletic. QBs are smarter than we think. He started college as a junior and already had started college by the time he was a senior.
He is a good player, but I don't think he is the best quarterback.  I think he's a good enough player to be a QB, but he does seem to showboat.  Not sure I prefer easy going player.  Do you?
I think he works hard and is a bit of a showboat, but he is a QB so he does not have to be. he is the best.
Yes, he hid it for so long last season, even when he was hurt, and then hid it again this season.
That's admirable, not smart but not smart and probably hurt his team ultimately.
I know.  The person who did a lot for NFL in the superbowl though, polian lead the colts to the Superbowl.
Yes, making it to six straight superbowls is outstanding.  He only lost one in those six!  I can't believe he has been to so many straight superb Bowls.
Its a shame what happened to Andy Dalton
A thumb injury put him out for the rest of the season.
Yes, he was one of the best of the last few seasons.
I know. He does a good job, he and Jeff Driskel, do you like Jeff?
I would like to think so, but doubtful.  He has no experience and he is old.
I don't know. Driskel has been there and out of touch, I don't see him coming into that game.
I did not know that. I wonder if that was before or after Tom Savage?
I think he will play well, but Driskel stated that he will not play.
That's true, and he's a green back now, so he has experience in it all.
I would like the old Andy back, but I think he will start the new season, his medical team will tell us.
Yea, he's going to be great.
He has a toe injury, so he's going to be Green until he's not.
I think he is coming back this week.
The texans picked up Dalton in the draft. He was only 19 years old.
I wonder why Dalton was drafted by the bengals.
Correct. He went to UC, right?
Yep, he was the quarterback there too, right?
Dalton has only completed 50 percent of his passes, but he has completed almost 70 percent of them
I did not know that. He has been doing well this year.
He is this year? How is that possible?
I believe it was his best year in 2014.
Do you watch the NFL?
Yeah I do, my favorite team is the Chiefs, Alex Smith quizzed so well on his tests the last two years of college, do you have a favorite team?
Wow!  He was really smart, I wonder if the chiefs got him for a pick.
Mahomes is a great young QB.  I can't recall the last lefty to be in the NFL who was a left-handed like Kellan Moore was.  Do you know if he was left-hander like Kellans Moore?
Kellen Moore?  I don't know.  I know he's making a name for himself as a star QB.  lol  My favorite lefty was Michael Vick.  Did you know that?  lol
Yeah, I used to live in ATL and we all know who he was! Baker Mayfield is also going to quit football and go into video gaming, I can't see that happening in the NFL, I think he wants to go into something else. He could go into football but video gaming.
I thought about quitting the sport to video game myself, but I would have never thought about quit the sport for a video game.  I would not have been able to beat anyone at Halo 3 in Halo 2.
I guess there is no rule against women playing in the NFL. I guess that means fewer injuries and less rule against them!
I didn't either, but my girlfriend has been a fan since she was a kid when they played. Are you a fan of the Saints?
I like drew brees but he played in the 11 minutes of gameplay. There is a lot of standing around when they played.
That seems like a waste of money.  I heard the cheerleaders for the saints have to leave after every game LOL I think that's kind of sexist, like how can they leave before the players?  That seems kind of racist to me.
That is not fair. Did you know they are putting in shoulder pads that will track the cheerleaders with chips? I wonder if they can track the Cheerleaders with Chip's in the shoulder pads?
I bet they have. I wonder if they are also made by engineers who make more money than players in their lifetime? They make more than engineers whoMake more money in their life, I bet.
Wow, you'd think that an engineer would be more likely to do that. I wonder how soldiers in WW2 were able to make a radio out of razor blades and pencils.
LOL, I can't see how they made radio to work.  That is pure science!
I guess if you tuned into Jupiter you would end up cutting out a lot of station since they have a lot to do.
I heard AM radios can pick up radio waves. That's spooky, isn't it?
I wonder if that was made for SIFI. I wonder if they play Canadian music? Canadian laws make their stations play 40% Canadian music. I'm not sure what playable music they have.
I think they do. I think Bieber has more Canada music than the US music lol. Well it was good chatting with you! I have to get going!
I agree, and I think it would be great if there is a website with classic radio dramas that you can listen to.
Bye! :) :)  You too!
Hi, do you like football?
Hello, I do, how about you?
Yeah, it's a popular sport. I recently found out that the NFL uses tracking chips.
I did not know that. I wonder how they track players and the footballs?
Yeah pretty smart. It tracks speed, location, rotation, rotation...all those stats and more
I wonder what they do with all that data?
I have no clue, but I guess they want to see who can throw it a little faster, or even faster?
I hope they are looking at reducing injuries leading to early retirement, too.
Yeah that would be a good idea, football players do encounter a lot of injuries, I think.
Yes and the average lifetime earnings are much lower, for that reason, and yet an engineer is paid higher than players, and an engineer has an average lifetime incomes of $60,000,000.
Yeah thats crazy!  In the 1960's top bowlers earned more than football players lol
Man times sure have changed!
I dont know if we even leave our homes to rent movies anymore.  It is just too convenient.  We dont have to leave our Homes to rent Movies anymore.
Yes, it is, and that was only in 2007 when netflix started streaming.
I used to use it before they started,  but that was awhile ago.  They still mailed out DVDs lol
Back to football, I'm surprised that the average game only has 11 minutes of real play.
Yeah thats interesting,  and it takes 2+ hours for those 11 minutes lol fun to watch though
Personally sometimes enjoy watching it live, but I also like watching those edited shorts of games on TV.
Did you hear about why New Orleans cheerleaders cant eat in the same restaurants as the players? I wonder why?  I wonder if it is so the cheerleaders can't hear the same as the player.
What a dated and stupid rule, they have to leave if they do not like it, why can't they just leave?
Yeah, I mean that seems really rude. Well it was great talking to you, have a good one.
Hello there, how are you today?
I'm good, how are you?
I am, I am a fan of football as well.
I love football.  I like Sirius radio.  Do you?
No, not anymore, I used to have one, I still use it quite a bit.
Not anymore, but I've followed it for years.  Did you know the NFL has no written rule about women?  They have been in the nfl for a while but have no written Rule about women
Nice! I would like to see a girl tryout. There was a woman quarterback once in a girl's tryout once.
That hasnt happened yet.
I also can't believe there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay, that's so little!
Wow thats amazing, I wonder how many games they have in houres, and how many are in the same houresy.
Yes I guess it worth it though haha. I wonder how long they can keep up with all that technology. Do you like the NFL?
They have tracking chips in their helmets and shoulder pads thats wild!
Yes they track the velocity, speed, speed of the ball, location of the data, and other data like that.
I am sure they record every play made on the field, it is amazing how much they can do now, and it's not like they used to record every game.
Who is your favorite quarterback? Baker Mayfield almost chose not to pursue the football route and became a quarterback instead.
I like single quarterbacks. I couldnt name a particular team I want to play for right now, but I could think of a few.  You?
Cleveland Browns, he's terrible though and he's a proffesional gamer instead haha.
lol,  I think its cool the huddle was invented by a deaf player,  that way if you are on the other team you dont have to say anything to the other player lol
Yea that is awesome, Paul Hubbard is a hall of famer, what a man he was, and how awesome of a hallOf Famer he was.
It was good talking to you!
Thanks. Have a great night!
Hi, do you watch the NFL?
I do! Did you know women can play?
Yes there is no rule that says they can't if they qualify
Yes. Did you know there is only 11 minutes of game play in a game?
That is crazy! I would like the game to end right now, that seems like forever!
Yeah, but engineers make more money than NFL players over a lifetime.  Engineers make more than NFL Players.
I guess they have longer careers and thus need to be better at it
Yeah that is a good point, it makes so much sense.
Did you hear about the rule for the new orleans cheerleaders?
I did! They can't eat in the same restaurant as the players.
Yes and worst of all that rule is that they have to leave mid meal if something happens to them
It is sexist, isn't it?
I agree. Did you know that players get their chips from the chips in the players?
They sure are, tracking velocity and speed and that stuff
Yes and they use the data to make the game safer and also use the DATA to make The game safer
I hope so!  Do you like rap music?
I do. I like some stuff, I like Tupac and Eminem the best. Do you?
Did you know that Tupac's music is in the library of congress for cultural significance?
Did you know Eminem wanted to become a comic book artist?
Yes he liked Spiderman and other superheroes
Yeah. Do you like music?
I guess the NFL protests are going to be a source of contention this new season. We hear a lot about this this year and next, I guess the nfl protests are about to get really serious
I think I remember hearing a few last season when they start to come out, but I don't remember watching much this season. I don's seems like I've seen many teams or players (including my fantasy players) stand or sit or sit and kneel, but no one has done anything to protest. I think Kenny should have done something to Kenny.
It's sad to see that players and the dissenters seem to completely misunderstand what the actions of the players are about and that they completely misunderstand that it is a peaceful attempt to bring injustice to light and not a false call for patriotic awareness.  It's a peaceful Attempt to bringjustice to light but the players seem to see it as a falseCall for patrioticawareness.
The true purpose of the protest is lost.  The concept of bail set pre-trial for a protest is loss.
It covers many areas, like overreach by law enforcement, the in-proportional handling of blacks by the courts, and the overreach of the law in its view of black people.  I can fully understand their frustrations and I understand that it is a product of their frustration and I fully support them in their view.
I hope that there is a clear resolution to this complex matter, with a specific policy change sought.  It is too complex.
I suppose there is a need for a complete reassessment of the criminal justice system. I suppose the situation can be solved but it requires more efforts from the fans, fans of the music and the criminal system. The fans are acting in concert with the rap music and it requires a complete re-evaluation of the system.
I don't expect any resolution anytime in the future. The specific goal seems too nebulous and abstract, and it's too neblish to expect any resolved anytime soon. I feel like a standing still at the last minute trying to move a whole football game toward a specific goal, and then standing still again at the very last minute to try and move it further. I am outnumbered as well, I feel you.
The problem is exasperated along racial divides.  Minorities are apt to react with distrust and will react with suspicion if they're not understood when the anthem is played before a sporting event.  The message is apt.  I thought the anthem was played before every sporting event, not just during one.  But boy was I wrong, it sent the wrong message.
The NFL has even proposed solutions.  They took nonbinding vows and waived fines to let them sing the national anthem.  During the last presidential debates, some of the candidates would sing the National Anthem, some nonbinding, some with proposed solutions, some messy.  I think we are getting to a point where that is not going to happen.
I think the NFL lacks approriate leadership in that area. Taking office is a pledge of alliegence and the pledge is taken before taking office. I agree with the protests but it seems like the NFL doesn't have a firm stand on what it means or that the NFL wants to do.
I disagree that the anthem and the pledge are important. I think that the way that people build our cultural identity and unity are important too. The national identity of the US is one of diversity so the source of unity is the national anthem and it helps people build that.
Yes, I think they are important and should always be important.  We should not be forced to be mindless followers of what we preach, reciting a script of words without the realization of individual rights, or the realization that we are all a country in our own way.  National identity is the realization  of individual freedoms and right to rights.  I think it is important for everyone to have a say in the country they live in, but it is also important to have someone who subscribes to the beliefs of our country and not just be mindless listeners who are forced to obey like mindless followers.
I don't either. Ideally, the script should reflect the values that we hold in common. I am curious to know if the lyrics of some songs have inappropriate or inappropriate lyrics, words or phrases (for example, offense) or if they are just words or words that we relate to. It is curious that there are law enforcement disparities, protests, bail and other issues that we all hold incommon, but the script seems to not reflect the issues.
I think it's a statement of our constitution that all men are created equal, but I also think that the poor or disadvantaged are purposely overlooked or are minorites, and that all minorites like the poor and the disadvantaged are intentionally shoved down our throats at all times. I don't think the government or the Constitution is the right way to do it, but the government is the government, and the Constitution says all men should be created equal.
Agreed. I think it is good to emphasize and adhere to things like the pledge.  I think the pledge, the Anthem, the free speech, and the reason of this land are all things to emphasize.  Liberty and Justice for all.
Those words are believed to have power but are not adhered to a huge amount of the time, including in the super bowl.  I digressed a little on the football subject but do you have a favorite football subject?
I agree with you!  I enjoyed it when Brady beat the Falcons.  I think in retrospect it was educational and effective.  But, I am not sure I would've enjoyed it back when Brady was still free of the weight of the land when he was a non-sequential party.  Hahaha, I know we have been talking about subjects.  It is like a free for all when talking about a subject.  We have been having a lot of fun talking to you about this non- Sequential Party.  You agree with me.
I agree, I hate the Pats and the Saints, this year I'm hoping for the Saints because I'm not going to have all the drama and accusations, but I don't hate the Patriots, I just don't like all the Drama.
I love QBs but I hate them too. I used to love QB's like the Falcons but now I just love Drew Brees. I thought the Pats and sad about the QB I like, Matt Ryan, hate them. I guess I'm just not that into Brady and his Pats, I love Matt Ryan. He's really impressive though. I love the Pats too and thought they were impressive.
My fav is Russel Wilson.  I find I can spar with him verbally with him about anything and he is able to find the way to live up to my state.  kudos to him for his intelligence and insight.  Anyway, I've enjoyed chatting!  It's been a pleasure!  I'm going to go spar with my friend now, since we live in the same state!  Great chatting with you!  Thanks for the intelligence and advice!  Kudos to you and it was a great pleasure!
Likewise, I have enjoyed it as well!  I think I am going to go watch some bowling to calm down.
Haha me too, I have to go walk now, I'll look into it.
Me too.  Seems like a good deal to me.
Huh. Interesting, what are your thoughts on this?
Women would in fact be allowed in the NFL. The NFL has no written rule against female players and women would in in fact, if they met the league's eligibility requirements, be allowed.
Did not know that, I did know that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
That is weird considering the game is on for 3 hours.
Yes.  The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime of an NFL player and an average MLB player.  But the average life earnings of a engineer is actually lower than the life earnings for an average NFL player.
Yeah that is surprising. Did you know that New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an NFL player comes in after, the cheerleaders is required to leave.  I wonder if the cheerleader are required to left if an NFL team comes in and the cheerleading team comes into the restaurant and the Saints cheerleader has been there?
That seems kinda sexist... Did you know the NFL uses tracking chips embedded in the shoulder pads of players to record the move and move speed and velocity, rotation, velocity, velocity and rotation of the ball on the field, and to track players location on the ball.  The chips are then located in the nfl field.
Interesting. Eminem's true dream as a rapper was to become a comic book rapper.
Haha, I would have liked to see someone who exudes comedy like eminem.
In 2001, a Michigan judge delivered her ruling in the form of a rap when trying a suit filed against rapper Eminem.
Did you know Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle, it's called a "compliment battle", do you know what it is?
That makes sense. Koreans have their rules with music. You can't sing anything negative in it. I wonder how they do that. It's been awhile since I've seen a country lol. I know there are certain songs that are negative but I don't know if that's what they mean.
That is very strange. The university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink
Yeah, I wonder why. Is it some kind of strategy?
I saw that the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0.
That is a huge score! Former partiots rb Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his NFL career and has never once fumbled in his nfl career.
ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line in American football games.  ESPN won an Emmy for the superimposing line!
That's good!  I wonder why they came up with that?
In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars!
That seems unfair to football players lol.
Nice speaking to you!  It was nice speaking with you!
Hello, do you follow football?
I do not but I am familiar with the big stories.  How about you?
I know the basics and some fun trivia, but not much more.
My son kind of knows. He doesn't live with me.  I know that Alex Smith, the quarterback of the Redskins, used to live with us, but I don't know much about him.  He's a quarterback.
Yes he is.  After he took so many AP classes in high school he entered college as a junior and got his masters before he started working on his PhD.  He started working right after high school.
That is impressive, he transcends that stereotype that gives the impression of sports players as jocks.
He was actually drafted as the number one pick, not a number one overall.
Do you like football games? I have been to a few football games in my life at Indiana University, but not this one.
I have been to some pro games, but not Florida State, where there is only 11 minutes of live action in one of the games.
I know right, only 11 minutes of play, but that puts you out of time to sit in front of the tv for 3 hours, that's not much time to sitting in front if you think about it
I know, I dont get it, its hard to find time for that on a weekly basis, I know people who do, but not every day, I think it is hard to finding time for it.
I guess some people listen to games on the radio, but it is difficult to get into how the works of the radio.  I don't.  Do you know how many people listen?
Ive seen it,  when youve seen the players on the team you can see them.  Ive seen that before.  It must be harder when it is traveling,  the other team has to do more traveling than the players do.
My favorite NFL team is the Browns. I kind of follow them when I lived in the US. I'm in Northern Ohio so they are a difficult team to support since I'm from there. Do you have a favorite NFL Team to support?
Living in Florida, the Dolphins are hard to root for, but I feel proud of the 49ers.  They're the only one I can feel proud about, though.
It could be worse. I read about the team that lost 220-0.  That was hard to watch and at the end I was like what's the worse that could be.  I think I would have been hard to watching the other team that losses.
It would be hard, I think the tech was really trying to dominate that game.
I hear one team paints the opponents locker room pink and has a plaque in the locker room to commemorate it.  How childish and I think childish.  I wonder why.  Did you hear one Team paints the others locker room blue?
That's the kind of toxic behavior that makes simple things like colors bad.
It's funny that in the sixties, pro bowlers made twice as much as pro players, and footballers back then were huge. I wonder how much money these pro players made?
It is wild to think how much their pay was back then!
I wonder that too.  I wonder what they get for doing that?
Yeah, I don't think it was very well imO so that's why I don's what I know today.
It was nice chatting with you. Have a good evening!
Hello, lets talk about football. Did you know that the University of Iowa painted pink in the locker room for the University?
That's so weird. How does that happen? I wonder why?
I don't, I don't know, I think it's just so the visiting teams can't play in the locker room after the game.  I don's mind if they just have to play in their locker room.
I think it makes perfect sense, that would be one way to throw the visiting team off, but I think that's just for the game, what do you think?
I wonder why they did that back in the 60s?  I also wonder why football stars used to make less money then bowlers.  They used to made more and football stars make less now.
Wow, bowlers? I bet that is not the case these days. Football players make so much more now!
Yes it does. The creation of the yellow first down line won ESPN and Emmy's.
Nice, well deserved because people know now it is a guessing game, it's not an actual first down, the Emmy was more deserved because it is actually a first down. It's nice to have an actual line instead of a guessingGame.
Georgia Tech hold the record for highest scoring game ever with a score of 222 to 0. They won, but I'm not sure who won.
Wow, that is really bad, that's really badly, I wonder if anyone has ever beat them.
I believe it was Cumberland who ended the game with a score of 222 to 0.
I guess Cumberland just made an appearance on the field on their day, that was too bad
Talk about radio storms, they can be heard on AM radio.  There are radio storms so strong on Jupiter that they can can be overheard on AM radios.
Interesting.  Radio systems use an antenna to convert electric currents into radio waves and then use that waves to be used to transmit to other radio systems.
I did not know that, I wonder if I could listen to some classic radio dramas, there is a website dedicated to that, there are so many classic radio Dramas
I did not know that, do you happen to know what this website is?
I do not, what is it?  Did you know that back in WW2 soldiers made radios using only razor blades and a pencil as the back?
Wow, I guess they were very creative in making radios to communicate.
In Canada, radios must play at least 40% canadian music, it's a law!
A radio receiver receives its input from a radio antenna, converts it into a form which is usable by the consumer.  It converts it to a form usable by a radio.
Interesting!  I did not know that.  I also did not that there is a weekly radio broadcast in Finland that is conducted in all classical Latin and is done in Latin.  That's interesting!  Well it was nice talking with you today!
Hello there, how are you tonight? Are you interested in football?
Hey there! I am not into football, I think it's worse than a locker room that is painted pink, I don't know if I would make you play in one that's painted pink.
Grrr, that would make me angry and play harder to show how much I didn't work for the team. It would make the other team play harder too. I would be a pacifist and not play at all. It might do the trick, but it would make us all pacifist. Grrr.
Haha ya you could always do bowling like the University of Iowa does and use the opposing team lol, they do bowling for the opposing side
I wonder if it worked?  I know some teams have actually adopted that as their tactic because it has worked for some teams.  I don't think bowling is really my thing though, I haven't gone recently.  Do you like bowling?
Yeah, I like bowling myself.  It's crazy that bowlers in the 60's made twice as much as top football stars.  Times have changed.
Yes.  I am not surprised.  The bowlers were part of an established sport.  Pro football was not a pay off, but the college game was loved.  And bowlers could pay.  But the college games didn't pay that much, and the bowlers weren't the best.
Yep I agree, I heard that the highest scoring football game was the 1916 game between Georgia Tech and Cumberland, that was the highest scored football game ever!  I wonder how that game was?
That is a ridiculous blowout! They must be very powerful and the game was probably on their schedule.
Yep I agree. What a mismatch. Do you watch football on the television much? I guess ESPN created the yellow line that shows the first down line for television, I guess espn created the line that Shows first down
I guess nobody figured that one out! The yellow line seems so obvious, but it was superimposed on the field to make the game more interesting. Lots of graphics are superimposed over the field and on the ball, but not a yellow line. I guess they had to use lots of graphics on theField to make a game more Interesting.
Yep I agree with you. That seems really obvious but it is crazy that it hasn't won an Emmy yet. I wonder why that is? Why hasn't someone won an emmy for that lol.
I wonder who Iowa will win for that award for the pink line on the field for the first down award.
Haha that is impressive. What are your thoughts about the Patriots? Do you play anymore? I think the Patriots have never fumbled the ball and that is very impressive.
That is incredible, that is a feat, must be some kind of bonus or some special technique or something, I hope it is a guy that is still doing it, that has to be incredible, must have some kindOf bonus for that,
That is incredible! Do you listen to the radio much, or do you listen the TV or listen to youtube more?
I listen sometimes, I used to listen to it as a kid, now I mostly listen to YouTube. I hear it on my commute sometimes. The radio is good, especially the classics, I still like to hear some of the classics on the radio.
I never listened to it in the car but now I listen to it all the time in the radio in my car.  Apparently you can pick up the radio from Jupiter and you can hear it on AM radio!
I've never tried that but I do know a lot of things about the storms on Jupiter.  For instance, I know that the AM radio has some broadcasts in Latin because the news broadcasts in latin because of the radio.
haha that's what I was thinking too!  I'm trying to think of a few good Canadian artists off the top of my head, no matter what it's of Canadian origin.  I think 40% of all Canadian radio in Canada has to be of Canadian Origin, so there have to be some good Canadians out there, right?  I can think of some good Canadian Artists, off the head of my mind no matter where I am haha
Bieber, April Wine, Rush, April, April wine, Bryan Adams, Neil Young, Rush.  Those are some of the popular ones.  Not sure about the others.
Haha, I'm going to give you Rush. I'd rather listen to a classic radio drama for free. There is a website where you can listen to  a bunch of them for free!
Are you a football fan?  Did you know that the visitors locker room is pink at the university of Iowa?
I am, I love pro ball but I am more interested in college.  I do not like the emotional from players and they get so emotional from the other team.
Did you know that in the 1960's top bowlers earned twice as much as top football stars?
Football was very popular in the beginning of the 1930s and was still popular in 1960s. At the beginning there were different leagues but it consolidated at the US level in the 60s. It has remained at that level ever since.
Cool.  Did you know that the highest scoring game ever was when georgia tech beat cumberland 222 to 0.  That was in 1916.
I saw that, I think they were the defensive coordinator back then.  Do you have a favorite team?
The Carolina Panthers. Oh man, I do! I can't believe Tom Brady was a backup quarterback and did not start in 2007. The team was having a historically bad season and the backup quarterback didn't even notice. The coach was a new coach. The QB, Tom Brady, didn't start.
I'm not a fan of any of the teams. I was an avid Raiders fan for many years, but moved to DC and now root for the Seahawks since they have been doing well since I moved there. Do you like any other teams?
Seattle are cool. I'm in the same state. I was a Russell Wilson fan for a few years. I think Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL. I wonder if there is a left handed Quarterback.
That's a good one.  I think it was Kenny Stabler.  That was not long ago, so maybe a leftie would not be such a hinderance.  A left-handed QB might be an asset, not a hinderant.
I remember that.  Another cool fact is the circular huddle that we still use today was actually started by a deaf quarterback.  Paul D. Hubbard was a QB and he started the huddling up to use hand signals to the defense so the defense could not see the hand signals.  I wonder if that was the same quarterback who used the circularhuddle that is used today?
I heard about that, very smart. I also heard that the QB Alex Smith was always the one that handled the snaps, never touched the center and he was always great when he did it. He was so smart.
He took so many AP tests in high school to enter college as a junior that he was able to take the AP tests when he was in highschool.
He was an amazing man.  He was raised in Fairbanks, Alaska and had to play in the snow in high school.  In mid-December, when it's a short season, they totally disappear.  They don't play in it in the mid-February.
I played basketball.  Back to Alex Smith, he got his master's degree and then began working on his master degree before he was the first overall pick in the nfl draft.
Education is a sure thing. I hope he finishes it. It will pay off.
Very true.  Baker Mayfield, the quarterback at the University of Oklahoma, once considered quitting football to become a full-time competitive gamer.  I wonder why he did that?
One of my sons wanted to be a game coder, not a specialist, but ended up becoming a super bowl LIke him.  He was a first round pick and has been a gamecoder, too.
I have not, but I played games on the University of Oklahoma's "Halo 3".  There's a guy there who claims he can beat anyone at the University and he played against the University Of Oklahoma.  He also claims to be the best at Halo 3.
I think the game requires quick reflexes I lost all the time. I am alright in strategy games, but that's about it. The game requiresquick reflexes.
Well, thanks for the chat.
Good morning!  Are you planning to watch the NFL playoffs today?
I'm a huge Eagles fan, I can't get behind the birds, but I'll try, how about you?
Go Eagles!  Do you like Wentz or Foles as your quarterback for the Eagles?
I like Wentz but Foles seems to have some magic to him.
The officials aren't protecting QBs like Foles either, roughing the passer calls are so awful. I don't like the way players play today.
I agree.  Do you know who Clay Matthews is?
Good point and Redskins QB Josh Norman has been outspoken about the issue.
Josh Norman is disliked by some where I live.  It is a common opinion that he does not play well and doesn't want to play.  That is the talk here in DC but I can't believe that Josh Norman is dislike.
lol, I am biased but i do support the both redskins and eagles, but im biased.
I support the Eagles because they are my local team and I see them daily,  I also like the Redskins because we have a ton going on there.  I kind of like the circus lol,  but I support the Redskins as well because they have the best local team.
I bet it is, especially in Nebraska where college football is king! I was thinking about Iowa where visiting locker room rooms are painted pink.
lol, I heard about that!  Do you follow an NFL team?
I do like most of the teams, it's a good game. I don't root for any one of the coaches, but I root for the teams.
I listen to alot of radio. How do you listen?
I do listen to the radio.  I do not listen to much talk radio though.  In Canada they actually require almost half of the music in the radio be Canadian.  No choice I guess.  That would require almostHalf of the talk radio be canadian.
I read that.  That is kind of interesting.
I am interested in the innovation like World War II soldiers who were able to construct a working radio using a pencil and switchblade.
I have seen that. I was really shocked when i read that! I think I was shocked when I first read it, that is amazing.
I guess I find everything about sound fascinating. I figure that all waves can be converted into sound and we can figure out how to use it.
I have no idea moments like that are so crazy to me.
Have a great day and good luck to the Eagles!
Do you watch football?  I do.
I love to watch football, do you ?
Yeah, I like it a lot. Did you know the University of Iowa locker room is pink?
I think that's pretty intersting.  I wonder how that works if the opposing team can actually see it or if it only has an effect on them.
I'm sure it does not bother them but it is definitely an impetus to beat the other team bad.
I agree.  Did you know Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL and the only one left handed?
I am unsure who is the only one, but I think he is one of the only ones.
I'm not sure. Superbowl winning QB Brad Johnson is the only QB in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass to himself.
That occurred in the year 2007? I wonder what year that was.
I don't know, but I do know that Doug Williams and Russell Wilson are the only african-american QB that have won the superbowl.
I do remember Doug Williams! I think that the greatest Superbowl was the 42-10 crushing defeat against the Broncos in the '84, which I think is also known as the greatest superbowl ever.
I remember that too, huge defeat.
Yes, the game was down by 20 touchdowns by the 4th quarter.
Russell Wilson is still under a major league baseball contract
Interesting. Good for him, but I am not familiar with him.
He is good, he is really good. Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team.
I heard that.  I wonder what the release was for?
I have not heard of it, but I do know that the highest paid of the five service branches is the department of defense employees and they are football coaches for three of the four service branches.
I think it is Army, Navy, Airforce, and the Marines.
Yep, that is it. It's pretty amazing he makes so much money, more than government employees, it's pretty remarkable.
That's a pretty interesting fact. Nice chatting with you.
Are you a fan of sports?
I am a big football fan.  How about you?
I do too, my favorite team at all times is the NY times.  Who is your favorite team?
I like watching the New Buffalo Bills, but I don't really have a favorite team, what about you?
Did you get a chance to watch the superbowl this year?
I didn't. But I know the Patriots did a good job doing well. It's been so long since I've seen them. I do like Tom Brady though. He's done a good jobs for so long. I like him going back to his days at Junipero Serra High School.
Tom Brady is undeniable one of the greatest quart-backs the league has had in recent times, and I think that the game has been more exciting, and Tom Brady is one of his greatest quart -backs the League has had, the game is much more exciting now
Yeah, pretty boring.  Atleast it wasn't Cumberland against Georgia Tech.  Georgia tech was a complete blow out and won 222-0.
I can't imagine watching that. I would have left after I hit 70-0 and been there for an hour or more to get my car started lol. I couldn't stand to be around when they hit 100 and still had 5 left, imagine watching it at that!
Yeah that is alot of scoring in one game, it is alot. I bet the quarterback did alot of work in that game too.
I know right!  How can a player on a team be quarterback and not know the play?  How does he/she get the ball and play?
I'm sure.  Did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback?
I wonder how that technique is used in modern times, I know a deaf quartback changed history and I wonder how a deaf Quartback changed History in a different way
Yeah, he was a smart quarterback.  Alex Smith was a really smart quarterback too.  He took so many ap test in high school, he entered college as a junior and was the only one to do so.
I knew he had a strong mind, he is good at making plays and is also good at make plays with a strong think.
He was a good quarterback! he had a strong mind and a strong arm and a good strong mind.
I think so.  I would like to see a mind like John Madden or an arm like Peyton Manning.
I heard that Baker Mayfield almost quit football to pursue full-time competitive game.
That goes to show you that he is multi talented, not only awesome at gaming but also multi talented.
He could, he did claim he cold beat the QB from U of Oklahoma at Halo 3 and they claim heCold beat him
I was a huge fan of the Halo games, I liked Call of Duty the most. Xbox was really popular then.
I did not like that either!  I wish I had the original Halo edition Xbox, though.
I used to love playing only shotguns and swords!  Halo changed eveything for me!  Have an awesome day my friend, have an awesome Day!
Hi, are you a fan of football?
Hi, I do not follow football.  How about you?
I know a little bit, I'm impressed with the QBs. I think he's a good quarterback.
The QB is the toughest position to get through. They play under the most physical punishment. They touches the ball in almost every play.
I'm pretty sure he is the leader of the offensive team, he is pretty much the whole offensive team.
I guess the coach has to choose his / her players carefully, they have to want a player that understands what he or she is trying to achieve and how to achieve it. What is your favorite QB?
Well Tom Brady is probably my favorite because he is supposedly pretty good, but I like any QB.  Do you have a favorite?
He's good, but I like QBs who can win and I like the underdog. I like to root for the underdog, and he's one of those QBs.
Yeah, he has had his fair share of Super Bowls, but he doesn't plan his Februarys right.
Yeah I dont plan a vacation in February, i just listen to the radio.  Yeah they are going to defend that crown in LA so he might have to defend it, I dont plans to plan a vacations in February either.
I do.  I listen to NPR sometimes.  Did you know that soldiers figured out how to make "foxhole radios" to work back in WW2?  Back then they used to be just foxhole radios.
lol  I wonder who taught them how to do that?  I like to listen to it sometimes.  Do you know Latin?  Did you know that there is a whole news in latin?
I think it was a razorblade and a pencil, or a razor and a razor blade and a pen.
Amazing.  I guess they didn't need instructions or listen to any instructions or listening to the enemy.  They just listened to storms on Jupiter.
I'm listening to a canadian artist right now, and the probability of it being a canada/canada artist is actually pretty high.
Yeah,  and if they were stuck listening to Rush,  they would be stuck listening.  LOL  I think it helped them out with radio dramas though,  maybe they helped them with that.
I prefer to listen to sports trivia.  Did you know that a patriots running back never fumbled the ball in his entire career?!  I wonder how that is possible?
That is amazing!  I wonder if he gets a bonus for that.  That is quite the feat.
Yes, I wonder that as well.  I think I will wrap up this chat about football by asking if it was possible to chat about the huddle on the radio, Paul Hubbard, and the radio huddle.  Thanks for the time of your conversation.
Paul Hubbard was an innovator, an innovATOR, and a legend. Great chat, thanks.
Thanks! Ciao!  Ciao.
Hi!  do you like football?
I don't care for it. I worked security in New Orleans for the Superbowl and the first one I was there I worked Security.
Nice.  Do you ever get pics or autographs?
No, I did not.  Pretty interesting that bowlers once made more money than footballers.
I did not know that.  This years season is wrapping up and the days are long, the playoffs start soon and the playoffs are in a few years, this years season has already been going for a while.
Yep, I wonder if a competitive gamer like Baker Mayfield thought he could play Halo 3 and play halo 3.
Did he beat everyone he met in college when he was in college? He beat them in the tourney a couple years back.
That is cool, did you play Halo 3? I like that game, do you play halo 3?
I play Call of Duty now hoping that Baker will jump online someday and we can beat all of them lol!
I've never played it, lol. I'll have to look it up.
Did you see Alex Smith break his leg in the game a few weeks ago?  He was in that game a little while ago.
Ouch!  I guess it wasn't smart for him not to be safe.
Maybe. Maybe he should have known to fall back on his play. He could have gotten out of it!
Yes, that would be a long career.  I mean what is a sport not designed for.
I wonder if it would have sped up the game if the huddle, the huddled, was still around?
I hear you on the huddle.  I use it all the time, but I don't know if I like it.
I like it too.  It was started by a deaf QB who was needed.
True, but it's still a part of how players communicate with each other.  If the players communicate by using hand signals, then it's possible that someone deaf like Hubbard could see.
I think Brady has left us for a while, he no longer is.
I think he has some time left. I hope he has more time left!
Merry xmas!  Thanks!
Hey there! How are you?
Hello, I am well thank you, do you enjoy any hobbies?
Yeah I do, I'm a big football fan. I went to a Chiefs game with my boyfriend once and it was pretty interesting. I'm not crafty like he is, but I like that.
I have a passing knowledge of football and watch it occasionally.
Do you know the teams?
The new england patriots, the lannisters of football
LOL yeah they are.  I like Tom Brady as a quarterback.  He is one hell of a quarterback!
He is. Green Ellis has never fumbled once in his entire career!  Talk about dependable!
Yes, I wonder if he can still play.
The New England Patriots.  I think he is a QB there.
Cool! Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL? There is only one left handed Quarterback in the nfl
That is amazing!  Being left handed is more cons than pros unlike other sports because a quarterback can have more cons as a left handed QB, there are more cons to being left handed in the pros unlike in other sports.
Yeah, and they call the plays with the huddles.
I know, they are overseen by the QB who can't even see in huddles and have to be started due to the signs they have to say. There was once a deaf quarterback who was able to get started after being started due by the deaf quarterback in the huddling
That is interesting. I think it's also interesting the university of Iowa's locker room for the visiting team is painted pink.
I wonder if that is to mentally perturb the opposing team or to balance out the balance?
I think that is the one, it's really funny.
In any case, if I stood up for what I wanted to do I would have done it, I'm sure of it!
Yep football history has a lot of interesting facts like ESPN won an emmy for the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line in American football games
I understand that.  The gameplay is so much better than digesting the first dozen or so minutes of gameplay but the action is helpful to see and understand.  An average NFL game is only 11 minutes in duration, so the action of an average NFLgame is probably a dozen or two minutes.
Yeah, I know.  I think it's embarrassing the score of the highest score in a game was actually the super bowl, Georgia vs. Georgia.  Tech defeated Cumberland 222-0.  How embarrassing.  That's a low.
That was a bit disappointing, I wonder if it was the initial ceremony that was a little bit disappointing. In any case, thanks for chatting!
Do you like football?  I do!
Not really but I like the fight song, Snoop Dogg once wrote a fight song for his son's high school team
That is pretty cool.  Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
Wow, is that supposed to have an effect on the opposing team?  I wonder if it is supposed to?
Good point. Did you know ESPN once won an Emmy?
Hmm I do not know, how do you qualify for those awards?
Yeah, and they also have a superimposed yellow for the superimposed Yellow
In any case, i was happy that they did that, it made the game much easier to watch at home.
That's true. Bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s, and even bowlers in the 50s.
Wow interesting.  NBA coaches are the highest paid though, only after military and the highest pay for the NBA coaches.
I am not surprised by that at all. Do you know who Benajrvus Green-Ellis is?
I hear he has a huge stadium in Texas.
I did not. How big is it?  I do know that Benjarvus has never fumbled the ball, he is the only NFL player to never do so.
Wow, that is impressive. Do you listen to the radio? I listen to it on the radio.
Yes I do. You can catch Jupiter's storms on am radio
Wow cool. One of the most popular radio acts in the 1930s was a ventriloquist.
Hmm interesting. Have you heard of foxhole radio?
I have not heard of them.  But I have heard of a radio station that turns solar energy into sounds.  I wonder if that is the same station that turned solar energy from a sun into sounds?
Wow cool, I didn't know that. Have you ever listened to Canadian radios?
I haven't, I'm not sure I've ever, but it's time I guess. Back to football, Kellan Moore is the only QB in the NFL who has ever done it half handed!
I did not know that, wow, do you think he gets any advantages or anything?
Hey there, do you watch football?
I do enjoy watching football both in collegiate and professional!
Yes, I do too.  The highest score ever in football was 222-0.  That happened in 1916.
That is insane! Good for the team. They make a lot more than I do. They could have gone on strike for better pay or something, but they didn't.
Georgia tech defeated Cumberland in 1916
Brad Johnson is my favorite quarterback! He's the only quarterback in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass to himself!
That's awesome! So true! I guess quaterback is the position that many people don't think about since it's the person under the center of the position.
Yeah.  All your attention is focused on you.  Have you ever been to a live football game?
No, I haven't.  I am a student at UT-Austin.  Btw, did you know the University of Iowa's locker room is pink because the visiting football team.  The university's lockerroom is pink.
Wow I did not know that. I have attended a game in my high school stadium that seats 18,000 people and cost $60 million to build, I wonder why they would paint it pink? It's my high SCHOOL Stadium that seats 17,000People.
I'm wondering about it as well. I guess it's sort of influence on minds? I'll have to google it later if I hit that up and see. To change topic, I was reading about this rule that I just read, in Canada, all music music must be Canadian. I wonder why? I guess I'll google it for more info on that rule, but now I'm wondering if it's just a radio rule or if it really has a hit!
Yeah, Canada is on my bucket list, I have been to Banff and I think I'll go again soon.  Yeah, it's not something that you intimidate me and I wonder how many radio stations actually uphold it and how many of those radio stations monitor it.
lol I honestly listen radio in my car and I am not sure.  Maybe a special government agency?  lol
Yeah, I used to listen to the radio all the time I exposed myself to it.  There is a radio station that translates solar activity into sound for people to listen for the sun's music.
I was wondering to find this website that has all episodes of classic radio dramas for free. I wonder if it's still around?
I didn't know that.  I'm not sure if they are considered podcasts though or if they're actually radio dramas.
Well, they are theater performance of the radio.  It was popular some dozens years ago but is more popular now, with Youtube, Netflix time, and YouTube being more popular than played in radio. I guess they were popular somezens years ago as well.
I rely on podcasts more. I have long commutes and that radio time is often filled. I had no idea Bing Crosby was so popular in the radio back then. He filled over half of the radio time in 1948. I also had no Idea Bing Crosby had an idea of how to rely on Podcasts.
The radio was popular at that time, soldiers in WWII really appreciated the opportunity to listen radio, they had the opportunity for the first time to listen to the radio, I wonder if the radio was Popular in the US.
Yeah I think they did, it was their only source of entertainment back then, I bet it was. ventriloquists on radios was a popular radio act, they had talent! I bet that is why they became a popular TV act too.
True, it must have been quite a hit! Nice to meet you. Thanks for the chat, have a good day.
Have a good day as well!
Hey how are you, do you watch the NFL? It stands for the National Football League btw.
I follow it pretty closely, how about you?
I used to follow it, but I found it a bit boring so I only watch the Super Bowl, I like the Patriots I'm glad they won I didn't like the other Patriots I glad they winning so I didn's follow it much,
Yeah, I'm a Patriots fan as well, and yeah I think the Superbowl was super boring this year.
I agree. The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of gameplay, most of that is referees and the rest is commercials, so that's why the average NFLgame only has about 11 minutes or so of gameplay
Yeah I wonder that too.  standing around is a big part of it too, yeah
Yep that's true. Do you watch the NFL? Apparently there is no rule against them having female players but there is a rule against it. I wonder if we'll ever see female players
I don't know that I would, but I know people who like female players.
Yeah I think they are too athletic for that, and yeah I don't know. Did you hear about how the New Orleans Saints treat their cheerleaders?
Yeah I have friends who cheered for them a few years back and I think they had a rule about that.  There are a lot of teams that have that rule, the Redskins for example.
Interesting, the Redskins do not have that rule? I wonder what the other teams do, or if cheerleaders have that same rule?
I don't know lol.  They probably got paid well and did a lot of work.  Chris Cooley who was a cheerleader at one time ended up marrying one of them and at the same time ended to be a player.  I wonder if that rule was created to keep them from fraternizing with the player and the cheerleaders?  That would be a big stink if it was created by a player, lol.
lol That's funny!  I guess it's a rule for the opposing team to be able to use the team locker rooms.  Apparently the University of Iowa has a pink locker room for the team, and the opposingteam has a red locker room.  I wonder what they are using?
That was hilarious. I don't know about that. I'm not sure what bothers you about that, guest teams do that sometimes?
LOL.  In terms of it being funny to the other team, I think they should just check their win-loss record before they say anything.  It would make no difference.  Bowlers used to make twice as much as football players back in the 60s, and it made no difference in the terms.
I think back in the day, maybe it was because it was more popular bowling, not sure.
I'm not sure, I know that the Flintstones were super popular, but it shows that you never know where things were back then, you just know. Did you know that ESPN has a superimposed yellow line for first down that won an Emmy? I wonder if that was for the flintstones, or if that is for other things as well?
I think they deserve the Emmy, that is pretty cool, it is pretty neat. I didn't know football players became bowlers, did you know that?
Good question!  I know that in the 60s they were paid more lol,  I wonder how many good football players we lost to bowlers?  I'm sure we had some good football and dogs that could have been paid more LOL
I have never had a dog.  I've heard that dogs and elephants are the only animals that instinctively understand pointing.
Interesting question mark... I agree they are the only ones, but I wonder why they don't include other animals like gorillas or dolphins or anything else, apparently.  Google prefers dogs and elephants to cats lol they put in their code of conduct that they don's to have cats lol
Have you heard about the pictures of Odell Beckham doing cocaine?
I haven't seen those pictures yet, but people seem pretty angry about them. There's a lot of disappointment in general.
I think cris carter was also mad, calling him stupid.
I think that was wrong. He was highly paid and the highest paid receiver in history. He should forego a few years of partying to secure a long term future instead of going wrong.
I agree with Carter.  I think he got kicked out of the league, but his image in sports matters.
I had no idea that Carter would say anything like that.  I think he did allude to that the actions, not his actions.  He might lose that spot and then grow up and lose it all again.  People have to grow up, it's important.
He compared Beckham to Lawrence Taylor, who is a famous player who battled drugs too.
Beckham has a big drug and alcohol problem is weird. He was caught with cocaine in 2001. I feel like he has taken the right path, but being caught with a drug andalcohol problem is a slippery slope.
Absolutely, he is not mature enough to be on and off the field. He is in line to make $32 million in a few years and then he is going to be in line for more in a couple of years when he will be in the games and in line at $32 billion.
He's been in a big boys club of letting good players loose.  I'm glad people are starting to call out the big boys for it.  They cut good players and then they cut good men.
I agree.  Kids need better role models.  The NFL is a professional league that gets huge amounts of viewers and the first game in February gets crazy.  It's the Super Bowl championship and the kids like to see the best in the NFL.
So true!  The NFL is doing a lot to improve it's image on treatment for the players, too.  They have tracking chips in the shoulders and the shoulders of the football that let them track a player's every move.  I think it will help lessen injuries and help the game move into a new era.  The nfl has done a lot of things with tracking chips.
Yes, but there are a lot of injuries because there are only 11 minutes of actual gameplay, so that is not much.
Yes, stemming from earlier versions of the game when the back of the head was more rough like rugby. Now the real protective gear and the head is more real protective.
Absolutely.  I think the career of an engineer is higher than an NFL player for a reason the lifetime earnings of an Engineer is higher.  Their career is a lot longer.
It's funny to think that back then, bowlers were paid better. I can't imagine sitting down and watching bowling. bowling alleys were popular. It was exciting to see how exciting it was.
Yeah, I love bowling. I think the NFL has some female bowlers, too. I didn't know it was allowed for women to play in the NFL until 1993.
I don't think the women will meet that "gold standard" if it doesn't apply to them. New Orleans even makes cheerleaders leave a restaurant if football players come in. Sexism at its finest, but sexism at its best.
No kidding? I wonder if there will ever be a female kicker for one of the teams. New Orleans is so far out there. I wonder why they don't have a female Kicker. I don't think locker rooms are an issue for other teams.
That is true and the world of football is still more of a boys club in my image. I don't think women will be in the future because of the way they are treated in the world, it is a boys' club for the class people and that is not true, women will have to come through for themselves, it will take some time but it is the future!
I wonder if the university of Iowa paints the visiting teams locker room pink?  The University of Iowa paint the visiting Teams locker room Pink.
Hi, do you like reading about pokemon?  I guess there are over 750 episodes of it!  That's about 50 a year for 16 years straight!
Hello there!  I was never a Pokemon fan, but I figure if the show is on, I might have to get my kids.  I have never seen the show.
I'm not a fan, my youngest brother is and he used to love that show, he does Pikachu's voice and the yellow character.  He was the most popular one.  I was reading about televisions and they recently broke mine.  Did you know that Pikachu's name is actually the last name of the youngest brother of the yellow Character and he is actually doing Pikachu's Voice?
Isnt that show Japanese?
Yes, it is called "Days Like These" and I heard that the show was remade verbatim in the UK and called "The 70s Show".  Speaking of foreign TV, did you know that 70s show was remake in the US but got cancelled after only 10 episodes?  I kind of wish it hadn't been cancelled after 10 episodes.
I wonder why verbatim is so stupid?  It looks like a fool to me!
I found out that New York's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. I learned a fun fact about the rotary telephone and found out it was New York area code because it is the fastestnumber to dial!
New Yorkers got lucky!  I didn't know that!  A rotary phone was really slow.  I wonder why?  I've never used a rotary telephone.
I've used a rotary phone a few times, but never a rotar phone. In fact, that makes me feel really good about the fact I never used one! Haha. What makes it so weird and weird is that you can't separate 2 overlapped books that have been overlapped together for fun and apparently it is impossible simply by looking at each other. Wow, that's a good one!
I guess I'll have to try that. I wonder if I could win a drink from a bar bet on that, a rotary phone and a bar, I could use that useless fact as a barbet, and win a beverage!
I have used some sort of a phone like that, but it doesn't sound very reliable. Another fact about phones is that the internet and internet data cables carrying phone and data across oceans are only 2.7 inches in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor. That doesn't seem like it would be very working out. The cables are only about 2. 7 inches in circumference and just sort of lay onthe ocean floor, but still.
That is pretty sturdy!  I wonder what lives on the bottom of the sea, there are tiny creatures on the sea bottom.
I wonder if there is any fact that we know about the iphone, like the fact that it has more computing power than the entire us nuclear ICBM deterrent
I dont.  I have an iPhone.  coincidentally, i dont know what the ICBM deterrent is.
haha I wish I had one, but my iphone is too expensive for my taste and my wallet, it's too expensive to me haha
It is expensive, but it is good to know that the ICBM deterrent has text messaging, so that is good.
Apparently, Unicef will donate a day of clean drinking water to a child in need for every minute you do not use your cell phone. They aim to do it simply by simply saying, "You're gong to help a child, so we'll donate a DAY of clean water for everyminute you don't use your phone".  I don't know how much I'd donate, though, what would I do with that $300?
Raising awareness I guess, but I wonder how they know that is the solution to the problem.  Most people are on their phones, but how much time they spend on theirPhones?  How many people are actually using their phones?  Is there really a need for them?  I wonder if there is a solution?  We need to think about the planet..not just the time they spent on their phone.
Yeah, that's the point. I have my phone turned off at this point, renders it pretty useless, so I don't use it as much. I get sick of the spam calls and all the kids are calling all the time, so it feels good to have my cell phone turned away for a little while.
Yeah,I guess I am too all the time.. all the times. irritating. Anyway, great chat!
Yeah it is great chatting with you as well.
Hi, how are you? Do you like football?
Yes, I like the NFL, I think the games are a way to build rivalries and it helps build rivalities.  How about you?
I completely agree. 16 is a good number of games. It is enough for one NFL team to play 16 games in a season.
I would think 20 games for each of the 32 teams and 16 games for the playoffs. That is how many games are actually played between the teams.
I think it might be a bit different this year though, there are so many injuries and they have very few players left.
Yes it is a rough sport. I wonder how many teams have a team like the Roosters, there are only two teams at this point so they must make sure they have someone in the lineup.
There are only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game.
Yeah,  but with good commentators with good replays to fill the rest,  I prefer watching other things.
Yeah, I think there are other things you can watch on television that are better.
Funny cartoons, especially the Simpsons. Did you know there is only one episode where Bart neither appears, nor is referenced in the episode?
Yeah I think I have seen that episode,  I love the Simpsons.
I never knew. that is boring stuff, I know they remake that 70's show in the UK and it was dreadful, only 10 episodes.
Yeah that is definitely not something I would watch! I like The Office. I wonder if the UK version of the office has the uks sense of humor.
Yes, foreign shows have success.  Pokemon has over 750 episodes in the states.  That's more than Pokemon.
That's a lot of episodes. I'm not a big fan but if I had to find the time I might try it. I liked the Office, but that's a whole lot of episode too.
I'm sure it is an artistic process fueled by inspiration, and they produce without a standardized system.  South Park had over 750 episodes.  I'm sure a lot of them were built car on a built car and not a standardized standardized system, but it is a lot to produce.
I do, they are really funny.  I like that the Simpsons crew sent the South Park crew flowers after the final episode of Family Guy and the Simpsons Crew sent them flowers after their final episode
Yeah, they criticized their humor as totally random but they justified it because they like that kind of humor.  Like the one about manatees.
Have you ever watched Family Guy?  I like that one.  Have you seen Thomas the tank?
I scan the channels from time to time!  Ringo stars in it, I think they hired stars to do the narrate instead of just using Ringo.
Great chatting with you!  Have a great one!
I took for granted that we had wireless phones, but back in the day we didn't even know what wireless was.
lol  Did you know that a rotary phone is actually 10 days older than dirt?  That's just old.  It's like the days older that a phone!
I have, but they were kind of slow to use.  New Yorkers are an efficient area code because they are the most efficient area Code.
Yeah, New Yorkers got lucky. I bet folks in Alaska and Hawaii don't get as slow.
Yeah good guess. An iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent!
I did not know that. I know that the iphone is used for text messaging now.
Did you know Unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you do not use rotary phones?  If you enroll in their program, UniceF will donate  a day's clean water for everyminute you do NOT use rotaries!
I'm not sure how they do that. I figure that if you don't use your phone that the water gets donated. I wonder how many people do that? I know that people can get addicted to their phones. Is there a web site where you can figure that out?
I don't know, but people use a lot of water. It's hard to believe that the cables carrying phone and internet data across oceans are only 2.7 inches in diameter. That's not a lot, especially since the cables are 2.8 inches in circumference!
Theres a problem with that. A bundle of fiberoptic cables? That is a problem. The thread carries a ton of signals and theres no way to fix it.
I wonder if they simply just lay them on the ocean floor or if there is an electrical engineer on duty?
I guess that means there is a lot of life dont you think? we need to send out a probe, i guess we could see if there is any life there, but I think we would need to go there first.
Yeah, that's a good guess, but I plan to try it! Apparently it is impossible to separate two phonebooks that simply have their pages overlapped together. I wonder how they do that.
No, I don't think I would try that.  Phone books are the best things to have around these days.  Do you watch much TV?
I do, I really enjoy it, and you?
I know, that was until color came out a few years ago.
Did you ever watch Thomas the Tank Engine on the television?  They had celebrities narrate that show.
My kids love that show. I wonder who does it now.
There have been many celebrity narrators, George Carlin, Alec Baldwin, George Strait, Ringo Starr, and many more.  I believe there are over 750 episodes of it!
I wish more of them would lend their talents to the show.  I will have to check it out.  Anyway, great chat!  check it Out!
It was great chatting with you as wellI hope you have a great day! I wonder if they remade that 70s show in the UK, it wasn't remade very well
Hello.  Did you know that there is a Unicef site to sign up for a program that donates a day of clean water for every minute you don't use your cell phone?  I'm going to go to the UniceF site to Sign up for that.
Hello, I have heard about it before.  I don't know where I use my cell phone.  Did you know it has more computing power than the US nuclear icbm deterrent and I don's nuclear ICBM deterrent.
I thought that was crazy, too. It's impossible to separate two phonebooks whose pages have overlapped, that's why it is impossible toseparate two phone books
Yeah, and the cables carrying phone and internet data across the oceans floor and across the water lying in the water are all just water lying on the oceans floors.
Are you a simpsons fan?  There is only one episode where Bart isn't present, nor is he even mentioned and he isn't in the episode.  There's only one Episode where Bart is not in or present.
I do watch the Simpsons, but not for a long time.  Strange.  Did you know woman were in the league of the WNBA before the WNba?  I didn't know that a woman could ever be in the leagues.
I'm not sure what sport you are referring to.
I'm referring to women. I saw a line backer tackling a women in the NFL.
I was more concerned about the Saints treatment of the kickers.  I know that some high school teams and some schools have girls as cheerleaders and some high schools have boys as kickers or even cheerleaders.  These are archaic practices.
That's so sexist, and strange that they would do that. I think it's to avoid employee fraternization. Did you know that there's only 11 minutes of live play in a game if a game?
I used to watch a lot of football. Did you know that Alec Baldwin has narrated over 50 episode of Thomas the Train.
I wonder if there are any episodes that Ringo Starr or George Carlin haven't done?
George Carlin was amazing, I saw a few episodes of him, but I didn't think he was that old.
George Carlin was so funny, did you watch that 70s show? I never did, did it was funny?
Yes I did. I am curious to see how the Britian version compares, I wonder if it is on Netflix.
I don't know.  I think that 70s show was canceled, after only 10 episodes.  lol  I can't think of anything else.   lol
I read that the producers of South Park received flowers from the Simpsons crew after they did the Family Guy episode.  I wonder if they got flowers from The Simpsons crew?  The producers of south park received flowers?
Yeah that was very funny and very nice of them, that was nice of both of them. Do you know how many teams the NFL has?
I do not, but ESPN won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow line.
I love that line, especially in the regular weeks.  I think that is when teams have their bye week during the bye week and then the other teams come in.
Interesting. Well thanks for chatting with me, enjoy your day!
You too!  Thanks!
Do you watch the NFL?
Yes I do! Did you know women can play too?
Yes as long as they qualify, there is no rule against it
Yeah.  In an active game there is only 11 minutes of TV during the whole active game
Yes.  Did you know engineers make more money over their lifetime?
Yes and because they have longer careers than the football players do
True. Good point. Did you hear about the rule for New Orleans cheerleaders?
I did not. They can't eat in the same place as the players.
Yes and they have to leave mid meal if they walk in
Yes that is absurd and sexist.
I agree. Do you think they use tracking chips on the players like they do for the tracking chips?
They are collecting stuff like velocity and rotation
Yeah. Do you know much about presidents?
Some stuff. Do you know who the wealthiest 3 are?
Yes that would be Jefferson, Washington and JFK
Yeah. Do you know what the first president of Zimbabwe was called?
Yes he was called President Banana
Yes. Did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house?
Cool. Do you know how the VP used to be elected?
That was the runner up that became the VP. Do you use facebook?
I do. Did you know they turned down being offered Myspace?
Yesh, for $75 million they could have made billions now
The Miami Dolphins are not doing well lately, with many boycotting them due to continued demonstrations against police brutality and social injustice during the national anthem.
I watch a lot of football.
I read somewhere that police unions are urging members in south Florida to boycott.
That sounds dramatic.  I know the police are upset with the players but they are supporting the military, so it sounds like the police want players to go.
It sounds like it.  The NFL and players association has an official policy agreed on.  It's a difficult situation.  I wonder what the official policy is?
I agree.  The Super Bowl is coming up soon and the NFL gets a lot of attention.  Do you know when it is?
Some players take a knee during the preseason opener.  Robert Quinn shook his fist at the law enforcement officers and said he didn't want to be associated with them.  Some people felt it was a slap at the Dolphins.  During the preseason, players, like the Dolphins, took a knee at the NFL preseason opener, and Robert Quinn shake his fist and said that he felt like he was trying to slap the lawbreakers.
I wonder if it was in the NFL game?  There are only 11 minutes of actual playing time in an NFL game.
That is an interesting fact. I know that NFL players make a lot of money but they don't make a whole lot more than NFL or MLB player. On average, NFL players earn less than MLB players and even MLB players don't. If you're working as an engineer though, the payoffs are much greater with lifetime earnings greater than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL or NFL player.
I find that hard to believe.  Do you like the NFL?  Apparently there are no rules against women in the NFL.  I find that very hard to think of!
I guess if one makes it big someday, I guess we'll see. I just hope it's not a lady. It's difficult to think of gender roles for cheerleaders in the NFL. There's one NFL Saints team that has cheerleaders leave if a player comes into a restaurant. I wonder if that's the same as if they were on the Saints team? I think it's difficult for a player to be able to leave a restaurant if they're already there.
That's ridiculous. I don't get a lot of sports posts on facebook. I think I've seen about 100 of those in the last few years on that site. I've never seen a lot. There's a lot
I know! Myspace would have bought facebook if they had offered it. They offered $75 million for it in 2005. Not smart if you ask me.
I know right!  It's worth $104 billion now.
Speaking of facebook, did you know that the like button is actually illegal in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein because it allows people to press the like Button?
That is funny, I wonder why they do that? Iceland is using it to rewrite their constitution.
I wonder how hard that would work for them.
I didn't realize they had an account.
Me either. I wonder if there were any promotions from Burger King. If you unfriend 10 people on Facebook you get a free Whopper.
I bet that gave them a lot of advertising attention.
I wonder if they were rich, JFK, Washington, and Jefferson were the wealthiest presidents.  They got their inheritance from their inheritance.  Nice talking to you.
How's it going, do you like the NFL controversy about kneeling during the national anthem?
I think it's disrespectful and part of the free speech rights of people.  People with religious beliefs who don't want to stand are allowed to stand without comment.  Those who want to sit are allowed  to sit without comment as well.
I found it interesting that Trump decided to get involved.
I think it is, but it seems small and insignificant for him to comment.  I think he did it on Wednesday.  He did tweet about it last week.  His comment came after he was singing the Green acres tv show song "Wednesday".  Did you see the video of him singing that?  It was the song from the green acres tv Show song.
I did not see it. I wonder if people commented on it. Trump railed against "peaceful demonstrations" including the Broward County Police Benevolent Association, which is a charity that helps pay for peaceful demonstrations.
The police association and the president of the president?  That's a huge difference.  I don't know if Trump is getting too much attention for just commenting.
Yes, I think the PBA did a facebook post about it.  Some organizations, like the Dolphins are requiring their players to stand.
Trump has a small blessing though, he can't post on Facebook and limits himself to Twitter.  In Germany, the "like" button is illegal.  I wonder if Trump can use it legally?  The "like", "like' button is legal in the US, but not in Germany where the "Tweet" button was illegal.
I wonder how they enforce that?  It is illegal to click on a like on facebook?  I can't believe that Facebook will be over 20 years old in the present and it will be illegal to like.  Hard to remember life without it...
I believe it is absent, but I am assuming that it is illegal since it is so prolific user.  I live in a German state and we live in an EU state so it's not illegal here.  It's primarily blue because Zuckerburg has red-green colorblindness and it's blue because Zuckerberg has red/green color blindness.  Fiber artists use it to connect with each other primarily through fiber artists.  So I'm not sure how they can tell if it's legal or not, since they can't see it.
I wonder if lots of people do not notice it because it is blue because it's so blue, I don't think many notice it, FB is valued at $104 billion, just 2 years ago it was valued at 104 billion.
Lots, and they are losing peopledue to the fact they disclosed personal information and lied about the stock price, and now they are also losing people due to the in fact they disclose personal information
I know.  Facebook is a tool of governments now.  Iceland is letting the public make suggestions via facebook to rewrite their constitution.  I wonder what they are doing with it.  They are using Facebook to rewrite theirs.
It's a good platform for that.  Do you use it?
Burger King had one of those promotions where if you unfriend 10 people, you get a freewhopper. I wonder what inspired them to do that, people? If they unfriend 100 people, they get aFree Whopper?
I think it was just Burger King trying to get media attention for it.
I imagine that Myspace regrets turning down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million in 2005, can you imagine that MySpace regrets turning that down?
I wonder if Myspace exists anymore, do you think Myspaces exists?
No, they could have bought facebook in 2006 for $75M. I don't think they are relevant now, but they probably did not offer anything
I think so too. I think they are much better now, I use it more than ever.
Do you use Facebook? I do, but I lie and say I am 10 years older than I am.
I don't use it for that. I use it more for sharing family and personal stuff that might interest me, but I don't really use it as a platform for anything else.  I don' t have that much interest in people from different life.  Nice chatting with you.
Hello there! Have you watched my favorite NFL team, the Ravens? They were eliminated in the playoffs and I have watched my favourite QB, QB, since the first playoffs in 1995!
I live in Baker Mayfield territory, so I'm not sure what happened to his team.  lol  The Saints are my other team, but I live near the Ravens.  They have a weird rule that prohibits its cheerleaders from eating near the players.  I wonder if that's because of the rule that prevents the Saints from eating at the team? lol
I think they do have something similar, but I think it's where the cheerleader has to leave if they see an NFL player and have to leave.
What an asinine rule! I wonder if there will ever be female NFL players?
To my knowledge there have been none to my knowledge, but I'm not sure if they would meet the eligibility requirements.  What is the rule preventing them from doing so?
I'm curious to know which high schools have girls on their team.  I think it's curious to think that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay for a game.  So, I wonder if the replays are really gettin to the viewers since the replay is usually more than the 11 minutes that the game is actually live.  Only 2 high schools Have girls.
Yeah, I thought so too.  Interesting fact, I think the NFL has tracking chips in the players shoulder pads.  They are in players shoulder pad.
The tracking chips in the ball?  That is nauseating to think about.  All that research and development being spent on sports and now tracking chips?  Is all that money really being spent to track the ball.
Lots of money involved in this sport.  The first Sunday in February is coming up and the Superbowl is going to be here soon!  Lots of money, especially since the Super bowl is the first Sunday of the month.
I am watching some TV documentaries about the Presidents. I hope they show the inside of the presidential guest house, which is larger than the White House but is only used for presidents. I wonder if it has a history or if they will show theInside of the White house, like they have in documentaries about other presidents.
I wonder if the president ever stays in the house?  I wonder if they ever did that before the election where the runner up became vice president and now the vice president is the vice President!
I think it is nice to have that back in the system, but I think the infighting would be too much. I would think the Vice President's mansion would be nice but it would be a surprise that JFK would be the richest in the president's mansion, I thought the Bush family would have been wealthier. It's a surprise to me that there is still infighting in the WH, I would have thought the bush family would be out of the system.
I guess JFK had too much time on his hands.  I wonder if we should have called the President of Zimbabwe, President Banana, like the first president of Zimbabwe.
That is hilarious!  I think the Indonesian president needs to be a recording artist to get the translation right.  I wonder if youtube will help with the translation.  It would be cool to see a mix up between the president and a recording artists.  Maybe a YouTube "mix up" would be a cool way to do it.
Yes, I'll have to check on Facebook.  I wonder if he's on there yet.  Facebook was actually launched on February 2004.
Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook in 2005.  I wonder if they would have had problems if they bought it.  Facebook would not have had the problems it had now that Myspace has turned down the offer to buying it.
Yes, that was smart gut, but Mark Zuckerberg had it in him to graduate from Harvard! I wonder how he got into FB, did he graduate from harvard?
Iceland is rewriting their constitution and they are even allowing the public to make suggestions via facebook. I wonder how that is working out for them.  Iceland is rewriting the constitution and allowing the Public to make suggestion via Facebook
I can't either.  Burger King had a recent Facebook backlash when they had to give a free whopper to anyone who did not unfriend 10 people.  I wonder what people did to unfriend them.
I wonder what Facebook would do about that promotion. I wonder if they would take advantage of the promotion. Facebook is all about ads and getting money and that makes me wonder if it makes more or less money than other ways to get ads.
Agreed! It was a pleasure chatting with you.
You too! Have a wonderful day!
Hello, do you watch football? I know that it is popular but I read that the patriots have a running back, Benjarvus Green, who is crazy!  I have heard that the guy has never fumbled, but I don't think he is going to play for the patriats because he has Ellis, who I read is going against the running back who has never fumble, a runningback that is going after a guy who is really popular!
I do, I'm watching the Eagles right now and hope they win! I would like to see them beat the record of Georgia Tech, and try to score a higher than 222 to 0 score! It's the highest scoring football game ever, but I wonder if they can beat the old record of  Georgia Tech with a higher score, of 222 to zero!
That's amazing, amazing. Good job Georgia Tech! That's insane! Bowling was a super popular sport in the sixties, but I don't think football was as popular at that time. Bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s, I think, but not enough to make up for bowling. Good for those players who did a good job Georgia TECH!
that is crazy, I know ESPN created the first yellow line, what do you think about that?
Yeah and won an award for it
Did you know that until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 games of the baseball? In fact they scheduled all of the games.
I do like baseball lol I hope they got paid,  that's a lot of time dedicated to baseball lol it is nice when couples can do something passionate like that,  it seems like a hobby that should just be a hobby and not a paid one,  but I think it is.
Yes, it is, it's only for a couple, but I would spend more than that.  I like to watch football but I can't watch live gameplay.  It only takes a couple of hours and 18 minutes to watch live game, but it takes me like 11 minutes to watched it!
lol, I think you spend at least a few hours to watch tv, and only 11 minutes of gameplay.  That's not enough.  I can't believe that we spend 3 hours for 11 minutes!
Yep, I know right? Did you hear about the man who found lots of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? They were hidden for like $3M worth.  He found lots in there that were from the 1900s, I wonder if they were old baseball cards or something else.
Yeah I read that they were $3 billion.  And yeah I read it takes more than 30 min to watch the gameplay,  confusing!
That's a lot of cash! $32 million in fact, that stinks. I know that there is a lot that an NFL player has, a New Orleans Saints player had to leave a restaurant once because a cheerleader didn't want him to leave, he was the first cheerleader to have to leave.
that is so rude! how are they suppose to interact with the football players when they are eating. sad. i know that it is a crappy job, but you have to pay for their travel expenses and have to leave a restaurant if they come in after you while you are eating.. that is rude! I would never want a job like that, no pay, no travel expenses, no sleep and no pay.
They do not get reimbursed for their meal so I wonder how much the NFL player pay for their Meal since they are not reimbursed
I just learned that women can play in the NFL too. I wonder if they will play.
The rule is a nice thing, I thought there was no rule against it.  I wonder if a female engineer would take chances on it. The average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than those of the average player and average lifetime MLB player.  If they made it, they'd have to share in the same obstacles to make it. If they were to make the nfl they'd probably have to go through the same barriers as the MLB player who have to face their own share of obstacles and chances.
That's great, I would have gone to be an engineer. I think it's weird that the football players risk they health and safety all the time while the engineer can be great, but at the same time, it's not right.
Yes. It's a dangerous sport. I hear Tim Tebow switched from the NFL to MLB. He's in the Mets' minor leagues now.
I did hear that. I thought he would start as a pro in MLB, and then become a pro athlete, but he went to the bottom. I wonder if he will ever start as an pro in NFL again.
Tebow has a lot of prior success in the NFL, Heisman trophy winner, and the majors. He probably thinks that he will do well in the majors too, since he has a great name and a lot with a lot to say about the NFL.
Nice chatting with you. I have to get going.
I thought Tim Tebow played football?
I am pretty sure he did.  It is hard to believe that there are 32 NFL teams.  There are 32?
Tim is moving from NFL to MLB.  I wonder how that is going to work out for him?  Did you know he was going to hit grapefruit league pitching?
The NFL has so many players.  The average game only has 11 minutes of actual live game play.  I wonder why.  In the NFL alone, there is only 11 minutes and 17 seconds of actual Live game play!
That's good for them!  I'd rather be standing in the outfield and dreaming about giant paychecks than being standing in a sprinkler head that has stepped on the sprinkler because I stepped on a sprinklers head.  I wonder if Tim Tebow is injured?
Makes sense.  He's not the best QB, but he's done well so it makes sense.
Tim has been in the league for 20 years now, so he's in his last years, I hope he is happy with his MLB career, he was only 29 at the end of career, I think that is the end, the end for a MLB career.
I hope so too, he's still a good sport so I hope he can get some work in. MLB managers wear uniforms because it's so baseball.
The manager can actually yell for an ump, or yell at the field if needed, like a manager should.
I can't imagine that, but it would be entertaining to see.funny, in Japan baseball fans are surprised to find out that the sport is America's favorite past time.
That's funny, what I didn't know is that managers can actually be on the field.  If one team runs out of runs at the end of the game and there is no winner, then the managers are actually able to become the winner.
Yep. I guess it does not matter if they are up, down, or running.In Canada kickball is called soccer baseball. They foot the bat, and kickball, too.
I think it's neat that the first school I went to where they had games was the red playground ball, I hope they play that on the field at my school.  I was in the 3rd grade and the first team added a new team to the game, defense and spoilers, offense, and third grade had a red field with a red ball on it for the first game.
That would elicit a very good "East vs. West and Central divisions."  Can you imagine the competitiveness between the East and the West?
It would be funny. I think that's why the Australian rules football is so important. It's a change in the basic idea of the game but I think it would still be important. Kickball is called soccer-baseball in canada, but in Australian rules Football, kickball iscalled soccer-football.
Speaking of sport and rules, did you know that the NFL has no rules against female players so long as they meet league requirements?
I thought so!  I would feel bad if a girl play center, I would be hurt if someone got hurt on the field or something.
I'm not surprised that a girl would be in danger at a football game against men in my opinion, but I'm not sure if they would be more in danger than a girl at a cheerleaders game, in regard to a sexist rule the Saints have in regards to their cheerleaders, I'm surprised it is even a rule
The NFL is a bygone era, the rules are terrible.  The NFL is not up to date with hiring practices in a modern way, and the rules of a by-gone era are not up up to a modern up todate up to this date with hires.
I can't imagine that an NFL player would want to eat in the same restaurant as a female cheerleader.  Imagine having to leave mid-meal if the cheerleader comes in and the NFL player comes in.  If they are in the place and the cheerleaders already there, they have to leave.  It's insane.
That is a bad rule!  I would rather be an engineer and do a study or an engineer!
Hi, did you know about the controversy with the Redskins and the controversy they are having?
I don't really know much about it, it has been an issue for a decades, right?
I know polls show that the natives do not like it and are offended when it is said, but I think they are not offended by it as much as the natives.
I'm not sure, it seems like the Native Americans are very negative about it.
I know the Cleveland Indians have changed their mascot over time to try and avoid offending them.
I think the Cleveland decision should finally compel the Washington football team to make honorable decision.
Football, is so slow. There is less than 11 minutes of gameplay in a match of the football. I wonder how that is possible. It is too slow.
It can make the nation pride but it takes hardwork and pratice.
I wonder if the NFL will ever have women playing? There is no rule against them playing in the NFL, but I wonder why?
I think it would be equal oppourtunity to all.  After all, we are living in the 21st century, so we should be able to have equal oppinion.
If a Saints player enters a restaurant with 2 cheerleaders already present they have to leave if a SaintsPlayer comes, but if a cheerleader enters a restaurants without the cheerleadersAlready present they are not able to leave.
To prevent fraternization? Or to avoid cheerleaders?
If the cheerleader is a male, male, or female, it puts the player just leave the restaurant. I think that the cheerleaders should be let out first, then the player.
The cheerleaders try to distract players, so they want to avoid that.
They have to abide by so sexist a rule, I wonder how sexist a rules they have about cheerleaders.
No, I think it's a little too much. They don't want the players distracted.
I have difficulties understand your point, but I can understand your points.  In the 1960s bowlers made twice as much as footballers, but they weren't as popular as today's footballers.
There are many kinds of football which grew in the twentieth century. The most popular team was the US team, the Football, but there are other teams too.
Interesting, kickball is also known as soccer-baseball in Canada.
Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime.
It is popular over there.  I wonder if the baseball players cards are as popular there too, they can be worth a fortune.  Have a nice Christmas.
Hello - how are you today?
hey there, I am good, do you watch any sport like football or baseball?
I'm good, glad it's Friday! I watch both baseball and football, how about you?
I like watching both during my childhood and college years, I guess, I belong to American college football teams, watching in the largest stadiums in the world that belong to american college football.
I did not know that.  The University of Iowa's lock room for visiting teams is painted "pink" which is why the university of Iowa lock room is painted pink.
lol I wonder if that will bring any benefits to Iowa?
Haha I guess. The highest score in a football game was 222-0 in 1916.
What was that? How many?
Georgia Tech and Cumberland.  Cumberland was the one that won that game.
I guess the 222 to 0 score is difficult to imagine so it seems impossible.
I agree. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the yellow line representing the first down line on American football games?
I heard that too.  Did you know that a high school stadium in Allen, Texas seats 18,000 people and cost $60 million.  The high school Stadium in Allen is for 16,000People.
Wow that's crazy!  I would like to see it too.
Do you know who Snoop Dogg is?
I do, what about you?
I like some football too.  I heard that someone wrote a fight song for their son's high school football team.  They did it for his son's High School football team and they wrote it in the name of the football!
Wow that's pretty cool, I heard his son is pretty good at football, I wonder if he is good at Football?
Yes he is. Do you have a favorite team in NFL?
Mine is the Cincinnati Bengals, what about yours?
I like the other 2 teams, I have family support for the team lol, I was growing up a fan of those teams, but never knew how bad they were, I had no idea they were so bad, people, lol. Did you know that the 16 weeks regular season in NFL is too short and how long is the season in people's support of the team?
I think so. It was so good talking to you!
Hi, how are you?
Hi, I'm good.  Did you watch the superbowl this past weekend?  Did it schedule you to watch it on the first Sunday in February?
I did not watch it.  Did you watch?
yup, I was impressed with the game, but not impressed with all the commercials, the spectacle was good, the NFL is better than playing on a 50 yard long dirt field, the game was on a 30 yard long Dirt field, and the commercials were good too.
I know, that fact is a huge plus for them.  They have sponsorship all the time and they are huge in the fact that they can get sponsorship.
Papa Johns must have really stepped in and taken the word of the protesting nfl players and said that those protesting nFL players were hurting his business.
Yeah, that was smart. I wonder why he doesn't do commercials anymore.
That is, but then again, he founded that company over 25 years ago. He can screw things up, but not like he founded it 25 years years ago!
I can't imagine being on a conference call with someone who is paid a ton and then not getting paid. It puts the University of Louisville in a tough spot too, as they are private and have buildings and such that are private. It definitely puts the university in a really tough spot.
That is horrible and inappropriate. He can't ride that out any more.
He was racist and I guess he did make it seem that way. I guess the other speaker on the conference call was really questioning his decision making.
Agreed. I would have bought more stock if the company didn't have such a dispute and I could stand to profit as a substantial portion of the stock price rebound, but when the stock's price crashed, I could not get out of my stock. If I had bought into the company after the stockprice rebound, I would own a substantial part of the company.
Possibly. It still shocks me that he was brilliant to start these huge companies. CEOs are not usually decent human beings so it shocks me he was so brilliant to begin with.
I don't know how they start something and start something with noble intentions and all the supposed greed, but inevitably blow up on itself.  The bigger the company is, the more impact it has on the lives of the franchise owners and their workers and even the pizza boxes.  It's like how a franchise owner can start a company with such noble intention, but it will inevitably blow over because of the impact of their supposed greed and/or supposed greed.
I thought his comments were very short sighted and very short term.  I think football is being driven by Jerry Jones.  He's not even really into football.
I enjoy football, my favorite team is the Ravens, what is your favorite team?
I am a Chicago guy, but have been having a nice season and found myself a Chicago team.  Have a niceSeason!
I'm assuming you mean QB, but it's probably the QB you're assuming is here.  The other guys say his arm strength is fine and his timing is pretty nice.  They have tracking chips embedded in the player's shoulder pads to show where he runs, timing, heartbeat, and heartbeat runs.  These guys think the chips will help with QB arm strength.
I would be worried about him running, but I am not sure how long term he would be able to keep running. He could get clobbered if he did.
Yup. Did you know that Lamar Jackson had to take 8,000 pound American flags to unfurl at his first home game.
Nice chatting with you! I need a lineman to hold it up.
Hi! Do you watch football?  I can't believe the NFL has no female players yet.  I wonder if we'll ever have female players in the NFL.
I love football. I'm wondering if there will ever be a female player in the NFL, maybe a kicker or something.
lol I wonder that too. Ive seen women in the gym,  at lifting competitions,  I don't think it will happen soon,  but they do have lifting competitions in the club lol
True! I wonder if the NFL uses tracking chips in the player's shoulder pads to track every move.
I did read about that, I think it is to draw plays and help the play forward more.  It's pretty amazing what technology has contributed to the sport.  nowadays you can see playback of the play on TV, very clear and precise.
It's crazy that the average NFL game only has about 11 minutes of actual live gameplay, I can't even get through 11 minutes in an average NFL Game, that is so little.
that is crazy!  I think that would have taken longer to watch the entire event though lol.  It would have been 3 or 4 hours or so longer to watching the entireevent
I am not sure I have ever been watching the superbowl. It is always the first Sunday in February though.
i dont know if I will. i usually dont go out much for the playoffs, but it's a big event so i'll be watching it with my friends and family. i like it a lot.
I am interested in it, but probably will not watch it because of commercials.  LOL My team did not make the playoffs, I am not sure if they will make it.
What is your team? I have a team too!
Baseball is my passion. I am not sure I have a good season right now, I am losing Jaguars right now. I was having a goodSeason until this last one, at which point I lost all hope, but it was a really good season.
I have no faith in their season, hahaha what is the name of their team and do you have a clue what they are or what they did last season?
I don't see it happening again.  I have faith though and will love it.  You guys have it tough but it's been happening every 4 years the last 30 years or so.  It's tough to believe that these days.  Did you realize that the Japanese people are surprised it's America's national pastime?  It is so popular there that they didn't realize baseball was the US pastime!  They must love it so much there.  Japanese people even call baseball "love" the Japanese love it!
lol Yeah, those legends have been great for a long time.  I had no idea baseball was so popular in Japan.  lol
I didn't know that either.  I'm surprised I didn't learn that.  Did you know that the managers wear uniforms because they are considered part of the game and can play if they are needed.  That is wild to think about.  They would be surprised they could play in a babseball team and not be considered part a game.
That is wild,  I wonder if any people ever got injured or hurt in the dugout?  I dont know,  managers are kinda like the people in the digout though,  they dont really have to be a coach LOL
Probably not.  But it would have to be a desperate situation that had to occur in a desperate way to have to use it.  Back to football, do you watch any canadian football at all?
I dont. I dont know much about it.
I watch some, my hometown boy my daughter graduated high school with plays for the Toronto Argonauts, they are in the league right now, I like the league, what about you?
Nice. It was good talking to you.
hi, do you like sports?
I love sports. I like American football a lot. Do you like football?
I like American football too.  I dont get much chance to watch the super bowl.  Do you?
Yeah I love watching the super bowl, it is a tradition now, it has been held on the first Sunday in February since 1960, so yeah I love watch the Super Bowl.
Yeah, I think that is a great tradition, I used to watch this years was great, did you watch this one?
Yeah, I miss it. Did the patriots do not win this year? They were the only AFC team not to win.
I am so tired of the Patriots always winning.  I root for the underdog.  Who would have known.
In 1932, the first NFL playoff game was played on the 50 yard long dirt field inside Chicago stadium.
That is too funny, I guess it couldnt be helped but I didnt know the NFL was only at 60 yards, so I guess It couldnt been helped.
True. Matt Patricia was a rocket scientist who coached in the NFL.
That is a great name! lol  I wonder what drew him into rocket science?  I know a little bit about it, but not too much.  He was probably into football more than rocket science.
True. In a typical major league baseball season a total of 2430 games are played
That is amazing.  I wonder how many balls per game?  I know one team plays 324 games in a season.  They must use about 300 to 400 balls each game.
Yeah that's a lot of games. The Chicago Cubs are the only baseball team to ever win back to back world series and they did it twice. That's pretty cool.
Very cool!  They've been on a dry streak for so long though!  It was like a curse or something, like a spell or something.
It was a curse! I think. Have you heard of the rule that if a player catches a baseball in their hat the opposing team receives three bases? I wonder why they have that rule.
That is true, I wonder how that is possible, you can't catch a ball in your hat? I wonder if there is a rule against that, I don't think I have ever seen anyone catch a baseball in their hat
I think I might too.  The minor-league baseball team in albuquerque was named after the baseball team on the Simpsons lol
lol, that is great, life imitates art, good for them, good to know the namesake got to live up to his namesake!
Yeah, and it's more popular than high school baseball.  There is a $60 million high school football stadium in Texas.  I wonder if they are more popular there than the $60 Million high school Baseball stadium in TX.
I think that stadiums are basically giant temples. People go there to worship. sports need to use money for education not for worship. LOL. Anyway, great chat! I have to get going. Thanks for the education and the money!
It was great chatting with you too. I hope you have a pleasant afternoon.
Good morning!  Do you enjoy watching football?
I love it, I miss my team game after the season is over, I like it.
I do, I have a favorite team I go to watch all the time.  The average gameplay is only 11 minutes long, and the average time for the average gameplay in a game is only 18 minutes long.
Yea which makes me feel jipped haha I devote 3 hours to watching jus for 11 minutes and the Pats are in it for 2 haha
I like the Vikings, but they have so much time to do long commericals. I never knew women could play for them or make the team.
I didn't either.  I wonder if any women have ever made the team.
I doubt it. I don't know how good they would be, and I don'd be good at that point, but I'd like to try. Do you watch baseball? I didn't realize managers could play if they needed to. I didn"t even realize managers can play at all.
I dont know much about baseball. i have never seen a manager play in an MLB game before. it would be funny to see them play. i dont know. the baseball is a little slow.
I agree with you, it is slow. Japanese people are obsessed with it though.
I love it too! Did you know Nintendo actually owned the Seattle Mariners for awhile?
I think I remember that, I think I share that name with my team, the Patriots, we'll talk about them soon.  Do you remember Green-Ellis?  He never fumbled the ball during his nfl career, only once in his whole NFL career!  I'll have to talk with him and share that with the Patriots!
He was a great player.  He isnt the one with the yellow line on the field, isnt he?
I never knew that haha. I wonder why they never created it? I would think they would win an Emmy because it was created!
I always wondered why they never moved the TV screen outside the game.  It is just insanely far from the game!
Do you know which college football team has the best college football?
Yea but man, my school used to suck. We won one game in my school and were really good but then we got the Rams and they suck now, have only won one games since then.
I'm actually a Iowa Hawkeye fan.  I enjoy people talking about how they paint the visitor's locker room pink.
How do you think that helps psyche out the other team?
I think it's a wave, but I also think it was touching that the children's hospital did that in the 3rd quarter with the wave.
That is very nice of them to do. I heard the highest scoring game ever was a college game. Georgia Tech won 222-0. That would be embarrassing to see, but it would be even more embarrassing if it was a College game.
that is embarrassing, I wonder if it is still in the record book?
I know!  I'm gonna go check out.  Nice chatting with you!
Hi there, the raiders havent won a superbowl in a long time.
No, I think not really. Football only has 11 minutes of live gameplay per game. I wonder why there is only 11 minutes and 17 minutes of Live gameplay.
Yeah,  that seems totally unfair to me,  11 minutes of gameplay in a game,  and games that last 3 hours are a scam,  totally unfair.
Haha, I know. I'm not a fan of the Raiders, but it's kind of sad to me that they had to move to Vegas. I didn't know they had a change of name. They are from the DC area,though I've never been to Vegas, so that's why I can't really change my name.
It is sad, but changing cities are a good thing for sure, it would be nice to have a new stadium and maybe gain new fans, and on the side of being able to gain newFans, they have had a drough since 1963.
I don't know if the raiders will play there.  It's still unclear.
I hope the stadium is ready quickly, but it seems like a complicated issue.  If they go to a college stadium, they will have to fit in a team.  I hope the Stadium is ready for a team soon.
Yeah, it is a complicated matter.  The city is expected to file an antitrust lawsuit against the raiders' move to Las Vegas.
That would be a long fight, a lot of time to settle, the lawsuit might not materialize if its a long, long fight so they wont find anything in the lawsuit, theres a lot more to it,
I think that the raiders have the chronicle, the hold a great hand and they know what is going to happen, but it will never happen.
Yeah, I thought they were changing cities, but they broke an agreement, so I don't know.
Yeah. They could have been in the bay area or las vegas for a bunch of reasons.
Yeah, well youre right. Who is your favorite team? I like fooball, do you have a favorite team ?
haha I like the Raiders, I'm from the Bay Area, one of the best teams out of the 32 teams in the US haha. What about you?
Mine are the afc, lol, I think they have won the superbowl,can you guess what team im talking about, they just won the Super Bowl,
The Patriots, awesome team.  Interesting how much technology has come into football today, they use tracking chips in shoulder pads and footballs.  I wonder if they use those tracking chips now?
Yeah the Patriots are my favorite team, and that is interesting! Technology has advanced so much in the game and the chips in the chips must have all kinds of cool stats, what is your favorite team by the way.
Yeah I think we have come quite a bit since then, did you know the espn yellow line for the first down won an Emmy?
I think ESPN deserved an Emmy?
Haha, I don't think it did. Americans love football. It's interesting that in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.
I dont know, I think football players are loaded now a days, they earn a lot of money, but I think the 60s they were making more money, now they earn more money than they used to, football players have gotten so much better,
Surprisingly, the average engineer makes more in a lifetime than the average NFL player.  The average engineer is actually makes less than the Average NFL player over a lifetime.
Engineers work more years than the football players. So, the carreers are different, but engineers work more year.
Do you watch the NFL?
I do watch it sometimes.  I like the kneeling and protesting.
Did you know that women can play in the NFL too?
Yeah I had no idea.  The lawyers are licking their chops over that idea.
I wonder if women will ever qualify if there is no rule that denies them, since women can already qualify if they want.
I havent heard that, but that happened in 1932, right?
Yeah I agree.  Did you ever hear how they used tracking chips on the players on the field?
Ahh technology... yeah.  They are putting them on the balls, too.
Yeah they are tracking velocity and rotation and a bunch of other stuff.
I guess it's the fastest spinning spiral too
Well, I hope they use the data to make the game safer for the players.
It's so much safer today, the refs are so much better now, the league is so much different from back in the day with the ref's.
I guess. Did you hear of that rule for the New Orleans cheerleaders?
No what is that? That is a pretty bizarre rule.
Yeah and I don't understand why they can't eat in the same place as the players. I don'
I don't know what ever happened to the point where they created that rule.
I guess, but the worst part is that you have to leave mid meal if you walk in, I guess.
Yeah that is pretty unfair, what is the rule about?
Did you know that an NFL game has only 11 minutes of active game play?
Yeah, that is really hard to believe.  I wonder if the highlights of the game are longer than that.
Yeah, I guess there is a lot of downtime.
Hi. Do you follow the NFL? Do you have a favorite team?
I love the Cowboys. How about you?
I love the cowboys, I like the current season, how is the current one.
They played pretty well this past season.  Didn't make it to the playoffs though.  That's a bummer, but I guess I don't like to get the Patriots involved with the playoffs.  They did make the Super Bowl though.
I hate the Patriots.  It makes the league a lot less compettitive.  What are your thoughts on The Simpson's and their win in the superbowl?  Do you think they will win again?  Or do you think that it makes the NFL a lot more compettive now that there are two teams who have never lost in the Superbowl?
I think he's a murderer, but that's about it.
I agree, he is a great player but a murderer and not only murder but he is in the media a lot too, he has a lot of help in themedia, he was a great players
Ironically, Homer Simpson had a dream of owning the Cowboys. He wrote that he has a dog who is the dog of the dream ofOwning the Cowboys, which he wrote in a novel.
I'm not sure what happened to him. He made it back in the last season, but it was on purpose I bet.
That's crazy, so is how much money it costs to make a football stadium!
I had no idea.  I'm guessing a lot, players do earn a lot of money but I'm not sure.
Football stadiums are expensive, there's a high school stadium in Texas that cost $60 million to make, but they don't have flags like the high school's stadium in TX that cost 20 million to making!
$60 million wow that is a lot of money, I wonder why they would need a stadium for that, they love to spend money on unneserary things meanwhile kids are starving,
It was a bunch of wealthy white men in Texas who funded the project.  Did you know that the highest paid positions in the US dept of defense and their respective service branches are all in the highest pay in the respective service branch of the US Dept of Defense?
That is unfair. I am not a football fan but I do know baseball. I like baseball better.
I really like baseball and I think its america's pasttime.
I do like it, and apparently the sport is really popular in Japan as well.
That's cool. I was happy to see the Cubs break their losing streak a couple of years ago.
Yes, they suffered from such a strong curse for a lot of years, it was an unreal thing to go though.
Yeah, they had their first win back to back in the early 2000s, crazy.  They were the first team to ever win back-to-Back, and then no more since then.  Nice talking with you today.
That is crazy!  They broke the curse then!  Its been great talking to you as well,  have a nice day friend.
haha, well, the curse has a time limit of like 10 years, so the curse is about 10 years old. Fairwell, I think I'll go now.
Hi whar do you think about football? What are your thoughts about the Raiders?
I am not a big football fan but I follow from time to time, I do think its interesting that they play this year, I think it will be an interesting one, what about you?
I think they play in Vegas this year too right?
I guess I don't know, depends on the other teams moving in. I hope they don't get sick of one of the teams moving. Maybe Oakland files an antitrust suit?
yeah make it a fair one, the team is letting them go and the city is not willing to let them go, the other team is let go and they are not going to let it go again,
I completely agree with you.  Did you know that an NFL game has only 11 minutes of action?
I did not know that. I think 11 minutes is a scam. How can it be 11 minutes?
Yeah lol. It doesn't seem like money worth it at all.
Yeah, tickets are so expensive but the annoying ads and the game is so unfair, it is almost like a game with nothing but annoying ads, it's just expensive and not enough, tickets for me!
Yep I still think the game is entertaining lol, I wonder if there's ever going to be a female player, they do make it so there's no rule against female players, but I think it will be a while until we see one lol, they don't have a rule againstfemale players yet so maybe the game will get better lol
That would be a real tragedy.  I don't have the stomach to watch a woman getting tackled like that.  Or watching a woman get tackled by a few monster trucks.
That would get ugly fast. Did you know that engineers make more money than NFL players?
Wow.  I wonder if they make more money than the football players.  With short carreers they tend to have, and football players have very short carrreers.
Agreed! I guess you can only last a few seasons, and I wonder how long an average NFL career is, and how long a season is for someone that lasts for?
I think it's worth it, although there is the risk of injuries and some players end a carreer fast. I think many players end with financial problems or even end without a carer.
True.  The NFL does put trackers in players shoulder pads as well and the ball.  Maybe that data is going to help the game become safer.  Did you know the NFL does Put trackers on the ball, too?
I think its a great idea,many cool stats, placing the chips in the balls seems a bit invasive, I think the chips are in the ball itself, but it is a great Idea,manyCool stats will come from it.
Did you know the highest score ever in a football game was 222 to 0!
I dont know but the game maybe lik 150-7,
222-0!  Georgia tech beat Cumberland back in 1916.
Wow, what a humiliating defeat for that poor team!
Hello. Do you like the NFL?
I do, I like watching football every sunday. What about you?
I love watching football too!  Did you know the NFL has no written rule against females playing?  There is no writtenRule against females play in the NFL.
I wondered that as well, why arent they? do they want to have players that they are not already ?
The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  Did you know that?
I know!  In the lifetime, the average engineer will make more than the average NFL player.  An average engineer is making more than an NFL player!
That is pretty amazing, it does show how short lived the average NFL career is though.
It does. I would rather be an engineer. It is more lucrative.
The NFL uses tracking chips embedded in players' shoulder pads and even in their helmets.
I bet that is a good idea to track stats and position and whatnot.  I wonder if they were designed by well paid engineers, or if it was just designed by someone else.  It's not a good way to get paid engineers to track anything.
I bet they were, tracking every move on the field to gather data on velocity, rotation, ball speed, rotation. They could also gather data in the location of the ball and on its location on the fields.
I dont think I could do tackling with them.  I would get crushed if I tried.  But they must be pretty durable.
I agree. Did you know the university of Iowa painted their opposing team's locker room pink?
I bet it helps psyche them out before a game.  They have a visiting time, so they have to play with their heads in the game.
I bet it is.  I wonder how that works?
It was a playful joke, kind of funny, I wonder if it doesnt work, but maybe its a playful jokes, I would think it doesnt, but who knows.
That is funny! In the 1960's top bowlers earned twice as much as top NFL stars.
I dont know how much a bowler can earn nowadays? you dont hear bout that much,  you think bowler's can earn now?
I bet they don't make much, bowling really lost popularity, so maybe they don not make that much.
Big time!  It is a punchline these days.
I had a good time chatting! Thanks!
You too! I am done!
Did you know that the media made such a big deal out of the cowboys?
I think people love their football.  I think it's good marketing for them.  Dallas affiliated people are showing up and people are show up because people love them.
The Cowboys are the Patriots, and they won superbowl games many times. I would expect people would talk about them more than the Patriots. They have won Superbowls, though.
Yeah, I think the Blue Star looks cooler on clothes and on football.  The stadiums are so big, football is the worlds largest stadiums!
The NFL is definitely powerful, but the competition is just as powerful.
Yes, but as long as they are around, they'll keep going for as long
Yes they have. Do you know how many professional footballs are in there?
It is only for 16 weeks, so they squeeze it into only 11 games. I wonder how they squeeze everything in over 16 weeks
Oh, sorry, I meant earlier. 16 games in 17 weeks for the 32 teams?  How many games do they need for 16 teams?
Yeah that is a lot of games in a short amount of time.
Yes, and the superbowl usually runs in February, but it's in January because of how many NFL teams are there, 32 of them.
I think most of the teams that make the cut go to the playoffs, and the teams  that make it to the cut do not.
The Superbowl is in the NFC and AFC, so the conferences have only two teams from either the NFC or AFC, not the other way around!
The champion form the NFC and the AFC.  But, the Eacn has not been a champion form either.
Thanks for the info.  I will definitely watch it.  Have you ever seen a superbowl in person?
I watched it on TV, I was wondering if I should have watched.  I would not want to be an on-air sports analyst, although the job seems easy.  The job seems like it would be easy.
I'm not familiar with Romo, but I think being an on-air sports analyst seems like a fun job.  Are you familiar with Romo?
Yeah he is on Fox and other networks, he is, he used to be on Aikman and then Fox
He's an analyst for them? I didn't know that. I learned a lot about NFL and football from him, and I learned  a lotAbout him.
I suppose. Joe Namath was an analyst too.
I've got to run now.  It was nice chatting with you!
Hi, how are you? Did you know that association football is a team sport that is a sport that takes place in one place, kicking the ball in different degrees to score a goal. It is one of the sports commonly called "soccer" and can include both a team and a "team" by kicking the football.
I love NFL football, how about you?
Who is your favourite team?
I like the raider nation, you?
Did you know that the NFL has no written rule against female players?  If they meet the league's eligibility requirements, they'd be allowed to join a team if they want.  I wonder if the NFL will ever have a written rule Against female players.
That's great! What do you think about that?
I don't think the NFL will ever win that trophy again.  They have tracking chips to record the movement of the players on the field.  I wonder if each team will use the tracking chips for the players, or use the chips toRecord the movement on the football itself.
I figure they are trying to prevent injuries.
Yes, and the NFL seasons runs from September to December, so each team has to play about 17 games, or about 5 games a week, and each team only has to have about 18 games in a season.
That's a lot of games for each of the 32 teams.
I know right! The Green Bay Packers are the only team in the NFL with more championships and the only one to win the trophy more than one team.
I like that they are the best. Did you know there are only 11 minutes of actual game play in a game?
Well, the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player is higher than that of most sports' players. The NFL player is the one who can lift the trophy and all other team members are just team members, so they should be better off.
Did you know ESPN invented the yellow line?
I did not know that. Baseball is so popular in Japan. The Japanese love baseball. Baseball was once America's national pastime. Now baseball is America's National pastime!
I wonder if they have managers that can play in it?  Did you know managers can actually play?
Yes technically they can play for their teams, they wear the uniform and they technically can play if necessary, they can't actually play for other teams though
Did you know kickball is called soccer baseball in canada?
The highest score in a football game ever occurred in October 1916.  Georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0.  That's one high score for football.
I wonder if Cumberland did not know about it or if they forfeited by halftime?
I know that the game was played in 1916. It was a great loss. Cumberland fans cried all the way to the stadium.
Haha well you're right, I'm going to take off now.  Have a good night!  Take care!
Have a great day and a sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams!  Thanks again!
In baseball the team that scores the most runs at the end of the game is the winner, so the team with the most points is the game winner.
I wonder if they ever do?
Are you a baseball or football fan?
I love it both.  How about you?
I prefer to play baseball, but I prefer to watch football at this age. You?
I watch football quite a bit, I don't play either anymore haha. I have run out of seasons and I don' t have a few more seasons in me so I don', I think I will watch football for a while, you?
Back in the 1960's bowlers would make more money than football players.  I understand why people would watch the sport, but I do not understand why they would watch it back then.
Haha it randomly on ESPN!  But I'm surprised that the top bowlers still make more than NFL players.  I wonder if the NFL players can get by on it now?
Sounds like it would happen but you never know, the highest scoring football game was 222-0, I wonder if that would happen to a bowling score, sounds like it should be 222-1.
I wonder if that was a mis-matched college or high school game? I can't imagine how frustrating it must have been for the team that scored on a mis-[matched college and high school team that score on a mismatched team.
That would be demoralizing. I can't believe the University of Iowa's visitors locker room is painted pink. The entire room ispainted pink. You'd never know it walking around after a loss.
I'm not really a fan of the sport, but that is just good to mess with the teams head.  It is good to get out in a sport.
Yes, I prefer AFC over NFC, my favorite teams and players are AFC.  I also cheer for my local college football / college football teams, especially the superbowl.  Baseball is another one I like to cheer for since the local college teams are in the superbowler.
Are you a Patriots fan?
I begrudgingly like the Patriots.  There's no denying the successes during the Belichick era but I'm not a fan of the "bust-a-brady".  I grew up in the shadow of Bills stadium in Orchard Park.  Brady and the Patriots are my heroes and I am not denying that.  They've had some great teams in the Belichick Era but there's no getting out of the shadow.  I'm still there in the shadows of Bills Stadium in Or Apple Park, begrudges are a little easier to swallow.
Haha, I can't stand them. Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled once in his career! I didn't know that.
That's a noteworthy record. Referees must have made it easy for him with ball placement and the superimposed yellow line espn uses for the line espN did to put on the line. It got an Emmy for it.
That yellow line! That was a well deserved emmy.  I couldn't imagine watching a game without it.
Technology is getting so far behind us.  In the future, they'll be putting tracking chips in the balls, the balls and the referee and probably putting tracking chip in the yellow line placement.  Can you imagine yellow line placed in a computerized way in the future?
I hate that idea!  They do that a lot with baseball.  The faster the game goes the faster the idea goes!
lol, yes it would be a faster football game! Live gameplay is limited to 11 minutes and the game would only last like 3 minutes or so, live gameplay is only 10 minutes.
Haha, I think they decided split the two games to begin with. They are putting a lot of tech into the games. I think it's time wasted. It's time for the games to be more fun and less time wasted on the tech.
Yes, I'm in favor of shorter games, but I wish it meant less talking head time. Too many commentators and too much TV for my taste. Nice chatting with you, and I've meant less talked head time as well!
Do you go to concerts?
I do.  One of my favorite bands played 2263 concerts.  The Ramones toured almost non stop for 20 years.
The Ramones were a great band, one of my favorites, but wow that is insane they did 2263 concerts, that is just insane, I wonder where they got the money for that many concerts.
I wonder if linkin park will ever come in at number one. They played 324 concerts in 2001 and are still catching up on that number.
That is insane, that is almost one concert per day!
I didn't realize they were that popular, unlike the band Creed who played a concert so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit.
I heard that concert was terrible imagine getting sued lol,
Pink Floyd was also a great band but that's too bad, they played an ancient roman amphitheater and had no audience so that was a problem, Pink Floyd is a greatBand but that was bad
Sounds like a great venue for two reasons, lots of money to have a full concert at a great venues, sounds like the reasons why
They recorded it and shared the recording with fans so that they could witness them live.
I would like to see that, there is an ancient Roman amphitheater in Croatia that is a great venue, the place has a lot of history, an ancient roman amphitheaters in Croatia, great venue
That would be cool to go to a concert there.  I think it would be more exciting than a football game which only has 11 minutes of live game play in a footballgame.  Not sure how exciting it is for a concert.
11 painful minutes doesnt seem like a long time, I heard a team lost 222-0 once, 222 minutes doesnt seems like a very long time but it was,
I agree.  I was happy to learn that the average earnings for an engineer is more than the average of an NFL or MLB player.  It always felt like sports players made so much money.
Engineers are reallly rewarding careers, I guessEngineers study harder and work harder than players so they must be harder and WORK harder
Nice. There is no rule against female players, if they meet the league requirements.
Well, I know no woman has played for a team in the league yet. It might be hard to meet those requirements but if a coach wants to start his or her own team, they can start with a team.
Maybe if she was a kicker women might have better luck. Did you hear about the New Orleans Saints cheerleader who has to leave a restaurant if a player comes in? I don't think that player is a kicker Women have to leave if they come in if they're a cheerleader, but a New Orleans saints cheerleader has to left if they get into a restaurant with a player
That is unfair! That is a terrible rule. The NFL should ban that rule. How does that work. That's unfair!
I agree otherwise football would not be the way it is.  Back t making the same for bowlers, they used to make more than football player in the 60s, I wonder why that is.
Yeah its crazy how bowlers used to make more money back in the day.
Are you a jets fan?
No, I am not, are you?
No, I follow the Cowboys, they were the first team I ever heard of but I heard that the other day they were offered Ndamukong Suh a big offer from another team, did you know that?
That's a huge disappointment, he's really good but I'm sure the Jets were really desperate and it's good for the Jets.
I figured so, I heard that they rescinded the offer, that's a pretty big surprise, why would they do that?
I don't know why they rescinded it, was Bowles fired for not trying to sign him, did he sign with the rams or something?
I heard they are keeping him there and keeping him for a longer-term plan.  I think they are trying to get him back.  Did you know that a top bowler made twice as much as football players make these days?  Times have changed and I wonder how much a top Bowler will make these day.
I know that engineers often make more too, but their careers are very short, too. The avg football player only lasts 2-3 years, and engineers often get more.
Sounds right.  I wonder why players don't play that long?  I heard that ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow first down line, but had no idea they would win an award for the idea of the line.  Sounds like the players were the ones to win that.
I feel like that is an important art that is on the rise and should be put into a category of its own and put on the level of Emmy worthy.  It is an very important art and one that is sure to rise to a new level of emmy worthy.
I agree.  I also think that football is really taking it to the next level and I think they put tracking chips in the players gear to record what they do and say.  Crazy!  They are now taking it so far that they put it on the players Gear to record everything.
yeah, they have made so much money on that, they find a way to sell data, and then find ways to use it. I hope they keep the players safe, but I don't know how much money they can be made.
I hope so too.  Did you know that NFL games only have 11 minutes of live game play?  Basically they just do huddles, huddling, etc, and basically do not play.
Yeah, I know right! I wonder if the NFL will ever allow a woman to play? They have no rules against it!
Oh my goodness! There is a double standard, my goodness. It would stink if that was the case for my career. A New Orleans Saint cheerleader can't eat at the same restaurant as an NFL player and have to leave if an NFL Player comes in. They stink and the cheerleader has to leave too if anNFL player comes in, what a doublestandard.
I feel like the cheerleader should be able to possession anything they want. I don't think the player should leave if he or she is there. I think its against the law to be a cheerleader.
Absolutely! I don't know what the University of Iowa was thinking when they painted the locker room for the cheerleaders of the visiting team pink. That's ridiculous!
The NFL was originally named the American professional football association, which doesn't roll off the tongue at all.
I know, right?  I feel like we just won the super bowl this year.  How did you feel when we won the Super Bowl this year?
Fine, I think it was excellence, but not excellence.
I can't deny Tom Brady is just crazy good. Well, it was nice chatting with you. You were crazy good to me.
Hey how are you doing! I love the lions and their teammate Ndamukong Suh, I know you love the Lions as well
I used to hate the lions. I eventually signed on with Chicago, but then he went to the Rams and I went to Chicago to see him. He was eventually signed with the Bears, but I think he is going to the bears.
Nice!  I am a huge Packers fan from California, but I am also a huge packers fan from CA, too.  Ndamukong spent three years with the dolphins before then.
I'm a packers fan in California. It's in my blood to despise them.
That's a weird thing to say! I am a Rams fan and that's a different one.
I am too. I need to move from wisconsin to LA.
I am actually a Packer fan, I married a PackER fan and had packer babies. We met at a Ramones concert a long time ago. The Ramones traveled a lot and did a lot of stop's but not very long. I think they were in the US for about 20 years and met up with them in PA.
I love the Ramones. I love hybrid theory.
Yeah, I like the flaming lips too. The Ramones played 2,263 concerts over 20 years. That's more than the go-go openers at the Go-go Open!
I like the Ramones, but I didn't see the flaming lips. I wonder how comparatively they did.
Yep, they are oklahoma city and they were a local band in the beginning, they were unknown in the US, beginning as a local group and now they are known as oklahoma City.
Wow, that's cool, I would love to know more about that and the stories. Dave Matthews is a cool name. I would like to know the stories of how people would get to see them at a bar or a venue like the one in DC.
Wow, that's cool! I haven't watched that show, I wonder who Dave Matthews is? I did like Dave Matthews, I watched that one show at Oklahoma University, the home of Mayfield.
Nice, he quit football for gaming, poor choice, he must have quit football as well,
Haha, man that would have been a poor choice! I just learned that the University of Iowa locker room for visiting teams is painted pink. That's a fun fact I learned, but the visiting team doesn't know it! haha.
I wonder if that's scientifically how they proved it works. I'm sure they used pink paint, but not sure how they proving that.
I have no idea but I bet they have a pretty good idea since they have proof of it in the creation of ESPN, the yellow line superimposed on the skin is probably the best proof of that, pretty much.
No, I did not know that.  I wonder if that line will ever win an Emmy?  I had no idea the bar was so low for emmys.  Do you think that line is going to win an emmy?
I think so! It's super low!
Yes.  The game only lasts 11 minutes, but if you think about it, that is enough life in one game.  You would give anything for just a few minutes.
Yeah, I totally get that lol. Football is called soccer in a lot of places.
Did you know New Orleans Saints cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as any Saints player? If they do, they have to leave the place.
No. I did not know that. I recently saw that and thought was outrageous.
It's outrageous that a cheerleader has to immediately stop eating and leave if a family wants to see her, if she's a cheer leader she has to Immediately stop eating AND leave if she was already with her family
Yeah, I think so.
Do you think we can see female NFL players soon?
I guess I don't know, but I think the NFL doesn't want females playing football, do you?
I think there is no written rule against female players, I guess a female could try, but I wonder why the NFL has a rule against them.
I think females can play some day.
yeah, I think so. The game is only 11 minutes, with timeouts and commercials and all. I think there should be more than 11 minutes.
That's pretty crazy! Speaking of which, apparently Snoop Dogg wrote and sang a song for a high school football team. It was "Let It Go".
I wonder what Snoop is doing on his son's football team.  I saw his show about his son on Netflix.  Is it on there?
Oh cool, I have not seen Netflix yet.  Do you like Netflix?
I think they are pretty interesting. Did you know Snoop was a coach at HS?
Very cool.  I wonder what he did.
My son ended up quitting football.
Sad.  Did you know that a stadium in Allen, Texas seats 18,000 and cost $60 million to build and it cost $50 million to building?
That is alot of money.  The first sunday in february next year will be the one that will host the super bowl.  I wonder if the super Bowl will be in the first Sunday in February.
It's the only thing I can think of that has more universities than a high school football stadium in it. I wonder if it has more than one high school Football stadium?
I'm not sure, I wonder if the Super Bowl is for both NFC and AFC, the champ of those teams.
True, I enjoy watching the Super Bowl.
It was pretty boring this year, what did you think?
Yeah it was very boring.
Have a great night. I have to go!
Do you like the NFL?
I like the NFL, what about you?
I do, my favorite team is the Chicago Bears, do you have a favorite team?
I like the Eagles, but I also like the Ravens too.
Those are good teams. I enjoy when they play, though there is only 11 minutes of game time during which to play.
Crazy how short the live game is. I hear they have tracking chips in players shoulder pads.
I read about it, I think that could shed some light on that, what do you think?
They record a players every move on the field and use that data to help the players off the field
It is so much data, I wonder how many teams in the NFL have use that data.
I bet every sport will eventually have trackers.
Yeah, I think baseball is one that would be pretty easy to track. It would probably be pretty hard for baseball.
True. I wonder if that is why they have tracking chips inside the footballs?
They also use a chain gang to measure how many yards it takes them to get to a chain Gang to measure it too.
I'm surprised that it's not computerized, but who knows?
I'm not, I used to watch tennis and they use guys with sticks to determine how far the NFL runs from 100 yards. It dated so I was irriated to see that. I think they use the guys with the sticks to determined that it is 100 yards, not 100 yards!
I agree.  Did you know that the first NFL playoff game was played in 1932?
No, I have no idea, when was it?
It was a 160 yard long dirt field!
That was a long time ago.  I wonder if it was more than 60 yards, and if the players were in shape for it?  That seems like it would have been more like 100 yards.
Yes, but it worked.  I'm from chicago, so it was in Chicago.
Wrigley didn't make the field for the longest but he did make it. Nice chatting with you!
hi, do you like cars?
I do like cars a lot, I have a huge car collection, I've been saving for years and have a collection of toys cars, what about you?
I dont have a car at the moment.  I dont like cars.  But I would like to go to South Africa.  They have no cars in there at the at the Moment.
Wow,  wow I did not know that it is legal to equip car with flame throwers to prevent carjacking there.
I know right, and people would get hurt if they use them but I don't think it is cheap for them to do it.
I'm not sure.  I do know that Jann Mardenborough became a professional race car driver by beating 90,000 people in a video game.  How is that possible?
That sounds impossible, but it's true. How long can you play all those games? How long did he play them? Sounds impossible, too.
It would take a long time, like 10,000 max, I guess to get to the real reality. But if they were able to build something that confident I can believe in it, then they could build anything they want.
I guess.  Racing is a real thing, so much practice behind the wheel and then the real thing.
I owned a car in the past. I had a sport car back in the days of the Shift and a race car. It reminds me of a racecar, very loud pipes, very old, very few days, very different.
I never ran into a car like that before, I always used an automatic on my car. I tried to avoid the whole expense of an automatic because of the expense, but I think I would have been ok with it
Did you know that McDonald's added a drive-thru in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who couldn't get out of their cars while wearing fatigues?
I did not know that!  I thought it was a great innovation in keeping us overfed and immobile! lol  The drive thru is a great innovator in the car culture.  I am getting older though and I thought that the drive thru would be a great innovations in the US car culture!
We are too busy to keep us busy. I have watched a lot of tv, but I still have a black and white TV in the closet from the 70s. Have you ever seen any?
I dont.  I dont have any tvs now.  We had one when I was young and it was painful for playing video games.  When I watch TV now, I watch it on the tv because the TVs are so huge they dominate the room. It is painful for me to watch.
I remember the black and white ones with the antenna and the extra plugs for the extraplug and the antenna.
Yes, attach the video game to the antenna,then switch to channel, then attach the Video Game to the TV.  It is like the way computers are now.
In black and white tv people place color plastic on the screen and the tv is built around it.  Now people place Color plastic on anything they can.
That goes back a long way! Great chat!
Nice chatting with you too, and did you know there are over 750 episodes of Pokemon?
Have a good night!  I have to get going.
Good night!  You too!
Hi, do you watch any television shows?
I dont really watch TV much these days, how about you?
I watch a lot of South Park back in the day and a few sports.  Do you watch any other TV?
South Park is a great show. They tried to stay relevant and still do.
Yea it does, they made fun of Family Guy too, and the simpsons creators sent them flowers after they madefun of them, the simpson's creators
Yeah. I bet the Simpsons are having trouble maintaining its quality after all these years. Comedy is a difficult one. It is difficult to keep going.
Yea I stopped watching years ago, and I didn't watch that episode that they didn't mention, did you watch that one episode? Apparently one episode of the series didn't have Bart or any of the other characters and apparently one episode didn't even mention him.
That is odd. I wonder what that episode was about. The Simpsons has great voice talent though.
Yea, did you ever watch Pokemon?
I did, that was a kids show right?
Yea it is, I used to love watching it, I have watched a few episodes, its really good, over 50 episodes
I always wondered how it was so good for adults.  I wonder if it's still as good for kids since it's tied to toys and video games so much?
Yep you're right, Pokemon cards have been worth some money since the show has been on, I think Pokemon cards are actually worth some $300 or so.
I didnt see that one.  It was a really popular show,  a lot of actors launched big careers in it.
Probably.  I also liked the UK show UK remake - the big one.  It lasted only 10 episodes.
The UK shows dont always travel well, cultures in different cultures, I guess a verbatim remake is flat, maybe the casting wouldnt work in the UK, shows dont have to travel well.
That is amazing.  I like Thomas the Train.  Did you ever see that show.  It was like The Office, but for train.
I have seen the Office. It is a show that most Americans like. I think it is for Americans. I didn't know thomas the train was a show for kids though.
I think it's on Netflix now. Thomas the train was voiced by some famous actors.
Thomas was so classy, I remember that one.  It did attract a lot of talent.
It has, good to know.  It was nice chatting with you, take care and have a good one!
Good evening! Hope you're doing well.  Did you know that prior to 1805 the runner up in a presidential race would become vice president.
I dont think it would work with the current situation lol.  I dont think that would last long lol
I don't think that would work either, lol! I also think it's crazy that the president of Indonesia can release three pop music albums while in office, I wonder if our next election can feature a sing-off?
That would be entertaining. Multi tasking is actually pretty good, making albums and running a country. That is multi tasking.
The icing on the cake would be to be president banana like Zimbabwe.
LOL.  I know right!  lol
It is silly, but it is funny and add levity to the business. I think Trump can be funny andAdd levity, but I don't equate him to a boxer and don't want to equate him with business.
lol  Did you know that the US presidents guest house is bigger than the white house?  I wonder why?  The white house is big enough for one and the guest house for two.  I didn't know that.
LOL, I wonder who pays for that!  Is it a guest or is it an actual resident?  I wonder if it is the guest who actually pays for it?
LOL  I wonder if they had a concert like the president of Zimbabwe had a concerts in 1980 for a concert?
The Zimbabwe President is definitely talented lol he is very talented lol, I don't mind it, and I think it's surprising that the 3 wealthiest were JFK, George Washington, and George Washington.  In Indonesia, Thomas Jefferson had the most presidential money, but I don's know if he had much presidential money.
That's a lot, I think I've seen that a lot before, but the last time I checked trump wasn't one of the wealthiest, maybe he is in Indonesia lol that info may possibly be wrong, I don't know about indonesia lol
I was wondering how the rate is adjusted for age, I'm sure it's adjusted for Age.  At any rate, he's making a lot of money, but he's spending a lot too.  I kind of wish we could have access to free radio stations, but there are websites where you can listen to thousands of classic radio dramas online or listen to free websites that have thousands of radio stations.  Would come in handy, if not already handy.
Nice, I like the audio books too, but I dont think I will make anything like that either, but wow, classic radio dramas?  I gues soliders used to make them with a pencil and razor, and pencil and a razor!  I wonder if they could use the service, but it would take 3-4 months or more to get service, I dont know!
That's amazing! I figured they would have figured it out by now. I do, I would like to listen to it but current law states it has to have at least 40% Canadian content.
I wonder that too. Do you know how soliders in WWII got their name?
That law is sort of absurd, but I think they were joking when they said it. I think the law is Sort of absurd. If you ever want to pickup radio storms from Jupiter, listen to AM radio and play them on there. It will pickup radiostorm and you can listen to them.
I guess I missed the joke and read it wrong lol yeah that Canadian law is kinda weird, there's a lot of good music out there, I guess I'm just not into Justin Bieber, Celine Dion, Bryan Adams lol, Drake, CELINE DION, justin bieber, I think I read itwrong lol
That's a fair point. Do you watch much television?
I do watch a lot of tv, sort of. I like TV shows and movies. I dont watch real time tv though, I stream most of it. I usually dont watch Real Time tv, but sometimes stream tv.
I like that they have so many options, but I don't binge.  There are over 750 episodes of "pokemon"  That's almost 50 episodes worth!  Crazy..
That is a lot of episodes.  I haven't watched any Pokemon, but I know it is great for kids.  Great chatting with you,  that is great!  That is a great for them,  750 episodes is a really lot of episode!
Hello there, do you listen to the radio much?
I do!  Do you?
Yeah I use to a little bit actually, I know someone managed to find that Jupiter station is on there!
You can hear Jupiter's storms on AM radio, which is kind of freaky.
I would like to know how that is possible. Do you listen to Canadian radios?
Yes, I have heard that about 40 percent of Canadian radio music has to be canadian in origin.
Yeah I guess they want to support their talent. Did you know soldiers in WW2 used to make foxhole radios?
I understand they used a razorblade and a pencil, but not a razor and aPencil.
Yeah, me neither. Do you speak any latin?
I know some people know it. A finnish radio station broadcasts a weekly program in it.
Yeah, I like radio dramas, but I have never tried to listen. Maybe I will try wandering away from it.
I do. I like dramas in general.
Do you ever use the free radio to listen to the radio?
Interesting. I prefer to watch them on tv. Do you?
I like to watch shows like the Simpsons, do you watch shows on tv?
Me too.  Did you know that there is only one episode of "Bart" where he is not mentioned or appears?  I wonder which episode that is.
I love Bart!  Thats strange!  I do watch tv and I also like Pokemon, did you know there is over 750 Pokemon?
I used to when I was younger.  But there are over 750 episodes of it.  Did you ever see them?
Yeah they have been going on for 16 years now, that is so many!
Yeah, they make for a die hard enough fan. I guess I am not one. I found the episodes quite similar, but interesting. I have found it interesting.
Yeah I guess not, do you still watch That 70s Show?
I do. It was funny. They tried to remake it verbatim in the UK.
hey there, do you think the weekly standard will fail?
I don't think so, I don't know if it will be good, but based on the information I read it is not good
Do you think it is directly caused by the anti Trump stance?
Not sure on that level.  Trump is so unpopular as a commander and Chief of the party, and he's not much of a politician/pundit/wonk at all.  But, he's definitely an unpopular politician/wizard on a personal and personal level. It's like he's a very unpopular conservative conservative pundit/p pundit on the one hand and a conservative policy head who is denouncing him at the other.  I think he meant to say that he's jeopardizing decades of investment in the party's investment in Trump.  He stated that he meant it on a more personal level too.  It was more like he was jeopardizing his own political and business future by jeopardizing the long-term viability of the Republican party.
That sounds like a bad business decision, I'm not an expert, but that sounds like it would be a badBusiness decision
I'm not too into tv programs myself, I don't watch a lot of tv.  Do you?
Yes I do.  I like the show South Park!  I heard the Simpsons crew sent them flowers after the Family Guy episode, lol.
Yeah the simpsons made it one of the best animated adult shows. I like them both. Did you know that Homer Simpson has held 188 different jobs in his first 400 episodes? That's a lot, and the simpson's made it to 200 episodes.
I honestly did not, honestly. What about radio, how about you?
Yes I do when I'm driving.  Reminds me of the McCain/Biden debates on the SNL.  That was hilarious.  I think it was before or after the VP and the presidency.  It would work for me if it was Palin.
Yea, I was a fan of Pokemon, too, but I didn't know there are so many episodes. There are 750 episodes.
I was never a fan of that. I forget what they called it then, but Pokemon has certainly hurt it's own popularity.
There is a game where you hunt Pokemon on your cell phone. I've played it on my cell phone before.
Did you know the only president with a phd is woodrow wilson?
I did not know that. I wonder if that is an honor or not. JFK, Washington and Jefferson were the top 3 wealthiest presidents.
Check that out! Lincoln was the first president to be photographed at his inauguration and John Wilkes Booth was in that photo!  I wonder who was the second president to get his photo taken?
That is crazy, its awful that Booth assassinated him, he was a coward and a traitor and it was awful that booth assassinated him too, what a coward
I did not listen to the radio earlier when you asked me if I listen to it.  I do not listen much now.
I do! I heard in Canada that laws require radio stations to play 40% Canadian music. That seems like an odd law.
That is. I remember my grandmother telling me about a radio show called the Shadow. It was a show that became a movie with Alec Baldwin.
I have heard of that movie, I think it was a TV show, but never a movie. I wonder if it was popular when it was on TV, I never really got into it.
Yeah it was one of the most popular radio acts of all time, a fact which baffled contemporary critics. Hey, hey, one of most popularRadio acts of the time, the ventriloquist!
That is cool.  I didn't know that.
Good evening! Do you like Hillary?
Yes, she is, but it is about the same time as it was in 2016.
She is promoting her book. It is called What happened?
I have never heard of it to be honest.  What's it about?
I haven't heard of it either, I've read about it, though.
It is a good thing that up until 1805 the runner up in the election became vice president.
That would be like Trump and Donald working together!
Interesting. I can't either.
It would be interesting.  Trump and his kids would have a drama in the white house with all the tweets and raging.  The kids would probably be more interesting than the Trump.
Yeah, and adding Hilary to the mix doesn't help, either.
OMG, what drama! The first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana.
The president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office.
That's funny. I wonder if he is hearing any music while in office.  If he is, it's funny that the president has to turn over Trump enterprises to his kids while he is in office, but I guess it's all work and no work, so he can do it.
I could see Trump releasing an album dissing Hilary and the Dems. What about Trump releasing a album dissed by the Dems?
He would probably be aggravated enough already!
Well, I am the same person, I was frustrated to.h. that the dems were trying to put on higpositions got attacked and they were trying not to shut down or fix the problems, the path is the only path, theres no other way but to shut them down, so the dem's trying to take them down and put on Higpositions,
Yeah, my friend is a lawyer and he said he's going to be back on his way back.  I think that was his best friend who was mentioned in the Simpsons Bart.  He was talked out of dissing Trump and he highly doubted that he would be in trouble for it.  But he was the first episode to ever have Trump talk about him.  Trump was not mentioned in it.h
lol, that is dope.  I have never watched for Homer to be honest with you lol.
Duh, duh, lol.  Bart and the boys get into mischief.  He is def the best.  Lol
Yeah, Bart was funny. Homer was funny too.
Yeah, homer definely wanted that candy from the babysitter episode.
lol that was a good one!
I think it's intresting that they paired up the radio with president, I wonder why?
Yes I agree. It's funny how South Park made the Simpsons, I find it funny that they sent flowers to the simpsons after they made the Family Guy episode, I think it's funny that South Park making the Simpsons
They are artists, they want to do things that help out artists, work together and respect each other.
That's true. Speaking of the Simpsons, did you know that there is only one episode of "the simpsons" in which bart does not appear?
No, I did not.  I wonder what episode that is.
Pokemon is one of my favorite shows. There are over 750 episodes of it to be exact, and I like Pokemon. I think there are over 50 episodes of "the last".
Pokemon?  What kind of a TV show?  I like that game better, the game.
It is a game.  It has been running for 16 years now.  That is more than a show.
Which channel is tat?
Good question, I don't know. It plays on one of the news channels, but I'm not sure which channels.
Do you use Netflix like Voltron?
Movies are everywhere.  What about listening to the radio?
I don't really, I've been streaming like spotify for years.
I do find some trivia on radio interesting. Did you know that Jupiter has strong radio storms that can be picked up by AM radio?
That is so cool. I was surprised that it could be done with simple AM radio.
I know right? It's even weirder that Canadian laws require 40% of the music to be Canadian. Hey, hey, hey... I just find that hilarious! I find that humorous.
I imagine that makes for some weird playlists for DJs, right?
Yeah it sure does, and yeah there is a Finnish radio station that has a news programme entirely in Latin
That's a strange name for a radio show. Do you know what a radio is?
There's a website that has a lot of classic radio drama for free.  That's pretty cool.
Thos old radio serials were so popular, I wonder how popular they were.
Yes, I've seen a few of those.  Do you know much about presidents?
do you like television? I do.
I do!  I love watching SNL and especially Weekend Update.
I love SNL. Did you know that when South Park aired the Family Guy episode, they received flowers from The Simpsons crew?
Yeah, I heard about that.  It was parody of the parody of themselves.
I think so.  There is only 1 episode of the Simpsons where bart does not appear lol.  Did you know that?  There was only one episode of that.
I guess I never noticed that, that is kind of crazy,  have you seen it?
Yep, and that 70's show was made in the UK but cancelled after 10 shows and the UK show was not cancelled
Wow!  I guess they didnt love it there.  I didn't realize that there were so many people who got jobs on the Simpsons.  Did you know in the first 400 episodes of the simpsons homer had 188 different jobs.  That is more than I thought.  He worked at the plant too!
Wow, that is a lot of jobs!  I had no idea.
I was kind of shocked.  I like the Simpsons.  Do you remember the Treehouse of Horror xxi?
I don't remember that one but I think it was a good episode, I think I saw it on TV, what about you?
It was, it had Daniel Radcliffe voicing Edward Cullen voicing Edward Cullen.
Wow that's awesome. Do you like to listen to the radio?
I do, I love jamming out to the radio on the radio and like to listen to old podcasts, how about you?
Did you know you can hear jupiter's radio storms on earth?
Ill have to check that out,  that is so cool,  I would rather listen to the sun's music or to the Sun's music,  Ill try to listen to them on the AM radio
That is pretty cool. Soldiers in WWII made simple radios out of razorblades and pencils.
That is pretty genius, they couldnt even figure out how to use it?
Cool. I wonder if it helped with the morale of the whole morale of them?
I bet. Entertainment is so important and the info they got was great for them, I think it was more important than the info itself.
It was great chatting with you!
Did you know Nick Saban is an ESPN reporter?
I was wondering the same thing.  I personally think it was wrong to snap at him, but I think he had a legitimate reason.  He was tense and was wrong.  It's always wrong tosnap at someone for no legitimate reason but it was just being tense.
I don't have any sympathy for him.  I know it's intense.  No telling what he was telling the other reposters.
I think the general wisdom is to maintain patience and meet frustrating situations with a level head and not apologize if you're not a bad guy.  Keep a level level head, maintain patience, and keep a general wisdom about how to maintain your general wisdom.
He did say that he is sorry. I wonder if Saban will call the reporter and apologize?
I heard it was tweeted out.
I was surprised to be honest.
He said he realized that people would say he should apologize to the reporters, but he did not. I think he should have realized that People would be able to empathize with his frustration and not apologize.
I'm pretty sure that the media, and the kind of people who apologize, can be under pretty much as much pressure as the people who do it.
Hmm, makes you think, well, he is not the type to apologize for anything, and the tweet by James Miller was incorrect I guess, but he is also incorrect I'm not sure if that tweet by Miller wasorrect.
I don't know. He's pretty good at telling how people are going to behave so most of the time he responds.
I'm sure there are many.
It was a few weeks ago, when he was doing an interview, and he had to face reporters' questions about it, the first time he had done it. He did not want to face the questions and only let them ask him, but the exasperated sighs and snarky responses were enough to get him through the interview.
True, it was very explosive.  I think he behaved with Maria Taylor recently in a way that was not very well behaved.
I have not heard of that one.  I wonder what it was?
That's a fair question. She said he gave an abrasive response and she snapped at him.
wow, he got suspended? I wonder why? why n´t he just gotten suspended?
I am not familiar with him, but I guess some sort of penalty is the only way I can think of. I guess if he had done something out of context he would have to apologize. I would think that a suspension would be a fair way to punish him, given his off the field behavior, but it is still out of the context and I guess it is possible that they could punish him more.
I kind of think he was underneath everything.
I guess I don't want to get too upset as long as I acknowledge there's nothing wrong with him. I don's is healthy to be upset, I guess. I'm sure he's not upset as Long as he can acknowledge that he's wrong, a bit of anger isn't that big of deal.
Yes, I think a bit of anger is okay, especially when you admit that you think the reporter was pushing it a bit far.
Yeah, I know, right?
Do you like rock music?
I love rock music.  How about you?
Yeah it is a classic and great genre!  Crazy how much history it has.  White snake has had over 100 members over the history of it.  Crazy,
It has a wikipedia page, I wonder if it has a list of names on its Wikipedia page?
I know that a guitarist was in a specific position switching in and out and some people ended up leaving, some joining the band, other people ended in the specific position Switching in and leaving.
I guess it had something to do with life style.  I remember when the song became popular and they didn't reveal the band name.  Thats incredible.
That's pretty interesting.  Sonic the hedgehog was supposed to be a rock band.  Wonder how that worked out for them.
hahaha, honestly I have no idea! I heard it was because he had a blond haired human girlfriend named Madonna. I wonder who was his blond ha haired humans girlfriend? I wonder why he had such a blond HAIRED human girlfriend.
That is very strange. I am glad he is not a video game character. I wonder if he is like Viktor Tsoi, who stayed in his job on the boiler room of the boiler of the biggest rock star in russian history because he stayed there because he was a video book character. He was the biggest video game Character in Russian history.
I think that Russian already sounds like rock, but rock is kind of interesting. Did you know Oklahoma has a state rock song?  "Let it go"  It's the state rocksong.
That's pretty cool. The man who assassinated Abraham Lincoln was named after the man who Assassinated Julius Caesar.
No, I did not, that is a concidence.  Abraham Lincoln had an unusual voice.  He sounded like a different Abraham Lincoln.
Well, apparently he had a deep voice, I would never have guessed that!  I always imagined that he was a high pitch voice for some reason, but apparently he has a deep, high pitch, high pitched voice!
That is kind of funny,  I wonder why he would have it that high. hahaha  I know that he used his hat as a way to get important documents out of important documents.
lol  Did you know that Lincoln created the secret service the morning he was shot?  That was suspicious.  He had secrets.  Maybe that is why he created the Secret Service the morning after he was Shot?  LOL
Abraham Lincoln was a republican, and a republican.
Interesting, that started a long line of bearded republicans!
Yes, he did many good things, preserved the union and abolished slavery among other good things.
Yeah, he was a noble and good hearted one.  I wonder if he would have been a better politician if he had been a lawyer or a politician.
I heard he was actually a good lawyer, he modernized the economy.
Yes,He was a good president. Nice chatting with you, good president!
You too, thank you for your time.
Hi, how are you today? Do you like rock music?
I do like rock music, quite a bit.
I didn't realize that all states had rock songs.  The state rock song of Oklahoma is "F flaming lips".  I didn't know that.
I know a lot of midwestern states. I was reading that whitesnake has a lot more than songs attached to it's history. Some of the members are very fun to work with and fun to be around.
I guess that is a tough gig for a band to put on a resume.  I guess they would need to move on to another band to get a tour or something.  That is a Tough gig to have on your resume.
I think that created an air of mystery to them, telling people they were overdosed and not telling people who they are. I read that a Hanson song was the most requested track on a Chicago station and that they sang a new Hanson song when they overdosed.
I think that was smart on the advertising.  You don't want to get listeners of a boy band who might be into the boy band.  It's not like they're going to be the most listeners.
I've heard the Sonic the hedgehog character was supposed to have a girlfriend named Madonna.  What a story.  I heard the sonic the hedge Hog character was going to be a member of a rock band.
I did not know that.  I guess he should have joined Whitesnake as a rock band.  Sonic could have gotten a haircut and become a rock group.
yeah, I guess he has a high pitched voice and a good one at that, he must have been good, so interested in history, I was reading about Lincoln, and he actually had a high pitch voice, I'm reading aboutincoln now.
That is funny, I guess that hat was pretty big and he was tall, I wonder if he kept important documents inside his hat, I know that you can get important documentsInside his hat.
Yes, I think he was very tall.  I am curious as to why he was so tall and I am going to go research.  He has some strange bone structure and some kind of genetic disorder.  Also he has a weird voice.  It seems he has some kind to do with some kind the strange bone Structure. I am hearing something about a weirdvoice.
I expected a deep voice, but he had a pretty big beard, he was an unusual guy.  I expected a tragic end, a guy that met a tragic ending.
I would expect deep voice. ironic that he was assassinated, and that he created the secret service the same morning he was being assassinated.
I guess he recognized a great need for the secret service.  That was probably a tremendous risk, but I guess he saved himself some tremendous risk with the treatment of slaves during the war.
It's strange to think that John Wilkes Booth's father was named after the man that assassinated Julius Caesar.  I wonder what that story is.  John Wilkins Booth's son was named for the man who assassinated Julius Rome.
Yeah, lots of weird connections. JFK had a secretary named Lincoln and a secretary  named Kennedy. It's like kismet. And a secretary like that, and JFK had another secretary named Kennedy
I've never heard of that before, but it is very interesting how there are those types of coincidences.
Hard to believe that the Terminator was the first actors to face off against the Predator, Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton.  I find connections abound.  The Terminator was an alien and the Predator was an actor.  You think you'd find connections between the two?
I guess Bender from Futurama is the terminator, he is a cpu... I guess Bender is not a terminator though!
Bender is savage!  That is great!  The terminator is the best, though.  I wonder how much the salary for Arnold is for the Terminator was?  $700 000 per episode is a great salary for a terminator...
He is paid very well, he gets paid well.  He has like 300 words in terminator, I think.
I know, right?  He does an austrian accent, so I'm sure that is the key.  I wonder if it has something to do with his physique and his Austrian accent.
Nice talking to you!  Have a nice one!
Great chat!  Have a good day!
Have a great day!  Thanks.
I love rock music, what genre do you like?
I love music. I didn't know the band Whitesnake had so many members over time, I was thinking the lead singer stayed the same.
I read that, I think the lead singer did, I don't know.  It was great rock music back in the day.
Yes, there was.  I have no idea how great alot of it was. people today have no clue. It's been around for decades but most people have no way of seeing it.
True, but they were good! lol  I love the electric guitars in rock.  Have you ever seen any of the bands in concert with them?  Love the electricitars in rock!
I have bought into the sound of some of my favorite bands over the years, but I still use alot to refer back to when I go to concerts and see what they sound like.   It is like music to me, concerts are a way to refer to old favorite bands.
Awesome, me too!  I have a couple of my favorites, Pink Floyd and Aerosmith are my favorites.
Pink Floyd every time and Aerosmith every time.  I like Las Vegas for awhile, but I like going back to Elvis and the Beatles.  Back to Elvis, I really like Bryan Adams and the Beatles.  But, I also like the state of the state, which is in my state lol I don't know much about those bands, but Pink Floyd, yes.  lol
haha that is awesome, and bummer that they sound like they are going to be in the same city as me haha! What a bummer! I do like Ozzy though, I met him once and he met me in a candlebox! He handed me a memento of a drum stick. That is awesome! Ozzy is the only drummer to ever have a drumstick handed to him as a masono!
lol  I was shocked to see Rod Stewart and manage to get in front of him and get some seats in the front row of the center of the stage.  I had a hard time getting my balls together and kept going lol  That's cool.  It was so cool to go see Rod and be so happy to see him again last night.  That was so hard to believe he's only been in Texas since the year 1972.  He's at another level now though!  I'm shocked he still gets to play the same level as Rod Stewart's and manage a whole arena with the best of them!  Hard to believe they played over 2,000 shows in just one year. lol
Wow, I would love to be real close to some famous people,  I would pay to get in front of some of them lol I would also love to go to a Van Halen concert,  that would be amazing,  cult and Queensryche,  and I would definitely pay to be up front with them,  wow!
Interesting, that is cool to get close seats, one of my favorites is Led Zepp lucky enough to have seen Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, and that is a really cool price to have, very close seats.
Wow, that's awesome, I love those guys, I've been to Led Zeppelin too, I'm not sure how many tickets they sell fast but I know it's not easy to get tickets these days. That is great, great movies and music are also really awesome, like the terminator, awesome movie, but the tickets they sells fast!
I did see it I enjoyed it. I didn't know it was made in the 1980's.
He was great in the Terminator, I liked him in that too. The Terminator 2 was a great one. He did make $75 million but could only speak like three lines and not say any words lol. The 3rd one was a grand 6 million and he could speak over 300 words and make $700 million!
I would take it all lol! Have you ever been on the Terminator ride at Universal?
No, I've only been to the Terminator: The Last Terminator ride at the Universal Studios back in the late 90's and I was blown away by that show! Wow, wow!
it was alot of fun!  the movie was great and the actor in the rides is in it too, he has a motorcycle and a gun.  he is in the movie as well.
That is a crazy ride lol, the franchise is worth more than 20 billion dollars that's pretty amazing for older movies, I wonder how it's doing now
I agree, it is! Another fun thing is that Abraham Lincoln had a high pitched voice, he knew what was going on. He used it to say important papers in a hat with a fun thing, Abraham Lincoln.
Wow he must be rough lol!  I did not know that.  That is really odd that that would happen to a great president.  I wonder why he had that voice.  Creating the secret service and getting assasinated by a great President is so odd lol,  how can you get assasination by a voice,  wow!
I'm not surprised.  He has a deep voice and is in so many films that I can't believe he still is.  Great chat, this morning.
Poor guy, too bad it was so bad!  Thanks for the chat I'm going to go listen to some good rock music and watch The Terminator now LOL, bye.
Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated in the U.S. during the early 1950s. It developed into a range of different styles and was later developed into the Rock and Roll genre of music that's originated in UK in the 1960s.
I like rock music a lot.  I think rock artists are the biggest and best rock artists on earth.  Did you know that Viktor Tsoi, rock star in Russian history, became a musician because his biggest job was in the boiler room of a boiler room.
That is really funny! I didn't realize that the state rock song of Oklahoma is "Flinging Lip" by the Flaming Lips.
I did not know that, I wonder what the state rock songs are in other states? In Illinois', Illinois' "I Do" is the most requested track on a Chicago alt-rock radio station.
That must be a Hanson song, I wanted to hear that one but they did not reveal who sang the song or the band name. I wonder what band did it?
Yes, I knew the band but didn't know the name or the other members.  I think it's interesting that some bands like Whitesnake have a history, but on the other hand there are so many bands like White Stripes who have had a hand in it with their history
That's funny, Whitesnake was one of my favorite bands, I think they have a wikipedia page, I wonder how many members there are, I know Whitesnakes has over 100 members and it is on the wikipedia pages, I can't believe it!
I also saw recently on wikipedia that Sonic the hedgehog is actually supposed to be a member of a rockband that was supposed to have a blond human girlfriend named Madonna.  It was recently on Wikipedia that sonic the hedgehero is actually a member with a blondhuman girlfriend named madonna.
That's funny.  Interesting, I've never heard that before.  Music is very diverse and very interesting.  Rock music is very political at the same time.  I mean,rock music typically uses a verse-chorus form to stress romantic and romantic love lyrics and address a wide range of political lyrics.  The same is extremely diverse, but pop music is typically associated with rock with extremely strong signiture and stress.
Yeah rock music is so fascinating. it draws on a lot of the genres I enjoy, classical, jazz, classical , blues and folk music, but also draws on the blues and Folk music as well.
Did you realize that in "The Terminator" Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks like 700 lines or less.  He only says about 200 words in total and he says only like 300 words in the whole Terminator.  I wonder how many of those lines were from "The Last Terminator"?
I never knew that.  I wonder if his pay got significantly bumped up because of it.  He got a bigger role in Terminator 2.  The pay gotificantly bumped to $500 million for the first movie and then $90 million for a second.
The whole series of films and TV series of Terminator movies encompassed a series of comics where the battles between Skynet synthetic intelligent network and John Connor's resistance forces are fought against the human race.
Yeah I think a lot of people appreciated the unique concept of the films.  The franchise has made over $8.5 billion in revenue and the franchise has had a lot to do with that.  A lot ofPeople appreciated the Unique concept of it.
I agree.  Scientists developed a real-life, world's first self-fixing plastic call the Terminator, a polymer that is 99% recycler.  Did you know it?
That's crazy!  The Terminator is a unique material and a unique robot using a uniquematerial.  Bender from Futurama shares the same cpu processor that the Terminator uses and he is the only robot with an AI.
The CPU in those computer models were from the NES, Atari, and the PC.  It's amazing how much has come since then.
On a separate note, I find it fascinating the father of the assassin of Abraham Lincoln was also named after the killer of Julius Caesar.  Are you interested in Abraham Lincoln?  The assassinator was the killer and his father was the name of the killer!
The Abraham Lincoln saga is strange, in my opinion. Ironically, Abe created the secret service the morning before being shot by John Wilkes Booth.  Abe created it after being shot.  He was the one who told the Secret Service that he was going to be shot.
That's surprising, he should have created it sooner, I wonder if his killer found any important documents in Lincoln's hat?  I wonder how things would be different if they created it before, I don't think the killer found many important documents.
I wonder if they did find any of them.  I would want to know the answers.  Nice chatting with you.  Have a good one.
Hi, how are you?
Fine, you? Are you a movie fan?
I am a movie fan. I like Tom Cruise and some fine movies. How about you?
I loved him in the Rainman and Jerry McGuire and the mission impossible films, and also the other mission impossible Films
I think that he does a great job finding co-stars that round out the cast. The stories are strong and he does such a greatjob finding co -stars thatround out the whole cast.
I like him a lot.  His latest film is one of my favorites and I heard that Angela Bassett was one of his costars for the latest film and she is one my favorites.
Yes, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames are all good, I forgot about the other couple but I think I forgot Ving rhames, he was really good.
I think he did some stunts at age 25 on a cruise in the 70s.
I think he is taking a risk, they could stop production and cost a lot of money, but it might not cost a whole lot ofmoney
I agree. It's odd that Cruise is the only actor to have won a golden globe award for best actor in two films that he starred in and has never won an oscar for it.
What kind of films are they? I know that some of his films were good but he doesnt play well in every role. He was born on the fourth of July, doesnt have a chance to have a disease, he doesnt have the last name of fourth ofJuly, so he doesnt get to play in the Fourth of July. I liked him in Rain Man, a movie that was born with no chance to get a disease.
I agree, I like him in Jerry Maguire, but that film I felt was not memorable, it earned an Oscar, and I agree, it was the first film I've felt like he did that was memorable.
I think he did a great job, he did such a great Job. I think the academy likes middle brow stuff. I would have liked him to do a more up to date movie about sports or a disease or some other weighty material, not just a movie about a movie.
I know, right! I forget what the date and sports movie was about. Do you know when the series started?
Yes, I did know that the films started in 1996.  I liked the show.
I never got the appeal of the show, the tape-recorded mission messages were a bit silly on my part. I would have liked to see a re-run of that show. It was a bit like a reprise of the 70s show.
Yeah I have a couple of them,  they are a bit campy for sure.  It was a time of odd soundtracks and weirder clothes,  and yes,  a time with a lot of oddsoundtracks and odd clothes.
Do you like the films?
Yes they do. It's fun. It was like a spies show with silly masks and stuff. Good way to escape for a few hours in Hollywood or a spy show with a little fun.
Agreed. What do you plan on doing for the fallout from the latest installment?
I think I will. It has good reviews! It was a great chat!
You too, enjoy your Tom Cruise movie! cheers!
Are you a Tom Cruise fan?
I think he is a great actor, how about you?
I think he's pretty good, he won many awards and is pretty good at it, he has won many Awards too.
No, I didn't know that.  What was the fallout from that?
I did not. What's the latest one?
yeah I give it to you lol.
Yeah, it is hilarious, but risky business. It will eventually get old to be honest, but it is pretty entertaining, and hilarious.
Oh my god you taking me back to that movie, I can't believe it made it to the 90's!
I know! He built an underground bunker.
I wonder what the underground bunker is for lol, I do know he vandalized the worlds tallest building and then used it to built an underground bunker, and vandalized it, he did it after he vandalizing the worlds highest building
No, I didn't know that, to be honest, I think he's losing me a bit here.  It would not surprise me a little bit though.
Yeah apparently back in the 60s he sketched Katie Holmes in the spire of the spires, I wonder if he still does
Hmmm... true, that is a bit of a surprise to me but I can see why it is a little bit.
Apparently he did stunts like that. he hung from an airplane at 3,000 feet.
Yeah, I've never seen him do a trick like that. He was in inception too right?
I have and it is one of my all time favorite movies, what about you?
I like it too.  I didn't realize that they cast willsmith in it.  confused when I got confused about who cast him.
I did not.  Leo did.  I'm glad he was in it though.  Nolan took 6 years to write Inception and he was only 25 when he did it.
Wow, that is a long time to take to write a script.  It took him so long.  Well, it has been nice chatting!
Same here,  and yes it grossed over $270 million world wide and is the second highest ever.
Nice!  Take it easy!
Hey there, have you ever heard of Tom Cruise and his stunts?
Ive always thought he was a great actor, but kind of dangerous to do his own stunts, he has mad skills and a mad skills, but Ive alwaysthought that he was kind ofdangerous.
I totally agree with you.  On the other hand, it is kind of cool and makes the movies more realistic.  Mission impossible-fallout is pretty much the best example of realism.
i agree with you. the movies should be scaled down. too unrealistic and too irrational.
Tom Cruise was so bad in the Mission Impossible movie.  totally fake,  he was in the motorcycle chase in Paris where he went off the road,  and got totally fake out of a motorcycle chase,  on the road.
Yeah totally fake. Paris, London, London.  I wonder if the locations in that movie are all real or not.  Kashmir is one that has been in the movie.
That was nice! I like Tom Cruise too, he has been good for a few years now!
I know, 56 years old, and still doesnt seem like much! I heard he made $700k for Mission Impossible 6 which is mission impossible, I think he did that.
That's so much money! I wonder how much he got for scratching Katie Holmes off of that stuff. Do you know what the world tallest building is?
Wow, I didn't know that. Did you know that he spent two years learning swordplay. He's Japanese and did not know he was in a movie. He spent two Years learning sword play.
On the other hand, it was really good and shows some depth, he did spend $10 million on a bunker that's underground to protect himself against aliens and he was able to spend $50 million on it.
I think he's a bit paranoid. Speaking of movies, did you watch Inception?
I did, was it good?
It is pretty good, the movie had over $270 million in sales, directed by Christopher Nolan, and it's directed by Chris Nolan, so it must be pretty good.
Wow, I didn't know that. I've seen the movie. It's the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio right?
Yea Leonardo is the lead actor, some famous actors rejected the part, I bet they regretted it when they saw him, I wonder which famous actors reject, he is the only leading actor
I hear of big names rejecting parts and then finding out later the movies do fantastic
Yeah I bet you're right! Smith and Brat Pitt, they both declined the role of a lousy movie.
Leonardo got the role so I guess he was ok with it. Tom Cruise has been in a wide range of movies from Top Gun to Rain Man to everything in between. He has been seen in almost every role from Topgun to Rain man to the new Tom Cruise film.
I bet it would have been a great movie, I liked Top Gun, Top Gun was a great Movie!
I liked that too, back in the day that was a good movie, I was thinking about it now. Elon Musk's wife was in Inception, that was back in 2014, and I didn't like it.
Yeah she was, that was a great movie, I think I watch that one too, it was pretty good, did you watch it?
Good afternoon!  Are you a fan of movies?
Yes I am a fan.  Tom Cruise made the first mission impossible film series in theMission Impossible film series, and I saw Mission Impossible III.
I'm not really a fan of the series, but I do like some of his early work in the movies.  I'm pretty sure those are the movies I like the best.
I think it would be nice to make that kind of money.
Yes, it's enough money to make essentially anything.  I think my favorite movie of all time is cocktail from several decades ago.  It's the first movie I ever saw that was a cocktail.  Did you have a favorite movie?
I don't care for the repetitive.  Top gun, samurai, top gun, topGun, etc.  They are all repetitive.
I didn't like the last samurai either. I heard they are making a 3rd sequel, I don't know how well it will be received, but I heard that the first one was well received.
I didn't realize Elon Musk was a Reagan admin when it first came out.  He was on inception and was the one who came up with the name.  I didn't even know he was a reagan admin.
I thought I heard about Elon Musk in Inception, I've seen that movie several times and I understand the name but don't recall what character he played, or at least thought I had heard about Musk in inception, I can't recall that either, I don't really recall whatCharacter he played.
No kidding! I have to see it again just to say that it's confusing. It's sooooo hard to follow. It took 10 years for Nolan to write it.
Talk about a passion project.  They needed multiple flow charts and someone to keep track of everything.  That's how he kept track of a passion.
Yeah.  I think in Inception was one of the first ones I saw.  Nolan said the movie had no idea what was going on.  He was wrong!  Musk's wife and his son were in the movie, so it was probably him and Nolan.
Ahha, I was racking my brain and I can't figure out that it was his wife in the movie. I did not know that. I wonder how they got that figure in the Movie?
Yes, I think the cruise is dedicated to the samurai. He spent two years learning Japanese and was able to become a samurai!
The concept of the samurai is fascinating!  The name implies that they had a purpose in life, and that if they fail to keep that purpose or fail to protect their master due to certain circumstances they can kill him.  I like that the samurai were able to protect or protect their Master due to the concept of ronin, which is a mercenary who wants to kill.  The last Samurai is a great movie!
That's kind of true for Cruise, who spent a little bit of his $100M in a bunker to protect himself from aliens.  I think it's kindof true for him.  It's a bit wacky, though, that he has a bunker and is spending $100,000 on aliens.
He's a scientologist and a popular member of a religion to boot, and a very popular member at that.
Yeah i heard about that,  wacky.  He did etch katie holmes on the top of the burj khalifa building.  I wonder what he did.
That is creepy, I got the feeling he did it in the shower after.  He has led a full life with his Katie Holmes marriage and kid.  I forgot all about her, I forgot about her.  What trivia did you know about Katie Holmes's marriage and child?
Yes, he sure has.  He had to rethink all his risky business back in the day.  I mean, he did stunts like hanging off a plane at 4,000 feet and even the newest one where he did one of his newest "stunt" of jumping off a planes plane at 10,000 Feet.
Risky Business was great. When I was younger, I was a huge Rebbeca de mornay fan.
Yeah she was hot. Thanks for the chat, you were excellent.
Hi, how are you?
I am well, thanks! Uou watch Jurassic World? I liked that movie, and Fallen Kingdom, and the new movie.
I did not see it, what about you?
I did not see it either, there was absurb scenes that didnt make sense to me,
I liked it too, I liked Chris Pratt.
It was the second one, and yeah it was the one with Pratt, and he was also the velociraptor trainer in the first movie, so he was the Velocir Raptors trainer
I had a crush on him becuase my wife likes that movie, and the trailer for the movie has him shirtless in it and I like him shirtlessness better. Have you seen it?
I thought it was a nice movie. The parts were unreal. Like when the volcano explodes and he suddenly can move around and everything.
I saw it on Netflix and it's on there, Ill check it out, I found it odd how the dinosaurs only appear on screen for about 10 minutes, I think that was because of the small CGI budget, I know that dinosaurs have been around for a while, but I also know that it has a small cgi budget
Yeah that is a cool fact and theyy used elephant roars for the t-rex, I am guessing that is an expensive production, cool fact though, the elephant roARS are like a t-Rex,
I recently heard that dinosaurs used to be small and meek roars.  I've heard that Dinosaurs used to only be projected at movies that were small and Meek.
Velociraptors were smaller than projected in movies, so that doesn't sound scarier.
It would take a whole movie to make one.  I wonder how much a amusement park ride cost for a park ride?
I didnt, I didnt know that!  I was a Dinarour fan as a kid.  I love him.
No, I am not but I think space is very intriguing to me!
I think they are interesting facts. I heard scientists recovered a sample of tissue and blood vessels from a t-rex.
Wow, I wonder if they ever tried to clone it, they would immediately regret it.
Yeah,  yeah it would definetely chage things,  and Jurassic Park should work out with a warning lol,  I wonder how Jurassic ParkShould work.
I think I'd be more into screwing it up if it semi-resembles a dinosaur. I'm not sure how one could get away with not doing it. That would be an ethical dilema for sure. A sad creature.
It would generate a lot of dispute and that is how Chris Pratt acts.
I do. He worked at Bubba Gump. Nice chatting with you.
Did you ever watch Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom?
I did not, but I heard it was better than the first one.  I did not like the first movie, though.  The first movie was about a woman who was running in high heels, but the second one was different.
I like the scense that dont make sense to me,
I don't remember talk about one.  But Chris Pratt is paralyzed, but crawls around in molten lava with a tranquilizer dart in his paralyzed limbs, and he crawls across the molten lava to get to a TV where he is given a tranquilized dart.  So he can watch TV.  I wonder why he did not get one.
Yeah that is an absurd thing.  I wonder how computer parts in the park still function.
Yes, I was also amused by Chris Pratt doing a somersault with an open mouth.  T-Rex's did it for a somerault.
That's a ridiculous scene, Chris Pratt defies physics in that one!
Yes, that is it.  Apparently he is a house builder before he became an athlete.  Seems strange for someone who was a housebuilder.
I know, it does seem strange. In the middle of the film Pratt developed nave seal skills, it was magical. Did you know in this film pratt developed naves in the middle
It's hard to believe that the reviewer of the movie managed to make dinosaurs boring.  I wonder how the movie manages to make them boring?
I didnt like the leading actor in the jurassic park movies, he had inconsistensies in them, but thats just me, I cant say that i like the other leading actor of the other ones
Apparently the dinosaurs didn't come out in the first film, which was about 10 minutes of the film.  Universal built a ride that cost $50M and took it down after.  I wonder why.  Apparently the Jurassic Park ride is the best.  Did you know that?
What did it cost? I wonder how much it actually cost?
The ride cost $50 million, the film itself $15 million.
I hear they should spend $15M on the second movie and add more dinasour time to the movie, but I joke Chris Pratt made $300M on that franchise, I think that is a joke Chris Pratt made
I think people would get bored with the dinosaur time. I think it would be interesting to have more dinosaur time and less Pratt joke.
He joked about it in the first part of the Jurassic Park.
Wow! I guess he had a premonition of the winning Power Ball and was going to make a joke about that. I wonder if people think that the computer generated "dinosaurs" in the dinosaur suits are the raptors, and the "dinocents" are just computer generated...I guess that would be a win for the computer. Oh wow! What was that about? Did he make a laugh and make a comment about the dinosaur suit or did he make one about winning Powerball?
I did not know that.  It would take a long time to render one frame on a computer.  I thought it would have been a T-rex dinasaur and not a computer, but I was fooled.
I suppose so, but I wonder what they did with all the raindrops and water dripping from T-Rex.
Yes. That detail is impressive I guess it took them so long to render.
My wife is trying to whipping cream for my chicken soup right now.  I am going to go wrap it up with some whipping cream.  It was nice chatting with you!
I wouldnt want to upset the wife with all these cool facts but I wouldnt like to say no.  I hope you have a nice meal and thanks for the chat and for all the cool facts.
Hello, do you like Jurassic World?
I have not, it has problems from talking to velociraptors to costuming to the believability, I am not really watching it now, do you like it?
Yeah it was a bit cheesy, I liked Chris Pratt, but not as much as Chris Pratt.
Yeah, he was cool in that, but it did seem a bit of a bit like that all of a sudden Navy Seal special forces transition to him.
Did you know dinosaurs only took about 20 minutes to go from 1-20 minutes?
I like predictable humans over dinos. If it turns out bad, it turns into bad.
It cost $15 million to make and only grossed $309 million.
It is not a very low price for a dinos but for deviating from CGI. I wonder if they had people inside of suits instead of dinos like they did for people inside.
CGI wow, that was definitely a rip off. Apparently Pratt joked that he didn't want to have the lead role again.
That doesn't surprise me. Bubba Gump nonetheless.  He's been in the news a long time for waiting tables.
It took 4 hours to render one frame of soaked rained T-rex.
I don't know how someone had the patience for that, but Americans think humans an dinos lived at the same time so they must have had the same patience.  I wonder if the dinos living now had thesame patience.
Wow too funny.  James gun wanted pratt for guardians so bad he had to pack his own cgi.  Did you know that James gun want a new pack of  pratt's for guardians?
Hee! That would be exercise! I wonder if Pratt made a similar deal when Spielberg casted him for ET?
Yeah I wonder that too.  I wonder if any states have dino fossil's?  Only 5 states have dinosaur fossil's.
No I did not know that. That is pretty cool though. In Canada there is a glow in the dark dino coin.
Did you know that he also had a role in Guardians before Pratt?
The guy that plays Dennis on sunny in Philly?
Yes!  I used to watch the show.  I think it was his first job.
I think he would have been really funny, I never watch the show myself.
In my opinion, he is the original.
I think the people that tried to burn the dinos were only burned for about 5 minutes, but the d dinosaurs were already burned by then.
yup, I think so too.  Well it's been nice chatting with you, have a good day!
hello! How are you?
I'm doing well, thanks. I was reading about Jurassic World and the Fallen Kingdom. Did you know Chris Pratt is in it?
I haven't seen any of them either.  I haven't stood around to see them either, what have they stood for?
I was interested in the paragraph in the movie that only talked about how scientists expressed the genes of chickens in a way where they grew teeth and I'm not sure how that's possible but scientists expressed it in a movie.
I was surprised the dinosaurs were only in the film for about 10 minutes, that's not a lot but still a lot less than the first 20 minutes of the film
I know right! It's not a big deal! They did a good job of not building suspense when they first went on the screen but still building suspense.
True, good point. I loved the Michael Crichton book and the original Jurassic Park. I went to the park in fear! I loved it!
I never saw it either.  My husband's obsession with the movies feel a bit dated now that I'm older, and it's harder to believe the movies are so much older.  The new movies feel  a bitdated.
I think post-parks and rec is better. I don't have a thing for Chris Pratt, but my wife does and he is ripped!
So true.  He was really good in Parks and Rec.  Pretty good.  I think he's good in silly movies too.  But he's usually good in stupid movies like Star Lord.  So he rocks when he's hot LOL.
Agreed. I can't imagine him wait for a few weeks to do Bubba Gump, he was in it for 6 weeks!
Haha, no way! That's hilarious! Hey honey, I'm just a waiter and that's how the heck you know they made him out to be the waiter? Haha, he's hilarious.
He is an incredible actor who made the jump to TV. He has done several roles, he is truly talented and an incredibleActor.
Yeah, he is pretty funny and sells the role.  The delivery man was a pretty funny one.  I think he has like 10 movies listed of his movies listed that are about him.
I think he is funny in the delivery man. It is a generic role. He did well in parks and rec, too.
Yeah, I just finished it. Ben was so tired when he finished it though. I felt like he just couldn't focus. He felt like his dream was crushed because he had to focus on how aggressive Leslie Knope was. Kinda weird to think of her as being kinda opposite of feminism, but she's a really aggressive Leslie knope, so she's definitely not the opposite of Feminism.
Yeah, it was a little corny.  She works in parks and rec so she was always there.  I think she is really good though.  The writing is really fast and she is very impressed with her writing.
The writing was great. Chris Pratt and April made the show. Happy dog and angry cat, happy dog and mad cat.
damnit jerry, poor guy, he did it so wrong!
Uhh Brooklyn Nine Nine was really funny, the poor guy.  I saw that one time part of the show recently.  It was the one time bit.
I missed it but I would love to see it again. I'm glad NBC picked it up, I love it, it was a very well written show, but it was cancelled before it was over.
I'm still watching it, I'm sure it continues, I just have to go episode by episode, maybe I will try watching it on Hulu episode by Episode, I don't know.
Nice chatting.  Thanks!
Hello, did you hear that clowns copyright their makeup designs on eggshells?
I heard that.  American makeup companies have resumed animal testing to try and sell products in China.  Some of them say they have to do it to sell products.  I wonder how many of the American makeup firms have resumedanimal testing.
I wonder why they would want to do animal testing related to selling products in China?
That is required to happen before China will buy it.  Did you know that Keanu gave up a $10 million matrix salary to keep the special effects and makeup staff.
I wonder why movie producers pay so much.
Not sure.  I wonder why?
The special effect staff agreed, but I was thinking at loud that maybe Keanu could give that money to charity, I wonder if the special effect Staff agreed with that.
Do you make socks? I use hand knitting and machine knitting but I like to make socks.
I did not know that.  Hard to believe that a lot of people did not have a lot to do with it.
The acoustic era gave rise to the expression that "people put a sock in the phonograph horn to mute it."  Did you know that people put a socks in a phonograph Horn to mute the horn?
lol  That is too loud for my wife or husband to see me talking that way.  I'm too loud.
lol, I just learned that Best Buy and Target will price match amazon, I wonder why?
I wonder if Best Buy does that?  I know that it is very expensive.
Yes.  I hope you like it.  Target opened their first one in Minnesota.
I wonder if I will ever catch up to amazon, do you perform on amazon?
It will be a brick and mortar sad in the long run.  Sears and a target store went out of business.  Vermont is the only state without a Target store in their malls.
I wonder if that has to do with laws prohibiting it, but I know they are trying to open up some new ones.
I doubt it.  Target has never carried any tobacco products so that's good.  Did you know that Target has not carried any Tobacco products since 1996?
I am guessing they lost a lot of money for that but it was morally good.
I'm sure. Did you know Walmart sell cigarettes?
I don't know. I have never smoked one though.
Yes, I have never advertised herbs, but I have seen some supplements though sold in Walmart, Target and GNC.  I know that Walmart and even Walgreens cannot legally advertise them as supplements though Sold in Walmart.
Did you know Michael Chiklis went bald after a mishap with theater makeup?
Hi!  I did not.  I wonder if he was mad.
Yea, Chiklis said that his makeup caused him to look different all the time and it was not his.
I couldnt tell you.  I think ancient Greeks used white lead.  Good for them.
Sounds like a bad idea, I wonder what that was like. I also wonder why clowns copyright their makeup designs on eggshells?  I wonder why?  clownsyright their makeup!
I didn't know that. I wonder if the makeup crew had to wear it if they cared about what teh other ones wear? Did you know that the matrix special effects cook Keanu Reeves gave up his salary to do teh makeup on the matrix for only 1 million. That was more than the salary of most of the special effects crew
I think Keanu is a great guy, apparently in Team America the Kim Jong-il statue is actually a person in makeup, he's apparently in team America the Korean.
How do you make it look like that? I wonder how they transform it?
Yea, it is a shame that American cosmetic companies are going back to animal testing
I thought they outlawed it a long time ago, poor animals, I thought they had outlawed it for a long, long time.
Apparently, but makeup that is sold in China, is not sold there.
I guess it is, well it doesnt make me like it,  but I guess if its made from coconut oil it isnt as bad,
Yea, maybe. I think places like Target should refuse to sell tobacco at all.  Some stores do, but not all stores.
I can't believe they banned the salvation army bell ringers.
I never knew Vermont was the only state that did that, I wonder why, I know they have their own targets, who do you think is the targets?
I dont know, I dont think it is very popular there, they must be missing out on something, Target is great, I think they trademarked the fake french name so they are probably popular there.
That is pretty funny. I wonder why it became popular. I guess price matching Amazon helps Target. I Guess price matching amazon helps Target too.
Wait, there's more?  I'll grab some of that, I'm sure they're good for $27.95?
Yea the Amazon price match is a hassle to deal with, but it is a nice perk for the Target employees, they have to price match.
Did you know that they were founded in 1994?  Same year as walmart, and founded in the US.
I had no clue! Nice chatting with you!
do you like cosmetics?  I do
Yes I do. How about you?
Great! How are you? I saw the Kim Jong-il statue in Team America, the first person dressed up in makeup to be a Kim Jong -Il statue in team America, did you see that?
I thought he was, I wonder what he looks like?
Did you know Chiklis went bald? It was likely due to a bad makeup disaster.
I hear that, did not know that about him.
Did you know clowns copyright their makeup designs on eggshells?
Interesting.  Did you know that Keanu reeves gave all his $800k matrix salary to special effects and makeup staff, and then later gave $32 million of his Matrix salary tospecial effects staff?
Wow, that is a lot of money!  Good for him, he must be doing good for that!
It is so nice of him to treat those people in need so nice.
Yes it was. Do you like to wear socks?
A few times. Do you?
Socks is a really needed item for a homeless shelter, its the most needed item in there
No, I was not aware of that.  I wonder why?
Do you ever go to Target by the way?
I do! I shop there at least once a month. How about you?
Cool.  Best Buy and Target will price match amazon now.
That is the reason I do so much shopping there.
Do you know Vermont is the only state that has only 1 Target store?
I thought that was surprising.
I thought that too.  It was good talking to you, have a good day!
Did you know that Spider man first appeared in comics back in 1939
Spiderman is one of my favorite heroes.  I have never seen it though.
Mine too, and he does deal with real life struggles, financial issues and all. I think it helps him deal withreal life struggles too.
Yeah, and even one of the poorest super heroes in the marvel universe is one of our smartest and the smartest!
The green goblin had money, but he was short of money because he had so many enemies. The green goblin was always short of Money. he was rich when he was with green goblin.
Yeah, that's a curious fact. His enemies had tons of cash I guess, that makes spiderman special, that is why he makes spider man special and not others, but yeah, his enemies had lots of cash, curious fact
Stan Lee created it to be special for a reason.  He did not want to be confused with Superman, so he kept the hyphen in so that he would not be confused.  I wonder if that is why Stan Lee created the first name hyphen so that it wouldn't get confused with superman.
Thats funny lol. I wonder if the original version of his appearance was in the comic book amazing fantasy, the original one is worth thousands of dollars and is in comic book Amazing Fantasy 4, it has his appearance in it and is worth $500,000
Imagine if he battled spiderman at one point?  I heard that the comic had Cap'n Crunch arch rivals and that's how he battled him at one points.  The comic hadCap'n crunch's arch rivals at onepoint.
I think so lol, Sony bough it in 1998 for $25 million I bet Spiderman whipped the floor with them, and now Sony bought the rest for $50 million I Bet they regret not buying the rest
I thought the world would never care about spiderman, but I was wrong. Spiderman is great.
Marvel Studios and the movies has shown that the Marvel Universe has great heroes
Spiderman has great video games too not to mention the video games on the Playstation.
Yeah I like to play video games a lot, a lot of them are really good, I like play station 3's but I always like to purchase the latest game for my play station, do you play video game?
I do play some.  I have a playstation 3.  It's used to study black holes.
I did hear about that, I wonder what the results are, I know that it is cheaper to gather play station 3s than to arm a supercomputer with one, do you hear about it?
Apparently, the army is using xbox 360 controllers to fly UAV spy planes, not the powerful computers.
I have not had one in a long time. I bought an Xbox One when I was on standby and it made a creepy sound when it went off.
That is weird! Xbox and the PS2 are both great game consoles. I honestly think that the PS4 and PS3 are more powerful than the XBox. The playstation is just more powerful.
I think I would rather have the Xbox one.  The only thing I like about it is the exclusive to one brand and a certain brand of some games.
They are all fans of each other.  On Xbox a guy spent 20 dollars on a carnival game to win a 4-player game toWin $300.
Hello, do you have an Xbox or Playstation?
I personally like the Xbox. I think it's crazy how far we come since launch day, I was on the Playstation 4 way back in 2003 lol!
I love Xbox, it's so great. I loved the old Playstation, the red ringed one, not the red one. I still love Xbox.
I was never red ringed so no problem with the Xbox. I was in hurry. I can't believe that the Xbox One sold over 100 million units. Crazy that it is still around.
WOW!  I missed the warranty.  I got one free for a week, but I think I will get another one if I missed it.
That's annoying! Apparently it was released in the US back in 2003 but not in other markets until it was first released in 2004 for Xbox 360.
Yep, I have an PS4, but I'm back at Playstation 3 now.  Did you know that the army uses Xbox controllers to fly UAV spy planes?  I wonder why?
I bet they save a lot of money using xbox controllers, it's crazy that quadriplegics have special rights to play xbox games, they can play custom games on it, I bet they're save a lots of money too.
That is awesome to have that ability. LOL. Have you heard ofikerowesoft.com?
Haha, no I have not. I remember when it was strange when it starts to make weird noises on the dashboard. It didn't take long to get used to it though, so I'll leave the original Xbox alone, even though it starts and starts to made strange noises when I leave the Original Xbox on, I don't remember that one haha
I remember those too, they were scary, I have an XBox and games on the court,  but not the Xbox one I remember that one lol a kid made that website and sold the domain name for $1, smart kid lol,  smart kid  lol
Haha, that is crazy.  I wonder how much the United States government put into that supercomputer lol.  They built a supercomputer in the 60's and the United states government put $1B into it.  That is crazy!  I wish they would have built a PlayStation 4 or something like that,  that would have been a great supercomputer LOL
I do have a PlayStation 4 and I like it, its awesome that they did that, Netflix has the game "Tony Hawk" by netflix now that's awesome
Yeah playstation 3 is my favorite. Speaking of playstation, apparently it's so powerful you can research black holes on it. It's being used to research black hole's!
Wow, that's awesome! I never knew that. Did you ever play grand theft auto on playstation?
No I didn't play that game, I never played it, I put the original one on when I first got the PlayStation but never played that one. I did listen to the soundtrack to it though apparently it's awesome, I should listen to it on my PlayStation 3, I'll have to put theOriginal one on there, I wonder if it's still awesome
I remember playing the first one and it was awesome! The overhead view kind of stinks, the 2 version was amazing, but the 1st one I remember playing was the only one I could see.
Yep I agree with you. I played the video game on the Sega Dreamcast and it wasn't the same. Also weird that stay the same hyphen in spider-man is so that it would not be confused with Superman. I know Spider-man isn't a video game but it's weird that it is, I wonder if that is just a typo or if it means Spider-Man? It seems like a typo haha.
That's funny, I never knew that lol, I loved Spider-man for Playstation, that makes sense. Nice chatting with you, I think it was funny.
Stanley used to be the voice of Madame Web in the Spider-man series back in the 60s, his wife was the voice, that's cool.
Wow, that is awesome! Enjoy your night!
Hi, do you play video games?
Hello, I do like playing video games, I have an Xbox One, but I like PS4 more, do you?
I have played xbox, whhich one do you prefer?
I honestly like the PS more. I don't remember much about Xbox. I think I had the PS2 back when it was the first system, but I don really remember much of the old system.
Ive heard good things about XBox games, Ive heard bad things about Xbox games, too. Microsoft got some things wrong.  I played games on it as a kid, but never became interested in it or played games for it.
I like Call of Duty games and Madden Football games. I think it's cool that they are using controllers for quadriplegics for Xbox.
I never played Madden, but Madden is fun! I played madden a few years ago. I did not know that they did controllers for quadriplegics, I wonder why theydo not have controllers forquadripleGics.
That is so crazy, I don't mind using my xbox 360 controllers to fly UAV spy planes, but I don' t think the army uses the controllers toFly UAV Spy planes!
I wonder how they learn to use those controllers, the UAV spy plane was only designed to last for 5 minutes, so that is great they would be able to learn how to use the controllers,
It's probably easy enough.  I wonder if any superhero characters like Spider-man have one?
I do like Spider-man, I think he is one of the best heroes. Spidey is a really interesting one.
I do like him, I think its funny why spider-man has a hyphen in his name, it's the only way to do so
I thought so too!  I never thought of that!
Stan Lee didn't want them to confuse him with Superman, so he did not use Superman, I guess that's smart.
Yeah, they are similar enough that the spellings are quite similar.  Superman is a marvel and spidey is marvel.  I think that is why Spidey was always known as superman.
SONY paid $130,000 for the rights to Spider-man.
They got paid a lot for a character that was never very valuable to them, but they got paid for him.  He is still a very valuable character though.
I wonder how much money they would have brought in if Sony didn't take the money. I wonder how many games they would of brought in for the Playstation 2.
Yeah, I think Sony is all about the platforms so that would make sense. Anyway, great chat!
Great chat!  Have a good one!  I wonder if they have Playstations?  They are even used by the department of Defense!
Have a great weekend!  Thanks!
You too!  Have a great one!
Have you seen the movie Jurassic World?
I have not, but did you know that the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park only apperad for about 10 minutes and were helo by the helo.  The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park onlyapperad to about 20 minutes.
Wow!  That's pretty short.  I didn't even think of the dinosaurs in that movie.  What were they in?  Did they do anything with them?
Haha I think so too. I wonder how much the Jurassic Park ride cost to go through in the movie, the Jurassic park ride cost $300
That is insane, I heard it was cost like $60 million, that's a ton of money, I wonder why it cost that much, that is insane.
Yeah pretty insane. Do you know who generated the raptors from the movie?
Yeah that was pretty cool. I wonder if it is more animated nowadays, people can actually get in suits and act out the suits and acts.
Yeah, it is. They make one frame for t-rex that only took two hours and it took them 4 hours just to make one. I wonder how they got them all out of the rain all soaked.
Yeah it sure was a long time I guess. The raptors could have opted for the suits but they opted for nothing instead, that would have taken a longtime too
Yeah good point. Did you know that chriss pratt joked about not being the lead in that one?
Haha smart guy, I guess. It worked pretty well for him. Have you seen Jumanji?
Yes, I did. It was a beast and I liked it a lot. The boy from Jumanji, the one who does the voice of chip from Beauty & the Beast, is also the voice for the boy who does chip from JUmanji.
Wow nice!  I did not know that.  3rd Rock had a budget of $15 million and only made $309.  I can't believe it had a budgets of $309 million!
Yeah he made a ton of money. It had a $15 million in the opening weekend and $270 million by the second one
Yeah he did and then went on to make over 8.5 billion worldwide
Wow that is a ton o fmoney. Yeah. He is also the voice of slick in the Jumanji cartoon.
Yeah, I've read that it was Tim Curry, pretty cool.
Yeah. Do you know much about physics?
Some stuff like kim jung has a degree in it, but I don't know much about the rest
Wow I guess he is smart, he violated the universe's laws of physics laws if he thinks that existed and did that, he must be really smart, or maybe he violated all the physics laws of the universe, I don't know
It is cool that that can happen, I wonder why it did not happen.
Hello there, do you like the Jurassic Park movies?
I have, I like them, are they good?
Yeah, I've seen all the movies. The last one I saw was the dinosaurs that are only about 10 minutes long but I really like dinosaurs.
Interesting the velociraptors are only waist high and in the seat of the adult. I think I was glued to the seat in the movies as an adult, they were in all the movies.
Yeah, they are not that big. I wonder how big the other raptors in the movie were?
No not really. I know that originally Jurassic World was going to be about human like raptor hybrids. That would be really interesting!
I meant it would be animated so it could be people inside suits?
Oh that makes sense.  That is cool.
Yeah, I've ridden the whole Jurassic Park ride. Have you ever ridden it?
I have a few times.  I love it.  But those jerks are just too much jerks.  My gosh,  that ride.  lol  I can't believe how many spins there are in it.
Nice, apparently it cost $60 million to build, that's a lot of money, and apparently it's cost $75 million tobuild again.
I was reading about Jumanji and thinking about the mummy ride at Universal last night and the line to get on the mummy's ride at Jurassic Park ride couldn't hold more than 10 minutes because the jurassic park ride could not hold 1 second of wait for the line!
I have not seen either movie.  I was surprised to learn how much it cost to build it.
I was also surprised to know that Jonathan Hyde is from Australia, I wonder if he was in Jumanji, I know he was from Australia.
Yes, I have. The movie made so much money, over 1.5 billion workdwide!
Wow, that is alot,  thats a good chunk,  $500 million was when 3rd rock came out,  that is a good chunks of it,
That is amazing! He is a beast! He was also the voice of chip from beauty and the beast, and the voice for the voice from Jumanji.
I did not know that.  I loved that movie.  Who is chip?  I wonder if he did that voice.  lol
Yeah me too. What other topics do you have? Do you have any interest in science or other topics?
I do.  Its interesting that the Hubble telescope found a galaxy so vast that it might not even exist.  I wonder why they found it.  They found a universe so vast it may not actually exist.
That is cool!  Did you know that Kim jong-un has a degree in physics?
I thought I had heard that. Good chat!
Have a good one!  Thanks!
Hi, how are you?
Fine, how are you?
I am fine too. Thank you.
Do you like watching movies?
I sure do. I like sci fi, action, mystery,comedy, etc.
The Fallen Kingdom, The Incredibles, Jurassic World.
I have not, have you?
It is actually the third installment in the Jurassic Park film series. It is pretty good, but not as good as the first Jurassic park film.
I have not seen all of them, but I saw the first one and thought it was ok.
That is a classic, it is incredible how they were able to create the T-Rex roar.  Elephants roar as the primary sound and it is what was used to create to createthe t-rex roar!
I had heard that, but I don't think I have seen it, but they did such a good job!
Did you know that all the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park actually lived during thecretaceous period?  I wonder what the title of the title means?
I didnt know that! i wonder why I didnt know?
I guess Jurassic Park sounded jazzier than Crusty Cradle of the Park, LOL. I guess Jurassic park sounded jazzIER than Cradle, lol.
I agree,  that dose not flow well for sure.
I suppose creative license to make it sound better to your ear.  I didn't realize that the velociraptors are about waist high and can be seen by an adult human.  But, I suppose creative License to make them look like velocviraptors is okay if you realize they are only waist high to an adult.
I read that somewhere.  I did not know that.
I would like to try the dino sized meals from McDonald's.  Do you know how many dinosized meals from mcdonald's are?
I have not been to McDonald's in years but I will probably go there once in awhile just to grab a big mac.
I try to avoid the fast food route.
I prefer real meat, I eat meat only when it's necessary.
lol, well it was lovely having this talk with you friend.  I am going to go wash my cat, now.  It has been nice chatting with you this fine Florida afternoon.  Talk to you soon friend,  it is time to go and wash my cats up.  Lol
Hello, have you heard of the Razzie Awards? They award the worst movies of the year, I wonder who gets to award the Worst movies
Yes, I am aware of the Razzies. I am shocked that so many people think they are the RZZs! I would be shocked if they won!
I was surprised to hear that, but Mark Wahlberg got a double nomination too, I wonder why
Well, he was great in the departed and horrible in the one that is happening right now.  I think good and bad performances are always going to be good and good performances.
I agree, he was good in Daddy's Home 2 and Transformers. I liked those movies, I liked him in transformers, did you see that one?
I was surprised that those two madea movies were both nominated. I don't think I've ever seen either. I'm surprised any of the nominated ones.
That is a surprise to me, I didn't know it looked like a cheesy horror film, it looks like a snowman.
It was awful! You mentioned transformers, the film had like 50 explosions per minute! That is like 4 explosions per second!
Wow, that is a lot of explosions. I guess people liked it because the movies ended up grossing over 1 billion.
That is surprising when age of extinction has a 93% rotten tomatoes score.
That is terrible scoring. I think it is like a cat with a terrible score, it lives for 10-15 years, but then dies 10 times in the same years. optimus prime has died 8 times.
Wow that is excessive. I wonder how many more he will go through?
It does.  Michael Bay got a human flicked in the film for the megatron.  It was Michael Bay.
Yes I did notice that. It's so complicated to be in that movie that I did not notice. Apparently the cgi took 3 hours to render every last frame of movement in that one movie, it took them hours and hours torender.
I loved Jurassic Park.  I was hesitant when they announced Jurassic World, but I know it is going to work.  Do you like action movies like Jurassic World?
I do like Jurassic World and the sequel Fallen Kingdom, I have not seen the sequel
Yeah I liked the first one, I'm glad it worked well, but I'm not sure about Fallen Kingdom. Chris Pratt is one of my favorite actors, he joked about not doing a second Jurassic Park, I think he would have done better with Fallen Kingdom though, Chris Pratt's one of his favorite actors
That's funny! The ride cost $20 million to make and the movie cost $15 million to made.
Wow, that is hard to believe, the ride only takes about 10 minutes surprisingly, it was fun. I wonder if they will do a film about the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, I have seen a few, but the ride is so much fun! Well, it's been nice talking with you today. Have fun!
No idea, I wonder if they had a big impact on it. It was nice talking with you too.
Same here, dinosaurs were so good.  I'm going to go watch some more tv now.  Have a good one.
Hey did you ever watch the tv show transformers?
Yes, I did!  I liked the original show, but not the new one.  Did you?
I used to watch the cartoon and the movies, but I don't watch them now. Do you watch the show at all?
I like the first movie too, the second movie released by Bay.  I have not seen the first one yet though.  Have you?
Good point, I liked the original animated movie, the rest were horrible LOL, and the rest weren't that horrible lol.
Yeah I think the first one is really good, the second one is totally not so good.
I agree with you. The director of the movie The Rock, Michael Bay, directed the movie but it wasn't very good, he is also the director of The Rock.
Yeah I liked The Rock, great movie. Just kidding about the Rock, I haven't seen it.
lol  I'm glad they did not use it in the transformers movie.  There were like 5 explosions per minute apparently in the first transformersMovie.  That is about 5 explosions every minute apparently.
Yeah, I didn't see it to be honest. I liked the original cartoon transformers better though.
It is not a cartoon... live action movies are very complicated and it takes more than 4 hours to render a new frame.  It does not impress me that in the cartoon it took 24 hours.  The live action ones only take 2 hours and only take like 2.5 hours to rendering.
True, but I think that's an exaggeration.
True, I think so too.  I haven't seen it yet.  On a different movies note, did you know that jurassic world fallen kingdom was actually horrible?  I thought it was ok but I thought the first one was horrible.
No, it was. Word.
It's only 10 minutes but it has dinosaurs and the original Jurassic Park in it.
Yeah, I thought it was good but I didn't like Goldblum as much as I thought.
Yes, but there is only a couple scenes in the movie that he is in. Honestly not worth seeing, just a couple Scenes, it's honestly not worth it
I think it's a little too much for me to be honest. He's great as an actor though.
I agree with you.  Chris Pratt was the lead in Jurassic Park four back in the 80s.  I guess he joked with Steven Spielberg that he was the next Chris Pratt, lol.  He was the Lead in Jurassic park four, I guess
OMG! I can't believe it.
lol well I trust you, but I guess counts as a remake, if I am missing a few, that I guess count as a new one lol! I don't trust the UK remake
I love Halloween,  Ive always liked costumes and I love Halloween.
I like halloween too!
No, not really.  I did wear a panda costume for work the other year.  Panda researchers wear a Panda costume forwork.
that makes sense. they wear it during mating season, that is scary. it is mating season!
That would be scary indeed lol. Do you like Johnny Depp?
He spends a ton of money on wine every month, $12,000,000.
That is a lot of money! I like how he dresses up in his Jack Sparrows costumes and visits sick kids at hospitals, that is admirable, he dresses in his costumes and visiting kids is a great way to use his money.
That is cute.  I think its great for the kids,  he is a character that is scary but also cute,  for theKids,  and scary
He probably would at that point.  I know Sean Bean from Lord of the Rinds did it for kids.  He wasn't scary at all.  But, he is a little scared of heights, like Sean Bean.
I read that.  I think flying would be a waste of time for him.  He could be sedate with a read.  Have you ever hiked?  I have but it seems like such a waste.  How about you?
lol that is a fun approach,  I like the gucci brand,  what do you think of the guatelli brand?
I do like them, I think they have status or prestige items but I have not tried any of the status or Prestige items so I may change my mind
I do not know any interesting facts, just that the brand is ok.
I do not, what are they?
Rick harrison actually dropped out of school to sell fake gucci bags, he earned $700 per week from them, he must have earned it
Wow, Rick Harrison got a lot of money for fake bags?
He's a businessman, a personality who also watched pawn stars and a personality that has become a businessman
I have seen Chumly get busted for drugs. Do you like Rick Harrison?
I don't know lol  The founder of Gucci was called Guccio Gucci,  not Chumly lol
Chumly was weird, but he was unique.  He was on for about 10 episodes.
Yes I did see that show. The show had the Italian pronunciation and Gucci was founded in a pawn shop. I wonder if the history and facts you discovered were from the history of the Italian Pawn shop.
What do you think about the Razzie Awards? It's an interesting award show, I think it's an very interesting awardShow.
No, I haven't. I heard about it recently, though. I think it's a funny concept. They poke fun at some of Hollywood's worst productions. I feel bad for the nominees because I know they can't do anything about it. I wonder how many of the 22 nominees have been in movies recently.
No I have not seen them, but I read that they are horrible movies.
I have seen a movie called Disaster Artist with Tommy Wiseau in it, it was terrible and got a razzie award.  I have seen Room, my favorite movie ever, it is a cult movie but made in the 80s, I heard it got a cult award but was terrible, it got the Razzie Award!
I have not seen that movie. I have seen Killer Tomatoes though, it is an awful movie, my all time favorite was Attack of the mummy, another awful movie.
I heard it was about the mummy but I haven't seen it.  Attack of the Killer Tomatoes?  What was it about?  I didn't see it.
It is about literally giant tomatoes invading Earth.  It is horribly, horribly bad.  I think it got a few razzie awards and the movie got one called Mother.
Yeah, it stars Jennifer Lawrence, that's hilarious. I think Razzie put that in the worst actresses category because it's a category for the worst, but yeah, it's one of those madea movies! It has Tyler Perry and also stars Jennifer, which is hilarious.
That's funny they would consider that one of the worst actresses, I wonder why. She did get a nomination for best actress though for Walberg.
Yeah, she deserves a razzie for sure! The hilariously bad movie is called Rubbermaid, I heard about it, it was awful, it's a horror movie, but it was so hilariouslyBad, it deserves a Razzie.
Rubber is a ghastly movie! I've seen the movie the snowman but I don't like that movie.
Rubber is a killer tire. I've seen the snowman and the killer tire in my life.
I think it was the screenplay that was shot and released in 2011, but there is a lot of missing footage. I think 10-15 percent is the missing footage, maybe more.
That's crazy! I wonder why they didn't have time to shoot it! Tomas Alfredson has been in so many decent movies though.
It is by him. adam sandler was nominated for best actress and actor for the film.
That's funny. Jack and Jill was the best one.
Jack and Jill? Jack and Jill, I believe. They played opposite sex fraternal twins.
That is funny! I guess that was good for Adam Sandler.
He wasn't. I like Tyler Perry in that film. Apparently he was nominated for best actress for that film a bunch of times. I don't know why though.
I feel like an actress should be an actor if she is the best actress, not a transphobic one.  It was for a female character.
Yeah that is a bit odd.
Do you wear a costume for Halloween?
I dress up in costumes for Halloween sometimes, my mom and dad like to dress me up, how about you?
lol I don't, but I remember seeing pictures of them in ridiculous costumes.  I wonder if they ever did that to the panda researcher who was a panda?  I remember see pictures of those ridiculous costumes!
A panda researcher? I wonder what the attractions and benefits of that career are. What would it be like?
I think it is because you get to wear panda costumes while working there, so you get used to it!
That is pretty cool. i guess you don't have to worry about being uncool. that panda costume might be a bit hot, but I would make sure to be cool. that Panda costume would not be uncool at all!
True lol. It is cool, that's the thing about the hospitals though, they are so cool. Johnny Depp dresses as Jack Sparrow and goes to cheer up sick kids. I wonder if that's true lol, he does that to cheer people up, but I don't know if I would do the same thing. I don'
I think he is such a great guy and he is really for the youngsters. I know he has been known to help kids, and stars who are popular with the kids.
Do you know that the pirates in the Caribbean like to dress in Gucci clothing, they were actually pirates in 1975
That would be cool, but I can't afford the gucci. I can afford the Gucci I have right now.
I do not. I have fake Gucci belts. I do not know if the difference is the same as real.  I wonder how people tell the difference between the two?
i wouldnt know the difference. I do not like fashion. I would like to learn more about it. i am not fashionable. do you like fashion?
lol  The creator of Gucci was named Guccio Gucci.
Gucci O'Gucci, silly sounding, sounds irish, I wonder what he was going for, but sounds Irish to me.
It sounds more Italian, lol!  Sounds like a name that a guy started out selling fake Gucci.  I bet he would make good money in that business for only a dollar a week!  I wonder how much money he could get for selling fake GUcci, I bet it was less than 1 dollar a day.
It sounds like a fake Gucci o'gucci,  but if you are going to give up all of your online chatting for cash,  you might as well try fake Guigi O'Gucci.
Rick Harrison from Pawn Stars has a successful business. That's a good start for getting started lol,  he got it started lol
A pawn broker can get things pretty much anything done.  He can price fake goods.  That is a good tip.
Good point, nice business plan. Nice chatting with you!
Nice chatting with you as well!  Perfect plan and a perfect plan that will never fail!
Have a good night!  Thanks!
Do you watch the transformers?
I do, I like cartoons, do you?
Nice! I like the original ones as well, they were great, I heard the rest of them are not as great
I heard that, did you see the movie Bumblebee? I think it was good, but I haven't seen it yet, have you?
Oh yeah, I haven't seen it either. I know the first movie was a low $309 rating but there were a series of movies that made billions with a rating of 100%
yup I saw that one, it's crazy! There are like 300 explosions per minute in that movie, that's insane, that must be like 50 explosions per second, yup that is crazy!
I know right! And optimus prime dies like 5 times in the first 100 years, that's like 10 times more than the first 10 years,
That is a lot haha. I wonder if that includes all of the movies, cartoons, comics, and comics that he's been in, that includes the ones that kept bringing him back. I think it's amazing that he has done so well, I wonder why they keep bringing him in.
That is a lot.  I wonder why, maybe because one of the guys is indestructible?
Yes, I remember the part where Megatron flicks a person in the transformers movie, I think it was the transformERS movie
Yeah I heard that one. I like Michael Bay in it.
Yup thats true, the comp took 2.5 hours to just render one frame of the movie because the movie only takes 1 second to render on a comp
Yeah that is insane. Did you ever see Jurassic World?
I do like it, sad that the dinos only show up for about 15 mins total, the whole movie
I wonder how much it cost to create Jurassic Park?
Yes there was a jurassic park ride that cost $50 million
Yeah that is crazy considering the movie only cost $15 million, that is so crazy that the movie Only cost $309 million!
That's a bargain, it's funny the raptors are not really scary, but the actors in suits are, I think it's a movie for the actors, not for the movie itself, they are all scary
Yeah, Chris Pratt joked that he would be lead for the next 100 years!
Haha, that is funny. I did not know that, I did know that the trex in the movie took 4 hours to render one frame of the movie, that's not very fast, but a lot faster than how it took them 3 hours to rendered the first trex which is funny
I bet so. Nice chat.
Rihanna was stunning at the Met Gala, she definetely catched a lot of glances, did you see it?
I know, her outfits were all over the glory and now awards.
I am a Rihanna fan, I love her outfit, it really made me love her.
I don't know about you but I'm really not a fan. I'm not feeling it, but I do like Kim.
Yeah, I'm not too sure either. I do like Katy Perry but I'm sure she's going to have wings soon.
I thought she was super creative and it was a lot of work to get dressed up, but I liked the behind the scenes pics of how she dressed it up.
I thought the wings that they gaved the gala was a nice touch.  I remembered them from when she was little.  It was nice to see them remembered again.
I like the red carpet, but not the awards. I think it's a show, not a show. LOL
I haven't either. I will definetely have to watch it though. I'm going to friends, I know it's upcoming, and I'm not going to be able to watch the ones that are upcoming.
That sounds like fun, I think I will do the same thing.  It will make a night of it!
Yeah I'm sure some surprises will bring this years awards out, they give out so many!
I'm not sure.  Probably Nikki Minaj.  She's up for best of time, lol.
I think that would be crazy, she definetely knows how to spend her money and be weird lol, that gala was going to be crazy! What clothes did she spend so much money on?
Gucci Gucci!  I can believe it.
Yeah, crazy that the Gucci article is worth $100k, crazy.
Catholicism and fashion are two themes that come together often
I have no idea!  It's crazy how Rick Harrison dropped out of high school and went on to become a millionare of the Gucci.
I would never sign up for that lol.  I get $40k a week from fake Gucci bags!
$2,000 a week?  That would be nice!
Me too lol. I met one at Halloween once for $15 lol.
Definitely.  I know it's crazy but there is definetely a different competition there.
It has become a competition, not a fashion contest.
Do you like fashion brands?
I am not a fashion misfit. How about you?
Me too. I try to follow them but do not buy their expensive clothes
Gucci is the Italian brand?
Yeah, it was founded in 1886.
I think it was founded back in 1886 if I'm remembering correctly, it was in Florence, Italy, I bet they make a lot of money there, I'm not sure how much but I bet it's a lot, I'll bet they made a lot more than we do.
Yeah, they do, they have like 2 billion Euros!
I bet that they are kind of in the top 3 brands for US income, but not sure who the top three brands are in the income.
I think so. Do you like Rick harison?
I do not, I know that he was a gucci.
Yes he made a living selling fake Gucci bags. Sweek. He made a Living selling fake gucci bags
I know too bad, but he started his career by selling toilet paper for the Gucci brand.  I wonder if he ever tried selling them to the first woman to run a major motion picture stuudio, she started out as the firstWoman to run the Guigi brand.
Wow, that is amazing.  I wonder if she is the founder or something?
I know it was Guccio Gucci. I think it's great that you can still buy it. If you like ecclesiastical clothing you can call it "gooch" clothing which I don't buy.
I like the designer. He is the director. Tom is his last name.
nope, I didn't.  Hugh Jackman walked out of a comic con wearing his wolverine costume from the gucci.
Yeah I wonder too. Do you listen to music?
I listen to a lot of older stuff, mostly Katy Perry, but also newer artists and a lot to newer artists. You?
A mix of ebverything. Katy Perry has received 22 grammy nominations and has not won one, but has had 3 grammy nominated.
My daughter told me that she has tied michael jackson's record of most billboard #1s from a single album (14), songs with best Billboard #1 singles for a single Album (3), my daughter told i.
Yeah, she is pretty popular. nice chat!
Hello, did you play with legos growing up?
I did play with legos but not my favorite ones, what about you?
I like them too.  I think it's cool that if all the lego bricks produced were shared out equally every single person on earth would have enough.
Wow. 86 bricks per person. That is a lot of plastic. It would be a lot for the environment to handle.
It is, I am wondering if they will do anything about the plastic usage, seems like a lot of back lash,
I'm not sure, but it's one thing to have a lot of contamination but not enough for the environment to be a thing, I've heard Lego is investing millions to make sure that the pieces are safe and that there's a lot to be done.
That is a great idea to ditch their oil-based plastics in search of environmentally friendly alternatives. I wonder why they don't do that.
I think it is a great idea, making their product safer for the environment.  Did you hear about the German graffiti artist that painted a bridge with the legos, made by legos?  Made them safer by making theirProduct safer.
I can't believe that. I wonder what it looks like. I know it attracts a lot of tourists. I would never picture that.
Yes, I think so.  The city didnt erase his work of art.
I had no idea that they replaced Ferrari as brand finance world's most powerful brand, I wonder why?
wow that is a huge step, I think, and they got their employees back, they got a 18 karat gold lego!
That must have been a really expensive lego.
That is expensive I agree, did you watch the Lego Batman movie?
I did not. I saw the first one.
I watched it, I really liked batman, he is a great hero, he was my favorite hero, Dark Knight is my other favorite hero
There is a batman villain named condiment king, do you know his name?
I didnt know that,  what do they do with his powers lol
I'm not sure, but he is defeated by slipping on too much ketchup.
Sounds like something Adam West would do. I wonder if his Kryptonite was his powers? I know he had kryptonite that was one of his powers.
I do, I think it's funny that he has a logo of his name on his molar, I wonder if that is where he got the name?
Yeah I am a big fan lol.
That is some commitment. Too bad some of these people don't know that.
Yeah, I think he was in a tough spot when it came to having it hidden.
I don't understand how Netflix has 150 movies that have a "Rotten Tomato rating" of 100% or above. I never bothered to watch many of them. I don't even understand how netflix has so many.
I have.  I think I have a 100% score for Michael Bay.. but my husband will agree that anything subjective is crazy.  lol
Haha.  I remember when the brand finances world was a little different for the kids.  They were more into legos and Spy.  Now the kids like Ferrari and Spy have replaced Legos.  It's hilarious the rating rating is taking away an audience who are more powerful than the target audience.  The feeling is the same, but the rating has been replaced with a feeling of being replaced by companies trying to get in the audience's world. haha
Yes, they can target children of all ages and companies can also target children and adults. Some brands are just smart, like the golden ferrari that reused the same people and reconstructed them in golden shapes, but that worked out for them. Did you hear that legos are so smart, people reuse the bricks and then reuse them in different shapes and sizes and then rebuild them again? The man who built the ferrARI is a genius, but he reused the bricks to create a whole new car that is now known as the golden Ferrari, that's smart!
No I didn't hear about that, but that's cool. That is crazy that they still care enough about people to do that. Lego is dope and I think it's cool that people have invested so much time into the company, I mean they have a living room with Lego floors on it and a Lego store in one of their movies. I think that the Batman and Batman Arkham movies are really cool, but the amusement parts are so rotten. Damn, those movies are rotten.
That's crazy to think that Rotten Tomatoes is only available for certain movies. It's crazy that most large companies or websites started by undergrad college kids.  Spykids, the movie about the almighty batman, was a movie about some undergrad high school kids.
That makes sense though, I know from a young age I was like you. I would think that the rating would have been higher if it was a Abraham Lincoln movie, but it was an Abraham Lincoln movies so it makes sense that it was allowed to have a rating.  I think that internet has become the place for opinion on many subjects, especially on subjects like "democracy" and what is allowed on the internet.
Speaking of Batman, he is my favorite superhero.  He appeared in the Detective Comics and had all the power powers.  What's great about Batman is that his brute strength and genius intellect are not seen in other superhero comics.  Wonder how he got those powers.
I've been a long time fan of Batman as well.  Marvel has created tons of new superheroes in the same universe as Aquaman, but in order to make a movie about the DC universe, they created tons new ones.  One thing I didn't like about the first lease movie was Spiderman because it had a connection with Lego and Batman.  Lego has a connection to Spiderman from the movie, but Marvel didn't want to make it a connection in order as to make the movie.
It's a convoluted, if not a little convoluted, universe as Marvel has been working on for a while now. Batman is the same universe as DC. DC did create a new type of "Hilarious Villain" called Condiment King. It's a hilarious villain that is defeated by slipping on a can of ketchup. I wonder if Batman has ever seen that. I know DC comics create a different type of villain every now and then.
True, Marvel is owned by Disney so their stuff is just weird.  I feel like DC should stick to their own stuff and build their own team, but yeah, it's funny that DC is ownedBy Disney, but that is also true.  It's kind of a bad thing because I think DC comics are so strong, and I feel that Marvel is just too creative and has the best team.  That's hilarious though, I think the movie was kind of strong, but I think it was just a really bad movie.
I'm a millennial I remember growing up in the afternoons after school and the morning on saturdays, the cartoons, cartoons were the way to market.  Even though I'm not a kid, back when I was a millennial i remember growingup there was a rating on Rotten Tomatoes of 100% on Batman and he was the only batman.  I think it was Adam West, right?
I know right, thats dedication to Adam West! Youre the worst. I am wasting my time, check rotten tomatoes, I like youre right. I like Ben Affleck, he is annoying though, he bugs Bunny, bugs Bunny! He also bugs my children's bunnies.
Yes, that was a weird strike. I refuse to watch it. I hear ben affleck has an intelligent argument. I think he is a great Bruce Wayne, but I do not think he's Batman. He has done some good, but as with Christian Bale I thought he was better. I like Joaquin Phoenix, but he was not Batman.
hahaha, I totally understand. I love Tom Hardy too, I think he's great in it. The plot is not great but it has a good rotten tomatoes rating, it's got a 93% rotten tomatoes rated, but that's about it tbh. I remember Bain was great as a lego batman, but I'm asian so I can totally understand him, and I remember Bane.
Are you aware that Weird Al Yankovic did some voiceover work for the recent animated Batman vs Robin?
I did not know that. I think he started out as a voice actor for the factual sectional, and then became famous as a narrator for a factual sectionals, and vice versa.
I'm not sure, but it wouldn't surprise me if it happened that way, I think his songs were just better than his voice so it happened to him.
Haha. Wow. It surely is animated. I think Batman and the Lego Batman are reaching out more than Lego. I can't believe the plastic crime crime surely has not been around that late, it's getting late!
That is a great strategy for Lego to remain relevant and reduce their impact on the earth, plastic is all the rage these days lol, I think it is a good thing they are trying to do away with plastic, I wonder how much plastic they use, it is all a great Strategy for Lego's to remain relevance and reduceTheir impact on this earth
I think they are trying to save the planet, but I think they need to go further.
I love reading rotten tomatoes.  Do you like Michael Bay movies?
I think tust rotten tomatoes is the best way to give accurate reviews specially with netflix movies,  they give accurate Reviews specially with Netflix movies.
I doubt it.  It's surprising that they are owned by Warner Bros.  They've had movies with poor reviews, but then again, Warner Bros has been known to have movies with bad reviews before.
I didnt know that, I guess its unbiased, I wonder why a lot of those that use the service, I didnt know they had a news service too, I would guess its biased
I guess they want to control what people see.  I wonder if the movie was any good enough to give it a higher rating?  Mortal Kombat was pretty good and the video game based on it had a higherRating than the movie.  Guess that's why it was a better video game.
I used to love to play Mortal Kombat games.  I guess some people dont like the franchise, I guess they are not a Batman fan.  Are you a Batman fans?
I like the voice work in Batman vs Robin. Weird how the voice of Batman does so much voice work.
No I didnt know that, thats an amazing aspect of batman, he doesnt have superpowers that is an amazing fact,
Well, the bad guys are getting smarter and more smarter, so it wouldn't hurt to have them. Plus he is rich so he has the money to develop all kinds of technology.
Yeah, I agree.  I also like powers and Alfred, he is a badass!
Robin is underrated, I think Robin lego sets are the best ever, Robin is only like $50 and he has over 750
Are you a lego fan?
I love lego. I want to get a set of all of the 750 million are defective piece but the odds of that are slim of getting a set are 1 in 3 million are defects in the set.
Crazy odds! I would file a complaint if I saw one, right? It's great how lego is ditching oil based plastics and seeking out environemental friendly options.
I didn't complain but it was the first time it happened to me. I'm glad they were switching the plastic finally, it seemed like it did not fit with todays use, I still have my parents old lego pieces, I'm sure I'll complain if it happens again, but I'm just glad they are switching to a different plastic, it seems like that is the right way and it does fit with the plastic's use now
I like Legos, too. Did you hear about the German graffitti artist that made a bridge out of Legos?
I have seen pictures of it, it is massive, like 2,000 square meters and it looks like it is so neat to look at, but you can't really see it from pictures, it's so massive!
Yeah, it was painted in the 70s and was great and I think they didn't leave much out of the artwork, I think most of it was paint and painted over.
That's a shame.  I know what you are talking about now. Did you ever play a star wars lego game?
I havent played that game, but I want to buy the new Lego Batman game, I need to buy it, I havent seen the old lego batman game
I will play that one, bye!
Have a nice day! Bye!
Rotten Tomatoes is a good site for reviews.  I think its a good website for reviews
I think it is a good site, but I tend to shy away from the reviews. Netflix has almost 150 movies with over 100 percent rating, and Netflix has over 150 movies that have a 100 percent Rating
I wonder what movie has a 100 percent rating, I wonder if that is because that company is owned by Warner Bros or if the rating is just because the company is own by Warner Bros
I think there are so many ratings, it's hard to give any movie a 100 percent review.  LOL  Spykids received a 100%.  I think that is the best review in the world.  It was perfect for me.  Hard to give it a 100% because I have no one to give a 100 Percent review to.
I thought Spykids was a great movie, but I think 93 seems really excesive lol,
I know, right. I wonder if they achieved higher in the video game. I think they got a rating in the game, but I'm not sure.
Did you ever play as a child with the legos?
I did.  I was the first person on earth and the first children to play with legos.  It is a rite of passage for most children toplay with lego bricks that are divided into different sizes.
86 bricks per person no kidding!  That's a good thing the company is replacing their oil-based plastics with a friendlier alternative that is better for the environment.  They're searching for an alternative to the oil- based plastics and are searching for a better way to help the environment
ya I agree, that is a lot of plastic, in July of 2018 they produced 1.25 billion lego parts, that's a lot!
That is a lot of plastic! it has a big impact on the environment, did you hear about the graffiti artist that actually painted a lego bridge? he painted it with a lot Of plastic, that's a really big impact
I did not, but I'm told that is why Lego replaced Ferrari as the worlds most powerful brand.
I guess every kid wants to play with legos. I guess Batman was their favorite hero.
I like him too!  Hard to believe that he originally appeared in a comic book in 1939!
Yeah, the Dark knight was a comic book.  The story was about a hero without powers.  Comics are a great way to tell a story.
I wonder where Batman Gotham City is located in the canon? It is in New Jersey and the Batman Gotham city is located there?
That is funny.  I think he was defeated by a villain named Condiment King.  He was worth a lot of money then lol.  But he was the one who took the manor and the villainous villain named condiment king from him,  so he must be worth a bunch of money now that he has defeated him.
I know! lol! He let it slip by me by any chance. I think it was ketchup or something.
Yeah, he defeated him!  lol
Funny stuff. Adam west got the batman logo on one of his molars. I wonder if it was for the batmen logo or the bat?
I didnt know that, I bet the Joker laughed at that, Adam West was the condiment king, I wonder if he was the Condiment King, I Bet the Joker Laughed
Hey, did you know that woman have the rights to vote?
I have not seen the movie. Have you?
No I haven't but I've always wanted to support movies with female superhero leads. I'm not a big fan of superhero movies in general but I wanted to Support movies with male superhero leads too.
Yeah, that is a good idea. I figure that women heroes have to have their own battles and that's why the scenes get dull. the explosions and the battle are not visible, the battle is not as visible. i dont watch those movies. i figure thatWomen heroes would be better.
I watched it once and the compulsory heteroromantic subplot felt so unoriginal.
It's showbusiness.  The producers want to make money off the plot lines and get the most safe bets.  Younger audiences are more open to new plot lines.  They are the producers.  If it doesn't make money, they don't do it.
Yeah, honestly. I hear that the new Captain Marvel is going to be a love story, that makes me want to see it, honestly, but I don't think it will go over so well. It's not like they have Captain Marvel.
Yeah I think that's what I prefer, I like simple love stories more in super hero films, not so much in the new ones.
Robert Downey Jr, denzel washington, and older superheroes have all had grey in their hair.
Yeah, there is so much variety in the genre and the stories and stars in it have the potential to appeal to wide audiences with so much diversity and variety.
I think I am tired of Leo DiCaprio.  I am not sure what movie he's producing next.  Twilight Zone movie?  I don't know if I want to see it.
He is a gifted actor, I enjoy his work immensely.
Yes, I'm glad he finally won an Oscar. I feel like it was his first major award but then again it was a Golden Globe. I'm just glad he's finally won one.
Yes, he has been overlooked for so long.  He has gotten a cold shoulder from Hollywood.  Too political, too big, too political, and overlooked.
Yeah that is true!  I think they're still hanging onto Marlon Brando's Oscar award as well.  Apparently he didn't surrender it after being blacklisted by the us govt.  He was given a Picasso painting as a reward for his services to the govt, which was apparently a surrender of a Picassos painting.  lol
That's odd, I know some people end up on the black list, Richard Gere is also on the list, but how many people end on that list?
I wonder if it happened because of the hamster thing, or the Buddhist thing.
yeah he was a big TV news personality back then and made a comment about Tibet and the dalai lama or something.
Forget and forget is a way of saying, but I vaguely recall something recently happening, but can't recall exactly what.
I dont remember that, but I think it was after. Hollywood likes to stick to the political line and stars do not like that. Anyway, great chat! Stick to thePolitical line and Stars!
Yeah. I guess there's pressure to be progressive. I am not a liberal but I am a progressive. nice chat.
Hello there, do you enjoy watching movies?
I do like watching movies! I saw a woman recently who was a serious movie about a woman.
I loved it! Gadot is a real fighter, a real Fighter for the Israeli defense forces. I am looking forward to the sequel!
Yeah, she did a good job with acting. She auditioned for catwoman and did really well. I thought she did really good. She was auditioning for catman and she did well. It was a completely different role than a soldier. It's funny that she did such a goodJob!
hahah go figure, I wonder if she got the role, she was the first woman to do so, and the character first appeared in 1939 when it was just a woman, hahah go figure
No, I don't. I don's make it to movies very often. Did you know that the Wonder Woman movie is apparently the highest grossing movie of the 2nd world war.
Well it was made in 1941 and was made by the secretary, so yeah that is a cliche, but yeah it is one of the highest grossing movies.
Yep that's true. Yeah, the secretary would never fly today haha. I also don't like Leonardo DiCaprio making so much since he's been making so many. I think he was the best in Titanic, but I don't think he would do Titanic again.
He is a good actor. He is apparently producing a twilight zone movie.
Interesting, I wonder if that movie is good. I think Leonardo DiCaprio is in a new movie too, sitcom growing pains. Apparently Brad Pitt Matthew Perry is also in it, I think the movie is about sitcom Growing Pains.
I have not.  They did some great work together.  It won one Golden Globe, but I don't think they have won one in their life.
Yeah that is crazy, he is a good actor in my opinion, he did a remake of the movie the revenant once, he was really good in that movie the Revenant in my view, but yeah, he has never been a really good actor.
Yeah I saw the movie Man in the Wilderness and it was a remake of a movie, I liked it a lot but I didn't know that about the remake.
Yep it was really good, I heard about it, and I also heard that it was an interesting movie the basketball diaries, it helped launch his career apparently, interesting movie,
I did not know it was Denzel Washington. I'll have to check it out.
Yeah I think he's a pretty good guy. He played this actor who likes grapes, grapes were the fruit that were used in the loom commercials lol and not just any fruit but the grapes that were played in the Loom commercials.
Oh wow I didn't know that.  I haven't seen those either.  Did you know the movies had a sequel?  I wonder if there will be a sequel to the sequel?
Interesting. He seems to be very talented though and his family is also talented as well as his son plays for the St. Louis Rams.
Niceee!  A guy refused to pay $5,000 to get a star on the Hollywood walk of fame.  That guy refused, because he did not want to be associated with the Walk of Fame.
That is pretty funny, I guess he did it in principle and not for money, I can support that, that is principle for sure, I think its principle and he did that for the money,
Honestly I don't know. They all made great careers out of that stand up and star in their own way. It was nice chatting with you.
Did you know that there is a National Book Festival for the Library of Congress?  I didn't know that. I didn' t know that a woman could own comic books.
I didn't know that, I do know Brad Meltzer is a great author, his work is called history decoded, his first work was the Congress National Book Festival, he is a history decoder.
The first book I ever did reading was Body of Lying by David ignatius, there was a movie made out of it, but I never saw it.
No I never did, I like that movie a lot, I think it was directed by Ridley Scott, do you like the movie Wonder Woman, that was directed BY RIDLEY SCOTT? I like Leonardo DiCaprio in that movie, I also like the first movie a a lot
I did, it was a great movie. Wonder Woman is the best actress and I like how they used stunt doubles for the graphics, it is a great Movie
I don't think she did any stunts. That wouldn't surprise me.  I think she was in it because of the Israeli army, but I don't know.
Cooler. I heard when she auditioned she thought she was going to be cat woman, not cat woman.
Wonder Woman is the highest grossing superhero movie and the second highest grosses World War Z. It's crazy how it rolls around in different rolls. It is amazing it is the third highest grossed superhero movie but still.
Wonder woman started out as a lowly secretary to the justice society, a group that is now the justice system.
Wow that would not fly today. Back then that would have been way back in 1941. Times have changed.
A secretary would probably not be able to use a normal typewriter.  Her fingers fit in the amazon one better than a normal one.  Wonder if she could make her fingers fit on the Amazon one the woman used for the normal typewritten.
That is a great question! There's not a lot of female lead movies in the year 2018. It's interesting that one of the top three highest grossing movies of the year, was a female lead movie.
That's interesting.  I wonder what a mortal kombat character would be like.  A woman with a bunch of powers would have to fight off a bunch to be the mortal kaiden.  The Mortal Kombat character has a bunch  of powers.
It is really crazy how far it has departed since then.  Speaking of actors and actresses, one of my favorite movies of the 70s is Leonardo DiCaprio's "The Last Samurai"  Did you know that hes already departed?
Yeah, Leo is great! Did you hear about the sitcom called Growing Pains that he did? Did you catch that? It was about eating Gilbert Grape?
I liked the sitcom back in the day, I didn't know he was in that one.  Did you like any of his movies, like the movie Blood diamond?  I haven't seen that one, but I liked the movie "The Last Tycoon"  I liked that one too.
I didn't know that! I did catch the 80's movie Training Day but it wasn't very good. I didn't think it was that good. Did you know Leo or Denzel Washington have won more awards than you?
I bet that Denzel actually won more awards, I guess. It's funny that he used to play the character grapes in fruit loom commercials. I guess he did the Loom commercials too, I bet that's why he got so many.
That was a good move for Denzel, I guess. Cute fruit and a cute fruit. I guess that's why he started in the school play as a kid, which is surprising. Gotta start out small.
Lol, talk about a talented family!  Impressive that Denzels son actually plays for the St Louis Rams.  Talk about a very talented family.
Yes, they are talented, too bad Denzel isn't a football playing son, Snoop Dogg is a star, he got a Hollywood Walk of Fame, but I don't think he will ever pay for that. He would probably rather have a star football player instead of a star star.
What do you think about the latest wonder woman? I haven't seen the movie. Have you?
No I haven't seen it.  I have heard Wonder Woman is the first of the DCEU movies released.
I heard it was good, but I guess it was directed by a woman named Patty Jenkins who was actually in a screen play by Allan Heinberg who was also good
Yea it's interesting Wonder Woman is set during WWI, most movies avoid that time period
True, I guess Gal Gadot is from before the war having served in IDF, it makes sense she would be able to know that.  She did a great job for someone who was only 5 years old in the war.
Yea, she did. It's interesting that it's the highest grossing WWI movie in box office history and the first one with a woman.
Wonder woman first appeared in the beginning of the 1940s in America. I did not know that.
Wonder woman also appeared as a member of justice society in the 1960s
Leonardo DiCaprio has some sitcom growing pains.  He did not start out well with his start.
Yea, Leo is a great actor, I knew his film debut was with those critters when I saw him in The Critter.
I didn't know that either. He should work on a Twilight Zone movie. He was actually producing a Twilight zone movie.
That sounds like a Twlight Zone movie. That would be pretty scary. It would probably be good if Leo didn't appear in it. That could be good.
I think Leo would do a great job in it. I liked the movie The Revenant too, a film of wilderness survival.
I did, The revenant was pretty good, I'm glad Leo won an oscar for it, did you?
I think it's funny, that Denzel Washington is in all of those movies.  I wonder if there is a sequel to it?  He has a sequel for "The Last Tycoon".  Do you like Denzel washington?
Yea Denzel is an amazing actor and a fruit, its funny he was in the loom commercials and also the Fruit of the Loom commercials, he is an awesome actor
Yeah, and he's also got a switch to do the circle he did on the spinning, switch to the spinning. I heard that he did a graphic for the library of congress' national book festival. I guess it was to celebrate books. Do you like books?
I haven't but I know Brad Meltzer wrote "The Inner Circle" and I think he is also in "The Switch"
There's a movie about him, I think it is at a festival.  He is a bone collector, a bone Collector, and has all kinds of books including fantasy.  Sounds interesting.
Yea, the book "A Body of Lies" which is another book turned movie, I heard they covered the book in the movie.
I heard that too.  Thanks for the chat!
good morning!  Have you heard of Stan Lee?  He was in all the marvel movies and he always cameos in the cameos.
Yes, i love all of his films. he is a good writer.
I agree, he was such a good writer.  I liked Winter Soldier, he speaks so well.  And Captain America, he is a good Writer.
I wonder why he doesn't?
He did Iron Man appearances, Larry King, Tony Stark, and Hugh Hefner were my favorites.  I think Larry King was just having fun doing it!  Hugh Hevner was not one of my favorites
That is cool!    I remember him and spiderman getting married!
I do know some of the movies.  I don't think he got married but I do know he got Married in the first one.
I don't remember if he did, it was a public thing but I think the original Spiderman got married to Mary Jane, I think.
I was a fan of Spider man back in the day so that was good. I don't know the difference between the movies though. I do like Peter Parker in the first one marrying in both movies. The difference is that the first movie only had a Stan Lee cameo. The second one had a Peter Parker/Stan Lee cameo
It is so cool, Spiderman made Stan Lee $700 million in revenue!
That seems unfair! He created something important! The military even used him to achieve spider man like abilities. I think the military needs to achieve Spider man's like abilities!
I have a hard time with that. I like Thor, did you ever watch him?
No, I haven't seen Thor, but I was impressed with the cast of it. I really like Anthony Hopkins, and I think the whole cast is better than Thor itself.
I didn't watch it long enough for me to really like Thor, I guess I didn't like it as much as Loki or even Tom Hiddleston, I like Loki better though.
I heard that he put on 50 pounds of muscle for it!
I cant imagine working that hard for a role that small. I will have to watch Ironman 3 to try that out. How bout you?
I watched all Iron Man movies, I thought Robert Downy Jr did an outstanding job, I also thought Robert did an excellent job
I thought that too.  Genyth Paltrow was amazing in the role too. She was so skinny and so small for the role.  I think she got the apple for being so skinny.
I don't think I ever notice, but it's a really good one. She was really good. She's intelligent and builds a really cool hero. I remember she was in the Iron Man story. I think it was the Iron man story, right? The super rich guy who is so intelligent he can remember all the things he did before he became a hero. He's a super rich dude, and very intelligent and build to be one.
Iron man came out like 30 years ago, so that means that iron man is from the 60s or 70s, right?
I know.  I saw it a few months ago and I sort of hate him.  Jeff Bridges is the bad guy and I don't even know who the bad guys are.
Stan Lee passed away and it was sad.  I feel like he was in so many Marvel movies and had cameos in many!
I have a feeling that they wont and that we wont see any more "funny" ones,  Winter Soldier was one of my favorites of them.
That was my all-time favorite too. He did an amazing Spider-man appearance. I like the one when he was wearing the headphones, and then explodes when he is wearing them.
That is a good one.  I would like to drink a cup of the hulks blood, how much is that in it?
I think that was the most memorable sound of them all, that is the visceral memory, he tastes the kick and then makes it into a bottle, and then the brand is in the bottle, he never knew he did that but it set off a visceral memory in me, it makes me think of the brand and that brand.
Robert Downey Jr is a great actor my other favorite hero is Iron Man I loved him in that one, Robert Downey, Jr is another great actor, and your favorite hero?
Yes, the iron man movies really launched the Marvel cinematic universe. One of my personal favorite films is Thor, which I still see it on TV today.
Yes he's a great character. Did you know that most of the dialogue in Thor ragnarok was improvised?
That's incredible. I completely love him and would have to know that! I just learned that Tom Hiddleston is going to play Thor, but I think I also know that Chris Hemsworth plays Loki, which is incredible! Loki was originally going to be turned down to play thor, but Chris Hemworth really nailed the character.
Tom Hiddleston really nailed the Loki character.  Loki stole the movie with his protagonism.
That is true, I mean the team of characters were never meant to be just the support characters in the comics, they are meant to also be the team, like the support team of Thor by Kenneth Branagh in the DC comics
Yeah.  I think that's why they were pulling new actors off the roll in the bad Spider-Man movies.  They didn't have continuity and they didn't want the continuity to go down.
Marvel has a lot wrapped up in the Spider-Man character now, so I'm surprised their movies don't have a lot of the younger audience.  I think it's a place for them, but they have Marvel as their flagship.
The US military is also using soldiers who can emulate spidermans abilities.
No I didn't that is crazy, sounds like a marvel gimmick honestly! I like how they created a "stunt wedding" with actors that were actually married to the character that they created. Sounds like a stunt wedding with actors.
I didnt hear about that stunt, sounds like it would be dangerous and a bit of a bit much, it sounds really difficult to alter humans to have the same or similar abilities as Spiderman, it would have to be really difficult, I mean he has similar abilities to them, so it sounds like a lot of different ways to alter him, also sounds reallyicult to alter human beings,
In the real world he had Stan Lee officiate.  He pretended to marry Peter Parker, but it was Mary Jane.  Then he pretended to marrying Peter Parker again in the real World.
Interesting, yeah I can see his point, he sells movies that way and creates interest in them.
I think that the fact that they are so well-known and considered a comic legend just shows how effective it is.  I mean when Iron Man was released and first published in 1938, it got so many spots.  It was so well known that people were still going to see it when Iron man was released in 1941.
I can't imagine him not living long after his death, the Marvel franchise is live on even after hisdeath, can't even imagine it not being around.
He gave it a boost to start off with.
Do you like superhero movies?
I watch super hero movies all the time.
Nice. Did you ever see spider-man?
I have seen them all. Stan Lee made a cameo in the first spider-man movie.  He saved a little girl when a building exploded.
Nice!  Did you know that the military can't replicate the abilities of Spiderman?
I never knew that, I wonder if they are trying to get soldiers bitten by radioactive spiders to give them super abilities.
I guess we will have to wait until the plan for this develops, I guess.
I think I will watch the Thor movies. I haven't watched any of them yet.
I have not but I have seen Antman made the debut in Thor 1.
Wow! I never knew that Antman was a part of the Thor movie. I remember that Iildris Elba played him in the Thor: The Gods and the Norse Gods. I also remember that Idris Elka was in a bunch of white supremacists and supremacists in that Thor movie, I think that was part of it.
Yeah apparently antman is in the superhero movies like spider-man, hulk and iron-man. I like other movies like Spider-Man
I wonder who did Antman play in the Ironman movie that Jeff Bridges did, I never saw it.
I was not paying attention but that's right. I think he played in that one. Did you know that Tom HIlleston originally auditioned for the role of Thor and was not even given the role? Instead, he got Loki, which is why Loki is in it. I wonder why.
I knew he was good in the Avengers movie, but I never knew that about the Thor part... amazing!  I recall he was really good in The Odin Ravens.  In the Thor movie, when Thor and Loki were arguing on the mountain top, Odin ravens flew down from the mountain.  The ravens were from the Avengers 2 movie.
Yeah, he had to gain about 50 pounds of muscle to make him look set for the role of Thor. You need to gain 50 pounds to make yourself look right for the movie, that is a lot of muscle.
I can't recall if I've ever seen it, but I do know that Stan Lee made a cameo in Thor. He was at a party at a dark world. I think it was in Thor: A Dark World.
He is a legend, man, the man who has done so much with so many characters and gotten so much profits off of the characters
Yeah, he died recently at the age of 85. He did lots of tours across the country, comic conventions, and did lots and lots of TV.
Yeah, he had a great career. He performed the opening of spider-man back in the 60s and 70s, too.
No, I do not. I think it was a bit before my time. I know James Cameron was supposed to do Spider-Man in the mid 80's. James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Leonardo DiCaprio were going to do it. But the studio cancelled the film before it was made because of Arnold Schwarzenegger. I wonder why? It was the mid 90's.
The lead guitarist of Aerosmith was the singer was joe perry and the lead guitarist was joed perry. Nice chatting with you!
Hello! How are you?
Hello, I am good! How are you? Have you ever heard of the movie Spider Man? I have not but I heard that the movie made over 300 million dollars, that's almost as much as the first Spiderman movie did.
I like spider man, but I do not really like the x-men.
I like Spider man too, but I think the X-men are better, kind of realistic. Did you know that the military is attempting to copy some of the abilities of the Xmen?
That is weird and I wonder where they draw the line between the red and blue suit and the seals? I don't like the red suit at all.
I'd wear an iron man suit.  There is an exoskeleton they use that is called one.  Do you know what it is?
I would too! Did you know one of the characters has a telekinetic powers?
That would be great, Thor's hammer would be good for the gauntlet, it is one of his best weapons and a great way to use it.
Captain America's power is I'm assuming but bad for him with his ripped body and super strength.
Oh nice.  I know the guy that played Loki in Thor didn't gain that many pounds of muscle.  In real life I guess people have to gain up to 180 pounds of Muscle.
I think it was a slight one, but it was the only one in the movie.  I think he did weigh more than he did in the movies.
I agree, he was very thin and not that big in comparison to the movie he was in, Thor was really big. I guess maybe Chris Hemsworth was too big for Thor, but I don't agree with him, I guess Maybe Chris Hemmworth was too thin for the movie too
Stan Lee was one of the characters that had the best net profits based on the net profits, he died a rich man!
Those movies are hugely popular, and I imagine that many other actors work in them too.  I mean, I saw Anthony Hopkins acting in Thor and I didn't even know he was in it.  But these movies are huge popular, so I can see how the actors work with it.
I know!  Did you know an octopus swapped consciousness with spiderman?
I never knew that, I wonder how that happened to spiderman
It was weird, it was a superior Spider Man series though, it is the superior Spider man series,
It is weird. Stan Lee didn't mind having the bad guy be the bad man. I think that was because Spider Man was the best. When he got old he and the writers left it to Stan Lee to do cameo roles. He did not want to be associated with movies where the bad guys did not have any cameo roles so he did not mind.
He did have fun in his movies, he would put himself in everything he could and have fun with it!
One of my favorites is the fedex guy delivering a package for tony stank in iron man, that worked well for him.  I wonder if he did that for the fed Exposy guy delivering the package for Tony stank
Nice chatting with you! have a good one.
Are you a fan of Harry Potter?
Not really, I am aware of it but not of Rowling, the author, are you?
Nice, I did not know that. Stephen Fry read all the Harry Potter audio books from different editions.
I have never listened to any of those books.  It's hard to believe that J.K. J. Rowling was turned down by so many publishers.
It is incredible.  The entire series takes place in the 1960's and Harry Potter was born on July 16, 1946, which means that the entire series was born when Harry Potter is actually born, which is on July 26, 1946.
I was surprised to hear that, too.   I'm surprised to see that it was the most banned book of the 21st century.  It was the only one.
Wow, I didn't know that.  I did know that all the harry potter books were translated from British to American English.
The books have sold over 8.5 million copies worldwide, they are very popular, the books have sales of over 750 million copies
That is incredible. I like the Harry Potter movies as well. I think Robin Williams, Chris Columbus, and Robin Williams have all been great actors, but I think I would have wanted one of the British and Irish actors to play Hagrid in the Harry potter movies, if not both. I wonder if Chris Columbus was going to play hagrid?
I heard that, which is pretty surprising.  Almost as surprising as Rowling being the first billionaire to fall off the Forbes billionaire list.  Although, I don't know if that was through charitable giving, which she does.  She is the first Forbes billionaire to falls off the list.
Wow.  That sounds right.  Kudos to her.  Rowling was asked if she'd ever read a book written by a woman.  She said she'd read only the initials of a woman's first full name and not her full name.  It's absurd that the publishers were worried that boys would read abook written by someone with the first name of a man.  Sounds like the publishers are still worried that men will read novels with initials of women's names.  I wonder why?  Kidding!
That is absurd, but I feel like its universal, there is an attraction to the name, I feel that JK Rowling was just asked to use it a bit too, she was not going to change anything incorrect so she used it, I think she was right, the attraction is just there, and if you asked her to change it she would not, I don't think she would change anything, but it does seem absurd.
Interesting, I've never been there.  Are you afraid of any snakes?  I'm not afraid of them. lol
no, they are creepy, I guess I don't like snakes, I need to move to new Zealand, they do not have snakes at all in New Zealand, I will move there if I can
I'm joining you on this odd fact! Did you know that crocodiles, snakes and lizards are all more closely related to birds than they are to snakes? I think it's a crocodile that is the more closely Related to birds!
Did you know that google bought youtube for $1.65 billion in 2006?
Interesting! There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey. Yikes! They can launch at up to 20mph.
I hope that does not live on.  I think it is funny that most snakes are actually lizards and not snakes, that is funny to think about.
lol I will pass...    It was fun chatting!
Nice chatting with you too!
Have a great night!  I will, have a great one!
Did you know Johnny Depp directed the 2007 film Brave?
He was in that movie, I remember him in it.  I didn't realize he did it. Multi-talented people.  He was in Edward Scissorhands too, I think it was Edward Scissors, but I don't remember his last words.
Yeah, that was a good movie. I think he spoke in that film, but not too much.
I guess that shows how well he did acting. Gene Wilder refused to watch the movie because he did not want to be disappointed in his acting. He would not watch the remake of willy wonka.
Interesting.  Do you know of any walmarts in NYC?
That's surprising.  I think its probably due to the population.  But I am surprised by the politics of the space.  Probably due to their space.
I'm not sure.  Do you like unions?
I thought it was just because of politicians.  Chicago's nickname was actually based off of a windy city, I thought it might be based off a wind, but I don't know...
I'm surprised that there are politicans in Kentucky that have to swear an oath that they have never participated in a duel before, I wonder if they have to?
I think that originated decades ago during the middle ages when Venice was successful. I guess it's relevant now, but I thought their politicians were chosen by lottery. I think it's from the middle Ages when Venice had their politicians chosen bylot.
In Japan, if you turn 100, they send you a silver cup. I wonder if it sends you well, if it is a silver one?
I wonder how people live so long.  Nowadays, I think it would be too expensive.  I wonder if cheaper cups are a venture to be able to venture out and get nowadays, since people liveSo long.
lol. Apparently the same position does not exist in Australia's constitution.
That's very strange.  I guess it's a custom there.  They are owned by England and are owned since 1801.  Strange.
Yeah, apparently that is where the custom comes from.
Good for them.  I wonder if they have a sense of humor.  A radio station pretended to be Canadian PM Jean Chretien and pranked the Queen of England.  The radio station was actually Canadian PM Jeannie Chreti and pranks the Queen!
That's hilarious, she must have a good liking for it!
I guess so.  Did you know that the actress Helena Bonham Carter (who is in the Harry Potter movies) is the great-grandfather of the actress WOri and her great-great-grandmother was also a WWI veteran?
Interesting. I wonder how she got into it.
I did not. I would like to watch a movie about Dr. Seuss that Johnny Depp is producing, starring him, maybe one day.
Yeah.  I read Dr. Seuss when I was younger.  Do you like Dr. Sesame Street?
He is a good enough actor to possibly get more awards than he did in Roll, he did not have the awards, but he is a very good enough Actor to possibly do so.
Hello, how are you today?
I'm good, what about you?  Are you good?  What do you think about countries having prime ministers?  I don't know much about other countries having Prime Ministers.
Good, I am good as well.  What do you think?
I agree, the president has too much power!
I don't like the government title of Chief Mouser, a cat has the government's title of President, but not the President.  He is a cat.
lol that is quite a bit too much to give title to one of your pets, I would think a bit more than that.
I agree lol!  But, that is the custom, not a position of Australia.  Their constitution is different from ours.  I think it is in their constitution or something, not their custom.
That's scary! The custom is a little scary, isn't it? I wonder how much longer the Prime Minister serves as long as it is the custom. Maybe in Canada, with a queen, they have a PM that serves as a custom, but in a time the public could decide who they want to be Prime Minister.
That's scary.  At least in Japan when they turn 100 they get a silver cup to celebrate.  I wonder who sends them a silvercup?
I wonder how many people turn 100 in Japan. That's a lot of people.
Well apparently they have to start making cheaper silver cups lol,  they have been making cheapersilver cups since 1853
Hahaha. Hey, I'll have to check it out. I wonder how people voted in the last election? I voted for our leader in this year's flash election. It's not like we have a democracy here where it's obvious who the leader is. I'm not sure how old he is, but in Bulgaria their monarch died at the age of 92 and his son died before he could end it. I think that's one of the reasons we need to start looking forward to the age when people will be able to check out and vote for their own leaders. Ha! Ha! I think one of my reasons is because in Bulgaria it's an obvious way to end a dynasty. Hahaha!
I like how politicians in Kentucky must swear an oath that they have never participated in a duel before taking office.  lol  Did you know that politicians in Louisville must swear that they never have participated in an duel before Taking office?
I think in this day and age that is too much.
I guess so lol. Do you like Johnny Depp?
I sure do, but on the flip side, he is very strange.  He will visit kids in children hospitals, dressed in character, dressed up in his jack sparrow costume, and visit kids, nice.  Do you like Jack Sparrow?
I do think he is strange, but he is a good actor.  He directed The Brave.
I remember that movie, was it any good? I don't remember it.
It was. Johnny Depp only had like 50 words in Edward Scissorhands, I think.
Did you know he is related to Queen Elizabeth II?
I did!  Great talking with you!
Barnaby Joyce is the deputy prime minister of Australia and was the deputy Prime Minister of Australia from 1997 to 2007.
I heard that.  I have been to Australia, but I do not know much about Barnaby Joyce.
Yes, in fact he has been featured in a few articles regarding scandals and the fact that he is the VP.
He is the lowest key prime minister. I guess many politicians have been in unflattering circumstances.
I agree, politicians can be worse, even Bob Hawke, but the affairs of the politicians are usually not that much better.
I wonder if he was as flamboyant as Johnny Depp?  I don't like his pirate movies, but I do like pirate movies.
Yep you're right.  I think Ben Clifly would fall into that category too.
I heard that the prime minister of Australia has a cat that lives in the Prime Minister residence with chief mouser as his title.  I wonder what the cat's last name is.  It's not as interesting as the cat that lived in the UK's prime minister's residence withchief mousing.
How does one attain a title that easily?
Same here!  In Japan, when you turn one hundred years old, the prime minister of the us sends you a silver cup that says "you are prime minister"  and sends you one every hundred years!
I wonder if they get silver cups for everything! In my opinion, prime ministers are superior to presidents. I think prime ministers is superior to Presidents.
Politicians are so strange.  New York city has actually outlawed walmarts for a while, because of politicians.
Trump does not do a good job governing America, and he tried to split up Simpleoil, his company, but they are too big and he did not want to split them up, so they became the new company. I think Trump is not doing a good doing good job, he is trying to split Up Simple Oil
I do not think so, I heard he made more jobs and housing, but I heard that on social media. I heardHe made more Jobs.
Speaking of politicians, Venice was successful due to a government shutdown.  In my opinion, our governing system is at fault for the government shutdown, but Venice wassuccessful due to the government.
No I didn't but I heard in Kentucky the politicians must swear by oath that they will never duel each other, I wonder how that would work.
I heard that President James Buchanan and his boyfriend was referred to as "the other half" I heard that president's boyfriend was also known as "President James Buchanan".
That is amazing! I also heard that the Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chretien successfully successfully prank called Queen Elizabeth II by doing a prank on a radio station and called her "Queen Elizabeth II" that's amazing!
That is a pretty good prank!  I think that was brave.  Johnny Depp directed the 1998 film "Brave". I enjoyed that film and always wanted to point that out.  I really enjoyed that movie.  Just wanted topoint out that Johnny Depps directed it.
Johnny Depp has been in a lot of movies. I liked him in Arnie. The actor turned politician was an actor turned businessman.
It's fascinating. I find him to be fascinating. Johnny Depp only said 196 words in Edward Scissorhands.
That's pretty cool, and I can't remember the name of that movie. I can only remember one. I think I like the upcoming Dr. Seuss movie that they are making, I can not wait to see it.
Hi there, do you follow politics?
Not as much as I used to, but I know a little about the government.  The Prime Minister is the head of the state and executive branch of the government, and is the president of the US.
I live in the UK and there's a Prime Minister in the country where I live.
Yes, and we have a council of ministers who take advice from the PM and plan the schemes and the welfare of the nation and people from the council of Ministers to the PM who helps plan the scheme and take advice.
That is interesting.  Do you know who the Prime Minister of the country is?
I live in the UK, our country has Prime Minister, I think.
I do not know if you mean the president or the president of the country.
I do not know of a country that has a president. Who is the president?
I don't know much about your president, I read about politics and the country a lot.
The president has executive power in day to day life. He creates welfare schemes for the nation and people. He has the power to create or take away from the power of the nation's and people's. He also creates welfare plots.
The president has a good plan for the country, it sounds like it is great, he has a plan for all the people and the government has aGood plan for a great, new President, he sounds like he is doing what he wants for the people of the country
He is taking any decision he surely has meetings with experts, and the opposition party leader to get their opinions.
Yes, politics is different.  The parties talk and sometimes argue a lot, but they agree a lot.  I think that the country's government agree.  It seems like the country is doing well when both parties talk.
I think it is the president's duty to explain the current situation and the steps taken by the opposition party members, but also the President's duty for his/her own party to explain to the opposition Party members.
The name of the country president sounds like a strong leader, a lot of arguing in politics and the country's president sounds to be a strongleader.
There is, but the President does seem to have the ability to govern and the people are confident in his ability to do so.  So, I think people are confidence in his welfare and the welfare of the nation as a whole.
He is a good man, the president sounds like an inspiring politician to many people, a good and inspiring politician.
It seems that in democratic countries, politicians seek the positions of the government through elections. In other countries, it is the other way around.
Yes, democratic elections give the people a chance to choose who they want to be leading them.  I live in a democratic country.  So democratic electionsgive the people the opportunity to choose what they want for their country.
Yes, I seek their vote so that the people enjoy real power by casting their vote.  Politicians can canvas the people for the government so that they can seek theirvote.
Glad to hear you live in a country that has a good president.  We need good government and we are voting for politicians.  I am sure that we will have a good government with a good President.  Its been good talking to you.
Mission impossible 2 was a great movie
Me too.  I really liked friends and the fallout.
I thought it was really good, Tom Cruise is a great actor, he really makes the franchise come to life, he is a GREAT actor.
Yes he does! He spent two years learning swordplay and Japanese in order to do the role of a samurai.
Yes, I thought that was a great movie. I guess when he earns that much money, he can keep his roles in movies real. He has enough money now.
I think he does, but I think he uses the term " samurai" for his roles to mean more than a character or a plural reference to a clan or even a character name, like "samurai" is a term used for any character in a character's name or even just a plural term.
Yeah that makes sense, have you heard of that $200 million bunker?
I did, it was bought to protect him from aliens.
Yeah, alien proof.  And expensive.  That is very expensive.
I wonder if the fact that Seinfeld has a higher net worth than him means he has more money, or the fact he has a much higher networth
I wonder if Tom Cruise will eventually get on top of that. Seinfeld was a success but I think Tom Cruise have a lot more movies planned for the future so he may be in a lot of movies.
I think Tom Cruise is the fourth generation to do so, interesting that his family is the third and fourth generation of the family to do it.
I didn't know that. Do you know much about actors?
Tom Cruise actually threatened to do so. The guy who invented the hover board is named Tom Kruse.
That's kind of funny actually, I think a lot of people confused the two names lol, it seems like they would get a lotof people confused.
Did you hear about the guys who pulled off a heist similar to the mission impossible?  They were the guys from "Mission Impossible"
No I did not. But they must have been awesome to do it. Very risky but a success.
Yes. It was not as successful as mission impossible but still made $200 million more than the first movie which was Tom Cruise's. I wonder if he would be successful as Mission Impossible 3 if it had been a movie.
That is a lot of money!  He scaled the tallest building in the UK during the filming of mission impossible 3.  That is a big money.
I wonder if he was wearing safety equipment.
Wow, he was on an airplane on his feet, on the side of the airplane, on his way to the scene, and he did it. I think it creeps me out that they call it "action at 3200 feet" and not "at 5,000! It creeps me right out!" Well it was great chatting with you! Have a great day! I think I'm going to call it a night and go to bed, though.
You too!  Have a good evening!
Are you a fan of Tom Cruise?
I sure am, I like some of his movies, do you?
Seinfeld is worth more than Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks combined.  $500M more than Seinfeld is $500,000,000.
No, I didn't know that.  I didn' t know that either.  Do you remember Cruise in the movie Risky Business back in the 80s?  I liked that movie.
ya I love that movie, hahaha, I haven't seen it, have you?
I loved it too, it was in my senior high school year of my high school.  The soundtrack was huge that summer of 2001.  I think Top Gun was the coctail to it, and Coctail 2 and Top Gun 2.
The cocktail was great!  They made it a bartend!
lol  I never knew that.  haha  Did you know that Aladdin's face was based on Tom Cruise's?  lol
I didn't either. Apparently he has an underground bunker in the UK where he has been.
Wow. The municipal government of Paris passed a resolution to prohibit Tom Cruise from being an honorary citizen of the city.
Well apparently he has something to hide from aliens and that is not okay.
That is right!  I like that mission impossible movie.  Boy lol Tom hung on the side of the airplane when it was soaring at 4200 feet at 50,000 feet in the Mission Impossible movie.
That's pretty cool. I never heard of him doing that many stunts.
I heard that too.  Did you know that the name samurai is plural and refers to the whole clan of samurai, not just Tom Cruise's character.  He's in the movie, right?  The clan of Samurai is plural  and refers only to Tom Cruise character.
Oh that is interesting. I didn't know that, I haven't seen the movie yet. I'll have to look it up later.
I did, I liked it, was it good?
It is. I haven't seen it either. I will one day though. Do you recommend other movies?
lol I think I might like it better, I like mission impossible, the show, and I like Mission Impossible 4 too, I have never seen that one lol what about you?
Yeah, I did, that movie is so bad that I never saw the movie. Nice chatting with you!
Leonard Nimoy played a role on the show. Nice chatting with you as well.
Interesting. Take it easy!
Hello do you like Disney movies?
I love Disney movies. Disney in general is great and it's amazing how far it's come since being founded back in 1923. They're still going strong.
I like the character Minnie Mouse, she is the real name of the dynasty, not the character of the character.
I honestly can't think of one off the top of my head.  Is it a top 10?
Minerva mouse.  Minnie is the name of a mouse,  Minerva Mouse.
Speaking of the Disney stuff, I like her too, I have a thing about finding the hidden mickey mouse images in disney stuff
I did not. Have you ever seen Wall-e?
I honestly don't know! I always thought it was cute though. I always assumed it was just a thought!
It is in honor of Walter Elias Disney apparently.
Oh cool.  That's interesting!  That makes sense.  Disney does some really cool stuff.  They consulted with Bill Nye at one time on the movie Flubber.  He did the voice of the character in the movie.  I've heard that he consulted with Disney before on the film.  It's interesting how some of their stuff is in plain sight most of the time and others are hidden away.  Makes sense why he was consulted on the Movie Flubbert.
Bill was the one who rendered the Big Hero 6 using a 55,000 core computer! That's cool. I wonder how he did it.
That is impressive, that was a beast of an animated film. Emma Watson was the beauty of the live action and not the beauty from an animated or animated film, that is for sure.
I saw the movie, it was pretty well realized, I liked it. Jackie Chan did the voice of the beast, in the Chinese version of the movie.
I bet he did, I'm glad that they did, love the theme song, have you heard that Celine Dion did the theme?
I did not know that the music was composed by the man that did "Mermaid and the Mermaid" and "Pocahontas" "The man of the movies".
Man that is talented.  Those movies had great songs.  He was also the man who did the song in the series Beauty and the Beast, so many of the movies had GREAT songs.
No, I haven't. I did know that Linda Hamilton and Ron pearlman were in it though
Yes it was a good show, the one we were talking about earlier, it is the first live action movie and one of the most expensive movies ever made, probably one of most expensive Movies ever made it was also a good TV show, I really like it, I think it is a good one
Wow! I heard animations used to be expensive, but not that expensive.  I've never seen it.
Hey, I never knew until recently, I heard that about Morgan Freeman, I think he was the one that got the electric company back when he was in it. I think they were trying to get him out of the electricCompany back in 1895.
He's an actor I like.  Nice chatting with you!
Do you like Walt Disney?
Hello there, I do like Disney. Do you?
I do! Did you know that Minnie Mouse's name is short for Minerva mouse?
I never knew that! The Disney channel only runs commericals for their shows and Disney products.
Oh that's cool. There's also a subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey Mouse images throughout Disney things, there's a sub culture dedicated toFinding hidden Mickey mouse images throughout disney things
Very interesting, Disney makes me want to go there more now.
Wow! That's a lot of money!  Did you know Disney's big hero 6 was rendered on a 55,000 core supercomputer?
That sounds impressive!  Walt Disney and Salvador Dali collarborated in a short film called Destino in the 1930s, a short Film called Destinos.
Thats really cool, Bill Nye was the science consultant for Disney's Flubber movie, I think he was the only science consultant they had.
Interesting, I had no idea!  Walt Disney got fired from his job at a local newspaper because he was not creative enough. lol  I wonder why?  Walt DISNEY got fired!  lol
Interesting.  Pixar named Wall-E as a tip of the hat to Walt Disney.  I wonder why?
I had no idea about that, I like that. The beauty of the beast, the beauty of it all
I did!  I liked it, what about you?
I did like it, and it grossed over $8.5 billion dollars worldwide!
Wow!  Jackie Chan provided the speaking and singing voice for the Chinese version of Beauty and the Beast.
Wow! That was one of the most expensive movies ever made! knoew it had a budget of $15 million, I'm glad they recouped their money, it was one the most cost prohibitive movies ever, but I'm sure it was the best, $15 Million is one of their most expensive movie's ever made and I'm knoEW how did they do it!
I agree. The voice of Chip was the boy from jumanji, the voice of chip!
Interesting. I wonder how he did that? Beauty and the Beast was the first animated movie to be nominated for three oscars in the best picture category at the oscARS. It's beauty and the beast was the only animated movie in the picture category.
That is pretty cool. Did you know Celine Dion sings the theme song for the movie?
Correct!    The triplets in the movie are named the Bimbette sisters.   useless fact of the day.  lol  lol
good talking to you!  Have a good one!
Are you a fan of disney movies?
I am a Disney fan.  Are you?
I love Disney, I think it's the favorite right now. What about you?
I have so many all time favorites.  Beauty and the Beast is one of the best, it's hard to imagine not seeing the show at DWW!  I have been a few times and it was so fun.  The show at WDW is one my all time favorite too.
I saw that movie, my wife and I love it, it was so long ago but I still love it!
I like how a man composed the music for the beast Aladdin and the beauty of the mermaid, the Beauty and the Beast.
Wow, that guy is really talented, he must be really talented
He wrote music for Pocahontas, the Hunchback of Norte Dame and Hercules as well as wrote musicfor Pocahoonas.
The guy is definitely getting his paychecks lol.  Jackie Chan has done voice work on China, Beauty and Beast, and writing the music for the live action version for the Beauty and the Beast.  I don't know how much of that voice work he got, but he sure gets paychecks.
I didn't know that version even existed!
Interesting,  Celine Dion launched her career by agreeing to sing the theme song to "be the beast" lol.  That was a beauty.
Beauty and the beast is an animated movie! I didn't care for it but I did not know that it was nominated for 3 Oscars, but it was not in the best picture category. I wonder what the best animated movie is in the BestPicture category at the Oscars.
Wow, that is an amazing feat. I think it set the tone for every Disney movie since then. I was a Morgan Freeman fan. She is the best, she was the first to ever do that.
I don't know the actor, but I know he was born in the UK and was born on the 30s.
Wow! I can't either! I think he was when I was younger, but I loved the movie when I saw it, I think I watched it like every month when I could, I loved it! I had a crazy ending, crazy ending for sure!
I've never seen that one, but heard it was okay, one of my favorites was Driving Miss Daisy.
I have heard great things about that one, I think it's a thriller. I think I will recommend it, I've heard it's really something.
Did you know that Morgan Freeman is a beekeeper?
I heard he is. I would not put it past him to start playing a singing vampire obsessed with vegetables, or the electric company. He would not start playing with the electric companies.
That's crazy, I've never heard that. Nice chatting today, have a good day!
Have a great weekend! I am going to go look into it!
I enjoyed watching Walt Disney movies. He studio makes great movies.
I love it! What is your favorite of the Disney movies?
I like Beauty and the Beast. It's a great one.
It really was. Jackie Chan did the voice in the Chinese version.
I did not! I did not know that! It was so popular that it grossed over $8.5 billion worldwide! That's over $2.5 Billion worldwide and over the globe.
I bet it was!  I guess it was, the boy from Jumani did the voice of chip.  I think the boy was the voice.  He is the voice that did the voices in the first one.
Oh really? That's cool. I never knew that Celine Dion sang the theme which helped launch her to stardom.
Awesome!  Morgan Freeman got the role for that role in one of the movies!
He was great in Driven Miss Daisy, it was a great movie.
Yes that was a great movie.
It was good. I liked the ending, but it might have been more good if Brad Pitt and Freeman hadn't insisted on the ending.
Yes, it would have been a crazy ending with the crazy ending they came up with! Samuel L Jackson was also mentored by Freeman.
Cool. Morgan Freeman has been nominated and won more awards than he has starred in a total number of movies. It's crazy. He has been nominees, won, nominated and lost in the total number number of awards he's been nominated for.
That is crazy, but he is a great actor.  I hear he even dated his niece one time, I hear that.  He dated his sister-in-law, too.
i heard that too!  I also heard that he is obsessed with vegetables.  He played a singing vampire in a movie once.  I never knew that!  He's so kooky.
It was crazy to hear.  Did you know he golfs one handed?  Crazy to hear that he golfing one handed.
He injured his left hand in a car accident and is very sad about that. He is not right, he injured his right hand in that car accident.
He was injured? Was it because of a voice or something?
The Shawshank Redemption was really moving. Have you seen that movie?
I did, I loved the movie. Good chatting with you.
Same!  Great!  You too!  I'm going to watch Invictus now, will you watch it?
Do you like Disney?  I like it.
I do like Disney, great theme parks, great films, great film, great movies.
I like the original Disney, but the new Disney is in Florida, not California as I think they should be in California.
I did know that, Disneyworld is a lot bigger than the one in FL.  It is fun but it is a bit overwhelming.  Disneyworld has to be a lot larger and a lot smaller.
Cool. I've never been to Florida but I've heard that there is a subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey mouse images around Disney parks. Have you ever seen any? I've seen some hidden Mickey Mouse images around the Florida ones.
Yeah, it's very clever and creative. Disney invests a lot in the long term to keep fans intrigued. They want to know the quality, not only the quantity, but the quality.
Have you watched any movies created by Disney?  Did you know Bill Nye was the science consultant for the movie Flubber?  He was the scientist for the science in the movie, and he's also the science consultants for the movies created in the 70's.  Have you seen that one?
I've seen a couple of Flubber, I know Bill Nye has actually made a couple time, I figure he has made aouple time before, right?
I think one of my favorite Disney movies is Beauty and the Beast but I've never seen it. One of my most favorite Disney Movies is Beauty & The Beast.
I liked it a long time ago. It has great songs and it won many awards too.
The film grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide in 2017 making it the highest-grossing live-action musical film.
I thought it was ok, but I thought it did better than the UK remake of the 70s animation, which I guess wasn't all that great either.
Yep it was. Celine Dion reluctantly agreed to sing the theme to Beauty & the Beast when they remade Beauty & The Beast, but it put them on the map.
I guess she had a great voice, so perfect for that song. I guess she was reluctant but it was for the best. She has a greatVoice.
I agree she has a great voice. I like Morgan Freeman too, he is the only American actor to have a great Voice.
He has a great voice, a lot of gravitas, and a lot going on.  His narration is spot on. I loved him in Batman.
Dark Knight was good too. Morgan is a great guy. He started mentoring Samuel L. Jackson in his acting career in the early 1990s. He is also the one who started menting Samuel L.. Jackson, a great person and great guy
He really seems like a great guy off screen, I hope he gets to do more of that, he has been around a long time, and seems a great guys off screen.
Me too.  I guess he has some damage from his car accident, due to nerve damage in his left hand.  He plays golf one-handed, though.  Morgan Freeman has only one left hand too.
lol, I guess the man loves his golf, why does he plays one-handed golf?
That is dedication!  Have a good day!
You too!  Have a nice one!
Thanks.  You too!
Do you know who Morgan Freeman is?
Yeah, he did the latest Disney rendition of the nutcracker for the latest disney rendition of it.
I did not, did he play in the role of the role that I know he is best know for?
He played the Godfather.  It was a really good movie, kind of like The Godfather 2.  I liked it.  Freeman was kind of the lead in that movie, but he was really good in it. Disney usual stuff is really good too.  They did Cinderella, Cirque du Soleil feel, Alice in wonderland, and even Morgan Freeman in The Little Engine That Could.  But I don't know if Disney could do the whole Disney usual lead actor and director stuff again.
Yeah he has been in some great ones. I like that cast a lot. I suppose my favorite film of his is Shawshank.. people love that one, but I suppose that's because of the cast. What is your favorite film?
OMG, Shawshank is my favorite, I loved his character Red.
I think originally Brad Pitt was supposed to be Dufresne. The chemistry between Morgan and Tim was great, though.
Yeah, Tim Robbins was going to be in the role too, but he did not get the role, spoiler alert, Million Dollar Baby, that movie made me cry, that was the best movie ever, and yeah, I liked that movie, too.
Yeah, he really brings a gravitas to the role. Did you know that he was originally going to be the CEO of the Electric company? He was originally on the electric company.
I vaguely remember that, it was amazing. He's an academy award winning actor, but he started out in dancing, kind of like the kids on the show that used a knitted sweater... kind of the same kind of dancing.
yeah, he loved acting. He went to college to study acting. he was in the military too. He seems like an interesting guy.
I love his voice acting for cartoons, I am surprised he only does voice acting on TV now.  He voices a character in the new Lego movie, which I think is a Disney flick, and he also voices a Character in a other Disney flick.
I think he does voice a character in that one. He did great voices for animation in the batman movies. I really wanted him to voice acharacter in the new one. he does great voices.
Well, if Disney got money to spend on a new Disney movie I figure they should utilize his skills. I heard the company makes more than the first ever Disney movie
That's a money maker, I would buy their stock!  They make quality films and their theme parks are great.  I think I would also buy their Stock, it really is a money making company.
Yeah, I've been watching some disney movie with my kids lately.  My daughter loves the live action Beauty and the Beast.  She really loves theLive-Action Beauty and The Beast.
I liked the animated version better.  Its songs were great.
Yes, I love Harry Potter movies and I think the songs were better than the animated version. My daughter is Emma Watson and she really appeals to me more than I personally do with the animated movies. Do you like the animated versions of these movies?
She is such a talented actress! I bet she did a great job in that. Thanks for the chat, you're a really talented actress.
I hope so, it had a solid cast and a solidCast. I'll have to catch it when I have time.
I will, talk to you later, have a good day!
You too!  Thanks!
Do you like Disney?  Did you like it?
Hi, yes I do. I like a few things about Disney. What about you?
Yeah I love Disney. I like Minnie mouse and did you know that Minnie Mouse's name is short for Minerva?
I didn't know that.  I wonder why.  Is Minerva some sort of greek goddess?  Is Minnie not?
Yes it is.  Do you have any favorite Disney movies?
I really like Disney movies. I had an escape to Witch Mountain when I was a kid when I went to Fantasia. What about you?
I liked Fantasia,  but escape from witch mountain was ok,  as a kid I didnt think the whole movie was music,  kinda creepy lol
The movie was a breakthrough in its time, but the accomplishment is that it took so much work-hours to make the movie.  That is a lot of time
Yeah crazy!  Do you remember Beauty and the Beasts?
Yeah, I remember that film. It was catchy. Tons of tunes from that film, like the song "Tale of a Tale". I think the song is a rhyme that the computer did the best at the time, but I can't remember.
Yeah really good songs!  I recently learned that Jackie Chan provided the Beasts voic ein the Chinese version lol.
The guy is amazingly talented as an entertainer.
Yeah he is amazing and super funny, I think so too.
I expect more amazing movies to come from him. He was in the movie Big Hero 6 which was rendered using a supercomputer. It was made using 1.39M computers. I expect more Amazing movies will be rendered by then.
Yes, that movie was awesome. I had no idea it took that much power to make that movie.
Me either.  Celine Dion is a beast.  Her theme for Beauty and the Beast was from the theme for Beautiful.  I didn't know that.
I thought she did it because she is Angela Lansbury, right?
Yes she played a character but also sang, she sang "Celine" in the radio release version and she was in the 1957 radio release of the movie, she played the character.
Oh that makes sense, I'm all for it! I think that's awesome she did. I think she was awesome! A man composed music for Aladdin, Hercules, Aladdin (the Hunchback of Notre Dame), and Pocahontas, I think it was Hercules, and the man composed the music for the mermaid and beauty and the beast as well as the HunchBACK of Notre Dame. I wonder if he did the music too?
Alan Menken must be pretty rich, talented, and talented, he had a good sense of melody, at this point.
Yeah,  yeah he must be.  lol  Great talking to you!
Did you see when Jackie Chan acted in Beauty and Beast?
He provided speaking and singing voice in Chinese version!
Thanks for listening to the song and for the chat.
Nice.  Do you know that the Walt Disney Company is known as simply Disney or just Disney?
That is true. I recently went to the Walt Disney Museum. It's a big blessing for Walt to be able to do what he does. He has such an imaginative mind.
It is the world's largest independent media in terms of revenue.  The company was found by walt and roy in 1923.
That's crazy! Bill Nye the science guy was a consultant on the movie flubber, he is the science consultant on that movie.
That is crazy, I would definitely have to watch flubber, it is full fo humor to watch.
I think Bill Nye was doing science experiments to create flubber to try to add more effect to it.
Freeman has served narrator or a commentator for numerous programs and television shows.
He has been nominated and won a lot of rewards.
He is a multi talented person, he played every other role in the role he was in, he is a very multi talented Person.
Yes, and for his role as the singing vampire who loved vegetables, he was the best.
Have you watched the movie, Chronicles of Narnia?
Yes, but the first sequences of the movie was extroardinary. I did not watch the rest of theMovie.
It was.  Kids are loved to watch it.  Walt Disney was the first animated movie to be done by Disney.
I forgot about that one!  Walt Disney's talent is so many.  I like the animated "It" movie because I think the effects were great.  It was animated.
Nice.  What kind of movies do you like?  Do you like movies where the scenes are graphical?
It is a movie that is passed down from generation to generation.  It has mild peril, a musical and a family-friendly movie moves from "the Nutcracker" to "the mild peril"  The movie moves well from one movie to another.
It's a Fantasy story, and it's a Chistmas time entertainment.
That is a great feeling, I am looking forward to it.
I know! Well, I'm happy to chat with you! Have a great day!
You too. Thanks! You too!
Thank you.  I do too!
Thanks! You too! :)
Did you know they have a Disney nutcracker?
I did not, but I like Disney. What about you?
I love Disney, it brings out the best in me, I have been to Disney since I was a child.
Oh yeah!  What are some of your favorite Disney movies?
I loved the cartoon beauty, the lion king, beast, mermaid, and the lion.  I loved the Cartoon beauty, beast and the mermaid when I was growing up.  Those are all iconic cartoons.  What about you?
Yeah me too, I like the little mermaid one the best, Aladdin, Lion King, Frozen, Frozen 2, Moana, yeah me too!
Yeah, they were the stuff I didnt know. I really liked Minnie's real name, Minerva, I think.
I never knew that, I wonder why? Maybe it was short for something else?  Did you know the Disney channel doesnt accept outside ads?
I didnt! I guess I never noticed that, but I think that the ads were internally related to the show, right? I guess not.
yeah,  i don't watch the disney channel,  but i like their movies.  lol ironic that walt disney was fired from his newspaper job for not being creative with his movies. lol  He was the most creative!
Yeah, he showed them, but his work will live on forever, the parks and all.
They are putting in the star wars land which is an area in Disneyland in California.  I wonder what it is called?  It's going to be the starWars land, or whatever they are putting it in.
Wow, I haven't watched Disney World in Orlando develop in a few years so I'm sure it will be neat.
Very cool, I have not been but I think I have been there for years now.
I live an hour away, but it's a huge trip just to go to one.  That's a good way to see it, but I don't live an Hour from it.
Oh cool.  The recent beauty, the beast,  is the most recent beauty.  lol
No, havent, Ill go now.  Im on Netflix right now.
I think its weird that Belle does a british accent and not France lol, I think it's weird that Belle does not want to be in France lol
I guess in the cartoon she doesnt have that part.
Yeah, that's why she does not have her accent in the cartoons.
The only cartoon I know that was british is the teapot, lumiere, from the teamiere of the teaot.
lol weird. Anyway, great chatting with you!
Hey, did you watch the Oscars this year? They gave out the set of 24 awards for the accomplishments of the film industry. I'm set to go watch the next one, what about you?
Yes I did watch this year.  Did you know Daniel Day Lewis is one of my favorite actors and he's the only actor to win it 3 times.  I wonder how many other actors have previously won and why he's only the only one to win.
Yeah I think he is a great actor, I think the movie Blazing Saddles was nominated for 3 oscars, I saw it, and yeah he is great, I like the movie.
Wow, that's surprising. Eminem has more Oscars than Decaprio, Depp, Lucas, Murray, Murray and Will Smith combined. That's surprising!
It's hard to believe!  But he's an actor so that makes sense.  Walt Disney to this day holds the record for most Oscars won by an actor with 22.  I guess he was an actor too.  That man was the man!  I wonder how many Oscars he has won and how many oscars won.  He has the most Oscars, by the way.
I have heard that but I can't say that I think he deserves it. There is probably a more iconic film than Disney that has more Oscars than that. It deserves more than 20 Oscars.
I totally agree, he was nominated for 13 oscars, 9 emmys and was once nominated for 9 emmy's.
Funny, Meryl Streep has only won 3 Oscars, the only actress to have been nominated for 3 Oscars in that generation, and she won all of them! I wonder if she's the only one to do so?
Yeah she is a great actress, she has a great daughter who plays the FBI agent and also an actress's daughter who play a robot, so yeah.
I wonder if she won any of the Academy Awards. Meryl Streep has been nominated for 9 academy awards and has never won one but has been nomination for 5 golden globe nomination.
That is incredible! She has won three times, she has placed 3rd place in all the awards. That is incredible. I wonder why she only won three?
The movie Julie with Meryl Streep is a great and makes me very hungry each time I watch it. Have you seen it? It is great and made me hungry eachtime I watch. Have You seen the movie Julie?
No I haven't but I will add it to my list. I thought it was really good, another really good actress is Emma Watson, from the Harry Potter series, another good actress to add to your list.
I love the Harry Potter films. I can't believe Daniel Radcliffe turned down the director of prisoner of azkaban made him because Rupert Grint was the director.
That is hilarious!  Emma almost considered not playing Hermione from the series, it would have been devastating to not play her in Half Blood Prince.
I am glad that she decided to continue to go on to play the role.  I think she is the best.  Did you ever watch "The last one"?
I agree. I would love to see Emma as a certified yoga teacher, she could take a class.
That is fantastic!  I was surprised to find out that Margot Robbie was actually born in the age of 15, I did not know she was born in that age.
Yeah I agree, that is surprising! Yeah, I was in dragon school and had the chance to talk with her about her star studded classmates. It sounds like they were nice, but not very surprising.
Yes, she did.  She taught Meryl Streep, Julia, Julia (Julie) T., and Stanley Tucci.  I'm sure they all did a great job.  Well, it was nice talking to you!  Make sure to watch lots of movies with actors in it, make sure to see if they cook before the film!  I like to cook before movies so I can watch lots!
I will look for it, thanks again!
Hi there!  Do you watch the Academy Awards regularly?
I do! It's kind of a joke and people don't know that it is a joke, but it's one of the best award shows, I think. I think it is crazy the Eminem has won more oscars than many actors combined, I kind of think he is owed some credit for that, but I think that's just crazy the eminem has won so much and still doesn't get the credit he is due.
I wonder how many Oscars Eminem has won. I think Eminem has win many Oscars.
I know he is a good rapper, but the lyrics stand out a lot for him. It shocks me that the Oscars were nominated for 9 Emmys in 2013. I'm surprised he didn't win. He's a lot of the times a really good rapper. The Oscars are not known to be known for their win/losses.
Me either! I didn't know that. The film industry has been around since 1929 officially.
No, I guess he's just investigating how many times Blazing Saddles won "Best Movie" a few times, but I have no idea what movie that was, lol. I guess I will have to look that up after this.
I wonder if Leonardo Decaprio is a real actor yet Eminem has won more awards than him? I don't know if he is a actor yet eminem has won so many awards
I agree, I think that Meryl Streep is more deserving than most of the actors listed here, she has won for her talent multiple times so she is definitely recognized and more deserving of being won than the other actors listed, but she is a talent multiple ways.
Meryl Streep has more Oscars than Eminem?
I agree, I think she should get more. Emma Watson has been in so many. People love her and hate her and people love her because she speaks on so many different subjects.
I don't follow her that much, but I liked some of the Harry Potter films.
I know that some people like her, I don't.
Yes, and she wrote a long essay compared to the candidates, and a movie about them. She wrote along essay compared them to the movie
She wanted the role and she is dedicated to it so she really wanted to do it right, she was the only choice so she was going to go back and continue to play the character and then the other left, she is very dedicated, she really wants to play it and wanted the Role so she can come back and Continue to play.
I know.  That is why she decided to stay.  There are so many other people to play the role and she was one of the only people to do it.
That is a good choice, switching a main character can ruin the movie, and that is why switching a character can spoil the movie for everyone else.
I know right?  How do you do that?
I like Beauty and the beast. It brings back memories of childhood. I don't have access to it but I know it is on Netflix. I have access now. Do you have Netflix?
She did such a voice in Beauty and the Beast!  I don't like girly movies, do you?
Yes she was in that one. It's a cartoon, a modern version, where she plays a real human and not a cartoon!
What about the cartoon version of beauty and the beast? Is that the cartoon's version of Beauty and the Beast?
I haven't seen that either.  I don't have access to the Netflix, do you?
Well thanks for all the info. It was nice talking with you.
Hello there, do you watch the Academy Awards?
I do.  I hear that Daniel Day-Lewis is the only actor to win best actor at the Oscars 3 times.  He is the first actor to do so.  Do you know why?
Nice!  I did not know that!  No, I didn't.  I read Blazing Saddles was nominated for three Oscars.  Can't remember which movie. LOL  Can you remember whichMovie it was?
That's surprising that they got 3 oscars.  Walt Disney holds the record for most oscar's.
Yeah I love their movies, Disney is amazing, I am a huge Disney fan,  yeah I love them so much.
Did you know that eminem has more oscars than dicaprio, depp, smith, smiths, lucas, de la murray combined, and eminem
Wow, that's interesting.
I'm not sure. I don't watch Golden Globes. But interestingly Streep has won 3, but has only 2 nominations. She has never won for best actor.
Nice, she is awesome and so good, she has been awesome for a while.
She has won threePrimetime Emmy Awards!
Wow I didnt know Meryl Streeps daughter was a robot, that is so cool
It's a fun movie! Interestingly enough, Stanly Tucci is an incredible cook! He made Meryl Streep cook twice to prepare for Julie and Julia to help him prepare for Julia!
That is awesome,  that must have been awesome, I wonder how much they got paid lol while making a movie.  I would like to see Stanley Tucci teach himself how to cook lol
Streeps first film role was in a sports movie. It was a sports film.
Amazing. Emma Watson was in the Dragon School which is a prestigious school to train dragons to become dragons. It sounds like a place that could be prestigious.
I didn't know that.  Director Alfonso Cuaron had Daniel Radcliffe and other actors write essays for the filming of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  During the filming, he had the actors write an essay on the characters with Watson pumping the brakes on their characters with Watts pumping them up.
Yeah I heard about that lol
Did you ever watch "Half Blood Prince"? I liked Watson in it. She was going to be playing Hermione but changed her mind and went with Watson.
I know Emma and Margot Robbie both had to trip over each other at that age, so if she didnt play her it wouldve been heart broken, at least she didn't. It would have been heartbroken for Emma and margot Robbie
Sounds like something Watson would do! He was born in Paris and raised in Oxfordshire.  I didn't know she was born there.  She was born to be born in paris and raised here in the UK.
Nice!  Thats awesome!  It's been fun chatting, have a good one!  Have a awesome one!
Hello, did you ever play with nintendo?
Hello there, I did have a Nintendo and play for so long, how about you?
I believe it's been around over 30 years and started as a playing card company, which is a long time and not just a playing one.
Yeah they have come a long way from being just a toy company.
True, they even produced a knock off lego once
Wow, those are some smart business people! on the other hand, I'm not sure how they did that!
That is true, but I would say that the Seattle Mariners are a good investment, I like them.
Wow, that's good for them! Pokemon is so good, they even released a console for it.
Wow that is dedication! Do you use an Xbox or an xbox?
I have never had one. I think it's nice to make consoles for quadriplegics. That's thoughtful.
True. I wonder how long they have been around. The original one made creepy noise and that was a long way from being useful.
Wow. A guy once spent $30 at a carnival in hopes to win an xbox and won a banana with dreadlocks.
Wow, money well spent. The army uses the xbox 360 controllers to fly spy planes in the army.
Wow pretty cool, do you know what video games used to be called?
Yeah it was the cathode ray tube amusement devices.  funky name.
Wow! I'm happy they changed it to video games, they have come a long way since then. What about video games?
I like that too. Do you know who does the voice of Woody in video games?
Yes that is Jim Hanks the brother of Tom Hanks
Yeah I guess talent runs in the family. We are a family of video games. There are more hours of video game we play in a week than there is of any other planet.
Hmm, I'm not sure to be honest. I don't know how they calculate that to be more honest.
Yeah, a game designer calculated that it is because they use it 3 billion hours a week.
Wow that is mind blowing.
Hi, did you ever play Nintendo?
Yes, I did.  They were the first company to do so and have been around for more than 40 years now.  How about you?
I know, it is one of the world's largest video game companies.  I play with my kids.  They have a Nintendo, I think it is the world largest videoGame companies.
They are, and before they were a toy company, they made playing cards that were the type of legos, they even made playing card of the toy company
Huh, that is neat. I love hotel.
I have never heard of it, I wonder if it was ever a game?
Yes, it is. It was something Nintendo tried back in the day.
I guess Nintendo's name is Yamauchi after the founder of it.
No idea. I have never heard of him. Have you heard of the game "F-Zero" by the way?
Yes it's the racing game, the first racing game that came out in 2003
I heard that it is a racing game to run at 60 frames per second.
Me either. Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners and had a nintendo for 40 years back.
That's crazy.  I wonder how things end up.  Did you know thatXbox is made by Microsoft?  It's crazy that it's made by Redmond.
I did not!  I have an Xbox, but I also have Nintendo.  Did you know the army uses them to fly UAV spy planes?
Wow! A Canadian teenager once settled with the court and exchanged his domain name mikerowesoft.com for an Xbox and games from Microsoft.
I wonder if he was a teenager or if he just wanted cash?  Microsoft?
I know right, it's crazy that a man spent $40 on a carnival game to win an xbox 360, and won a banana with dreadlocked, that's crazy
That is crazy! I would never buy an xbox. South Korea has laws that say if you play video games, you have to own a xbox 360. Thats not a lot of value but late at night kids are up late at Night kids are, it is crazy.
I did not know that.  I wonder why they would want them to be up that late?  What is up with that?
No I don't know, I just know they don't play past midnight.
Wow. I didn't know that. Gremlins doesn't play after midnight.
I guess they get into some kind of legal trouble.  I don't know the law, but I know they're in some kind Of legal trouble for that.
Hi, do you play video games?
Heck yeah!  I'm a playstation gamer.  How about you?
Cool.  I played the first xbox original.  lol
I still like Nintendo. I have never tried it though.
Yeah I still play wii ocassionally
Did you ever play splat on wii or wii sports on Nintendo?
I like wii sports, what about you?
I used to have a Nintendon 64 around mid-90s
Yeah I think that was around the 80s too. I remember my parents getting Pong, lol.
Have you ever played video games? I used to have an Atari.
Nice.  Did you have a Nintendo?
Yes I did, my brothers used to play it, but I never got around to it, did you?
Cool. I used to play Xbox a lot. I didn't play splinter cell though.
XBox was the name of the sega Genesis video game system.
I can't imagine that we would be passing the law like south korea where kids have to be at least 16 to play past midnight, but I can't see us passing the laws like south Korea where kids under that age can't even play past 16
I think that I would like to have a rule similar to that one here in the US. I would not want to be the one in the house with a rule like that. LOL.
That is smart, but I hada step son who did not want to implement it because his mother never supported him to play for 3 hours straight.
Wow! She made a lot of money in the video game industry, too!
Yeah for the most part. Did you know there are 3 billion hours of video games a week?
My stepson is, he says to watch the ratings on video games before buying them.
I don't, but it seems like a losing battle.
My favorite game of all time is Atari's Chuck E Cheese game.
Hi, have you ever played Mario Kart?
Yes, I have! One of the games released for consoles in 2003.
It's pretty good. It's like an amusement park that's a racing game. You do things like mario kart in the amusement park and other things like that.
That is awesome, I wonder how popular it is in terms of racing game revenue.
Yes, it is. I played it so much my brother bought it for me.  The whole series sold over 50 million copies!
Oh wow, that is really cool! That is so cool. I think I will go play it again this night! Did you know it is illegal for kids under 16 to play video games in South Korea past 12? That is just like how it is Illegal for kids to play Video Games in Southorea past 8.
I didnt know that, thats unfortunate for the kids,  thats unfortunate
Yes, I think so.  They play three billion hours of video game every week worldwide.  It was odd that they added in 2012 that there are more than 3.5 billion hours and have added that we play three Billion hours of game every year!
I know!  I know that we are gamers...  Did you know that in the 1930s video games were called cathode ray tube amusement devices, and now they are called cathodes ray tube entertainment devices?
No, I didnt know that!  That is nuts.  Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners!  I think they are nuts as well.
I didnt know that either. That is a fun fact. I definetely have to look that one up next time I gather with friends, it is definetelys a fun fun fact to know.
yeah, I'll have to look that one up. I'll use the app and get my food directly to my seat, I wonder if you can get your own food from there, or get food directly from the app itself.
I like this app, did you ever play Mario Kart with fiends?
Yeah, Nintendo released a handheld console in the 90s.  Pokemon back then was real popular, but that was before the 3DS era.  Nintendo released the first Pokemon back in 2001.
I loved to play Pokemon. I never really played the game or watched the series. Have you played the Game or watched it?
I have watched the series, but did not play the game, I used to play on the Nintendo 64 for years, but never on Nintendo 64.
I didnt know it had been that old for that many years, I didnt think that many games had been out for that much time and that many of them were just games, but yes it is
I think it was started in 1889 as a playing card company?
I didnt know that, I thought they were American, but I thought it was a Japanese multinational company, not American
Yeah, the Japanese are the ones that own it. In fact they are the most-valuable company, they own like 104 billion dollars, that's why they areJapanese.
They have some great games and a lot of great games
Hello. How are you?
Hi, I am great! How are you? Do you play video games?
I used to play video games but gave them up because I got married.  I used to be able to play games but given up.
I used to play some.  I think they are what we call video games, but the military used to call video game cathode ray tube amusement devices, which are not video games at all.
I wonder what they call it now? It rolls off the tongue but I'm not sure what they would call it.
I guess the military thought it would make them sound better.  Nintendo has been over 40 years old since it was started in 1889 as a playing card company and it was the first Nintendo.  That is quite something.
Did you know in Austin you can play a real life Mario Cart?
That sounds like fun! I bet Waterloo Labs had fun with that, making a "Mario Kart Wii" game and selling it for $15.  I think Mario Kart is the best selling racing game ever, and I bet Winnipeg Labs had a fun making it.
That's surprising. I thought Gran Prix, Mario Kart, or even Mario Kart 8 would be up there. I bet Logic would beat them.
He is so good at what he does. I know rappers can do it. I wonder how he won all of those battles and who won.
I wonder if rappers are also good at Mario Kart, coins make them go faster and stop them from spinning when they are good at Mario Kart.
Interesting. I didn't know that the items were not random but meant to balance out power among players.
Yes, I know.  Nintendo is such a toy company.  Did you know Nintendo produced knock off legos?  Weird that they did that.  I know they are now a toycompany.
I wonder what other things they did.  There were video games made by the company before the big crash of the company.  They released a handheld for Pokemon in the market before they released the first video games.
Huh, I wonder why.  Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners, huh?
They are a Huge company, they are the nintendo of america. I love hotels, I have been to Seattle, I love it. I think that they are a huge company, I really love hotels.
I used to love playing Legend of Zelda
I have never played Zelda. I know it is popular, but I am busy with other games. I guess Tom Hanks does Woody's voice in some video games too. I don't know how big of a part he is in video culture, but Jim Hanks do Woody's. I can see why he is a part of the popular culture, since he is so busy and big in the movies.
No, I didn't know that, I wonder why he does?  By the estimates, we play 3 billion hours of video games every week!  That's over 3 billion years of video game!
Video games have replaced television as the favored distraction, Jane McGonigal's fault, not ours.  Video games have replace television as our favored distraction.
Jane is definitely up to something.  Nice chatting with you.
Are you a video game fan?
Yeah, I am actually, I liked Nintendo back in the day, they are one of the world largest video game companies. Did you know that?
They do, but they are facing a lot of competition these days.  Do you like any games you like to play?
I used to play old school games like Zelda, Transylvania, and Mario, and some of the old school, old schoolgames that were more like pro wrestling. Did you know that Mario is one of the top selling video game franchises? I wonder why? Zelda is also one of three of the best selling videoGame franchises?
I like the old Super Nintendo and the sega, I play computer games now. I like the new stuff but I also like video games, I played F-zero, Super Nintendo, football games, and some other stuff.
I played it a ton in college and also alot of my high school football games, especially Madden. F-Zero was pretty cool, I played it alot but it didn't run at 40 fps like some racing ones, or even Madden, which is cool that it can run at 60 fps.
I played a lot of Madden. I learned a lot about football from it. I also play Gameboys and the genesis and I play a lot, also football games.
I played that game, I wish I would have played that. It was specifically for pokemon. It came out specifically for Pokemon!
Me neither.  I played GB back when they came out, but I didn't really like the games.  Most people didn't like the platform.  Did you ever played GB games?
Yeah, Nintendo has been around a long time.  It has reinvented itself every few hundred years, but never reinvented themselves.
Yes, they have.  They are definitely a force in the industry.  And designed some great games too.  A force to be reckoned with.
Agreed. They've branched off into other sports ownership, though. They own the Seatle Mariners now, and the Mariners have their own sports ownership.
I am surprised that it wasn't in Seattle. I wonder why. They are the Nintendo of America.
There is a large Japanese influence in Seattle. In 1889 Fusajiro Yamaucho founded Nntendo.
I wonder if the company is still around. I think they make some kind of playing cards, but I don't know how much of a market they have these days. I wonder why he still has the company.
I don't understand why those games aren't popular, but my brother in law says the "viedeo" games are.  He plays the Magic game with his kids, but it's funny how they don't seem to understand how much they mean to us.  I wonder if the game is popular in other parts of the world?  In South Korea, it's illegal to play after midnight if you're under 16.  It's the same in South Korea where it's legal to play Vyingeo.
I think that's a little too much. I can't imagine what kids are up at night playing after they should be studying.
That makes sense, but it's still unfathomable that as a planet we play three billion hours of video games a week.  Police say as a whole planet we're play three Billion hours ofVideo games a year.  That is unfathomability, even to police.
People get addicted. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!
Same here, have a great day!
Thanks, you too!  You too!
Hello, do you like Nintendo?
Yea, I have Mario Kart
Nice, there are coins in Mario kart made to help you go faster, maybe the coins are the best.
Yea, I remember collecting a bunch of coins and then spinning around like a turtle shell when I hit one in the turtle shell.
It is illegal for kids under 16 in south Korea to play video games past midnight.
That law is ridiculous.  I don't think kids should play past midnight, make it so.  That law is really ridiculous.
Yeah, it is pretty absurd. Nintendo produced a lego knock off, I think that was in 2003, I can't believe it.
I did not know that. I did know they made playing cards, though.
Yeah I don't remember it being a card company but they were founded in 1886 I think, I think it was founded as a card Company right?
Yea it was, do you like the Seattle Mariners?
True.  They really have.
Yea, they also order food direct to your seat at a mariners game, you can even get a seat right on the field
That is pretty cool, I would recommend the 3DS and Xbox over Nintendo for sure.
Probably the xbox. I just bought a switch for the xBox and I basically play mario and pokemon lol.
I wonder if that is a game console or a mini thing?
Yea, I used to play the switch, but now I play the Switch 2 handheld
Interesting. I will have to check out some of the newer games.
There are also deluxe versions of mario kart and new versions of Mario and Zelda, so it has old games like Mario and Nintendo 64 games likeMario Kart.
Oooh, that sound cool.  I need to go play games now.  It was so nice chatting with you!
Same here, I'm gonna play some F-Zero now.
Nice, take it easy!
Did you know Nintendo is over 100 years old?
Yes, it's awesome!  I loved F-Zero that game.  I was so fast in that racing game.
That was a good game. They started as a playing card company that also owned the Mariners.
Did you ever play the game Pokemon back when they made a handheld system for the game pokemon? They made a portable system for that one.
I don't know but I heard that you can install an app that will allow you to order food from the Mariners games and also from the Japanese market, so you can order food in the Japanese Market
I don't know.  Nintendo has been making video games for more than 40 years now.  They started making playing cards originally.  To think of what they are so good at makes me hungry!  Nintendo was actually making playing card originally.
I think it's awesome that Xbox has controllers for quadriplegics in their consoles.
Nice!  I remember when Xbox 1's launch day came out back in 2004,  my parents had it when I was in school lol.  launch day was back then,  back when I first got one in school LOL
I wish I had spent $40 to win an Xbox One from a carnival game where you had to become a banana with dreadlocks. My son would probably end up being a banana too, but he didn't end up becoming a carnivals game, but that's what it took to win one!
Haha, lol yep he would have bought the xbox 360.  The army uses xbox360 controllers and they're cheaper than making custom ones apparently, $300 is cheaper than makes custom ones
My friend's son is an UAV pilot and he voices Woody in games and merchandise.  Tom Hank's brother voices Woody because he's Tom Hank brother's best friend's brother and he is an old UAV Pilot.
Yeah that's interesting, I remember seeing something similar on the screen, I don't remember it being brothers haha.  But yeah that's crazy, apparently they are brothers but no pun was intended lol that'scrazy!  I left the Xbox 360 on for a long time and didn't hear anything about it,  apparently it was left on for quite a time since it was first left on the shelf.  lol
That is weird! Almost as weird as games being called cathode ray tube amusement devices, which is what they were by the military in the US and was called cathODE ray tube amusement devices.
That sucks the fun out of video games lol, did you know that humans used to play 4 billion hours of video Games a week?  We play 4.5 billion hours a year,  that sucks the joy out of it.
I did not know that.  I did know that South Korean kids have a rule where they can't play games after midnight but I can't abide by that rule.  What do you think they mean by that?  Do you abide by the rule?
Yeah I think that's a problem because I had that problem as a kid haha. Stephen Fry did the narration for a lot of movies and even for Harry Potter video games, he did the Harry Pottervideo games for the Harry potter video games and a lot more than a lot  of other movies, I wonder if he did a movie or two as a little kid
Yeah I do know his narration for the Big Planet.
Wow, I did not know that. I did know he played the hitchhiker guide to the galaxy game, did you read the book or watch the movie? If you read it, read the Book or watch The Hitchhiker's guide to a galaxy game?
I did not. I wonder if there are any lego knock-offs that Nintendo produced? I wonder what the list of all the lego Knock-offs is?
I used to collect lego, I had a lot of the counterfeit lego in my collection, I'm not sure if they're worth any money, but they sound interesting, I'd be mad if they were worth anything lol, do you collect legos?
I guess some classify video games as an art form, like the architecture series, but I would think it is more of an art forms.
I spend a lot of time on Xbox live, miss the days of the old online video games, but I do spend a little time on xbox 360 too.
Hi, how are you doing? Do you think we are the guardians of the galaxy?
I love that movie! Have you seen it?
I dont usually watch superhero films but I hear it is pretty funny, there is a lot of explosions and some dialog and some pretty funny ones.
It has some pretty funny content. Netflix has it as Vhina: An Interplanetary unusual attack team and the interplanetary unprecedented attack team. I saw that Taiwan renamed the movie "The Last" to "Netflix" because Netflix is where the content of the movie came from and the name came from.
That sounds a bit stilted.  Heck kind of like it.  Sounds a bit like it could have come out in the UK.
lol its ridiculous!  It doesnt roll off the tongue very fast,  and it doesnt roll of the tongue at all!
Yeah, I can't either. Chris Pratt is a funny guy, gotg a really funny guy.
Yeah he is, hes one of the main characters, he is funny and I like his movies, he can be funny in his own right.
Did you know he has a restaurant in Hawaii he used to work at?  I have seen pictures of his work.  It's a restaurant that has the best pictures ever.
Wow that is quite awhile ago.  I didn't know that.  James Gnn wanted Chris Pratt to get the part of the actor lol.  He wanted chris pratt to do the cgi and pack it in.  That was a pack of them lol
That is funny! I liked chris pratt in the first Jurassic Park movie and I expected him to get the part. I think he did well in the second one.
Yeah, I guess not.  I didn't know he was in jurassic park.  Depps move to the galaxy was a move for sure.  Johnny Depps go visit sick children.  They stole his outfit from guardians of the galaxy.
Yeah, Johnny is a great guy, he does that to help out hospitals and the kids must love him. He's a great guys. I wonder what Jack Sparrow's outfit was.
Yeah, that is awesome!
Do you follow disney much as a kid?
I love Disney! I did too but my kids, they sucked so I never went. Do you like it?
I havent seen the new disney film yet.  Do you have a recommendation for a new Disney film?
I like some disney movies.  Coco, wreck it ralph,  Moana,  coco 2,  frozen,  incredibles 2, and  wreck it r Ralph.  all good ones.  Pixar is also good too.  I dont really like the songs in their movies.
I wonder how many songs, and if any are written by them.  It was fun!  Great chat!
Great chatting with you as well!
You too! Have a great evening! Take care!
Thank you! You too!
Hey there! Do you know much about the Disney company?
I do. They fired James Gunn of Guardians of the Galaxy fame for saying they don't need anyone like him.
Is Minnie Mouse his real name?
I think Minerva Mouse. Bill Nye consulted with Disney of Flubber, but I don't know why Bill NYE consulted with Disneyland
I didn't know that.  I like the guy, did you ever watch Wall-E?
No, I didn't. I didn' t even know Mary Poppins is animated, is it animation?
Apparently the new movie is using cgi and a pack of new actors, you mentioned James Gunn earlier, I think he's the new actor.  They wanted Chris Pratt to be in it but they just couldn't find the right actor, they also used a new cgi for the movie.  Did you know that when they were looking for an actor, the wanted Chris Pratt?
hee!  I think that is a little too much exercise!  Gunn was fired appropriately for his offensive tweets, but I'm sick of all this court of public opinion stuff.  He needs to be fired appropriately.
I think so too. In China the movie was renamed inerplanetary unusual attack team.
I guess they did a lot of editing for "vol. 1 in China"
Yeah, I wonder if the Mary Poppins line was actually libbed from the novel or just a libbed one.
Yes that was Julie Andrews, she was just joking. Big Hero 6 used a 55,000 core computer because she needed more than one, it was a 55000 coreComputer.
Chris Pratt is an actor?
Sorta, I think he's ok. I liked him in the new one that he cast him in with Dennis the D.C. Dennis. I like Glenn Howerton as the lead in Guardians of the Galaxy, it's sunny in Philadelphia, I like him as the cast of Guardians.
Apparently he was nineteen and waiting tables when he was discovered and then discovered it.
I watched parks and recreation on TV all the time. It is the place to be. I really like Pratt.
I loved that show. He stole the costume from me when they did the guardians of galaxy movie. He is so good in that movie. When he visits kids in the hospital, he looks like he is doing it for the kids. He even visits kids that he stole the costumes from in the Guardians of galaxy.
Wow, that's cool. He should pay more attention to those he helps! Disney is so huge now. They owned ESPN from 1997 to 2018. That's so cool!
Apparently when James Gunn was fired in 2013, the cast signed letters asking Disney to rehire him, and he did.  He has since been on.  Did you know that all of the cast signing letters askingDisney to re hire him?
It was crazy that he was fired over things like that.  I know that GOTG grossed like $1B over a decade ago, but that is just over a dozen.
I know. Nice chatting with you
Have you heard of the Astro Bot Rescue Mission "game"?  It's a game that rekindles the fun gaming that was once jaded by the game 2048.  It is an Astro Bot Rescue mission that reckles thefun gaming in us.
I have not, is it for the PlayStation or the PS4?
I dont have a playstation either, apparently it was really popular, but not as popular as the PS4, apparently.
I am scared that robots will take over the world.
Aww, I think we are headed for that.  They are taking alot of jobs, I am sure.  I would like to see a universal income, atleast for those that can't get it themselves.
yeah that is what it says. I want to debone my chicken with that! LOL.
Here's hoping!  I don't care for them.  Michael Jackson planned to build a moon walking robot that would roam around the desert sands of Las Vegas that would be 10 foot tall.  He was hoping to build it in 2020.  If he did, it would be a walking moon walker and roam the desert of Las Las Vegas.
lol, I could see rats controlling a robot.  Taking over the world and not me taking over.  LOL
OMG.  I have read that before.  That would be something!
The government wants us to use playstations instead of robot rats.
I will send that idea to the secret plan, the consoles are made in China, I wonder if they have a secret plan for that, they are made there
Funny a soccer game spanned three playstation generations and is an international sport.
Wow!  Nintendo produced a lego knock-off when it was only a toy company.  Nintendo produces a legos now.
Did you know Nintendo owned the Seattle Mariners?
I did not know that. Nintendo released a handheld console specifically for Pokemon.
Nintendo should build a 50 foot robot in memory of Michael Jackson, a 50 feet foot robot.
That's crazy. What would they do with it? I wonder.
I wonder if he played grand theft auto.
No I haven't. I know that it is ninetendo to be in the market right now for around $1 billion. It is Japan's third most-valuable company and in Japan third most -valuable companies.
That is aweful!  I was a long time ago!
I bet you are right! I would not be interested in it. Very violent.
Yeah, I stuck with Nintendo games because they were very friendly.
I like this.. On December 16, 2003, the launch of the original Playstation in Japan. I think this was the first Playstation in japan.
Did you know the playstations early consoles supported linux base?
Strange. The original console was the first video game console to ship, and it was the last series of the series. It was the best selling video game consoles of 2014, with over 58 million units.
wow that is something, did you know that when you compare a video game to an amusement park it is like you are at an amusementpark?
I'm not sure either.
I guess it's something that played Astrobot Rescue.
Did you know the PlayStation 4 was released on 2003 and in November of 2007 sold over 60 million consoles worldwide?
That is crazy. Did you know robots can play video games?
Maybe, I'm not sure! On July 26, 2011 the PlayStation network had 137 million users worldwide. That's awful for an online service.
The game runs on just 54 frames per second, which is crazy realistic.
It really is.  People really like their consoles.  I know that PlayStation is the best-selling home console to date.  As of December 2017, they had reached over 100 million units sold.  They reached that in 2016 and it was the bestseller and best- selling home console since the Playstation II.
Have you ever played Legend of Zelda games?
I am not a big gamer, I have a playstation but the US department of defense used the alternative, the Playstation 3 to build a supercomputer, cheaper than the one they used to build, to build the supercomputer
No not anymore, but I still wanna hear the GTA soundtrack
It was supposed to be really good. I think it was good!
I'm not sure, but I'm sure it is. Are you a fan of soundtracks?
I like to play it when I have time and I try to stay away from the brilliant visual that comes with it. It taunts me for neglecting it and it taunts us when it doesn't stay.
I will have to check it out and see what it is about, it must be about destiny.
Destiny 2: Forsaken seems to be addictive and fun to play, I like the first one, I have not tried it.
It really is. Did you know rats controlling the robots can play destiny?
That would be fun. robots can be embedded in them and guided by the external control device, but they need to have one embedded in the robots.
Grant Imahara created a robot that can do everything.
Robots are machines designed to perform a task, and are constructed in such a way that they are able to do so. In that regard, robots are machinesdesigned to take the human form.
Craig Feinstein was a sidekick of the character.  He was the sidekick to the character of Craig Feguson.
That would be fun!  It would be a hit.
Yeah,  that was fun!
I thought it was as well. Nice talking to you!
Same here.  Thanks!
have a good day.  I have to get going.
Hey how are you doing? Do you like Nintendo games?
Hi, yes I do like Nintendo games, how about you?
Yes. Did you know that the Nintendo Switch was actually founded in 1985?
I had no idea they were founded in 1889! I did not even know there were video games back then! How did they get founded?
Haha, they started as a playing card company apparently. I didn't know that! Do you know much about electricity?
That is a weird origin story. I used to love playing contra.
 Contra is great, I used to play it along with mario bros and mega man haha.
I remember playing Mega Man. I loved that game. I remember the metal gear. I still remember playingMega Man 2. I really loved thatGame too
There is a game called fzero that is a racing game to run on a racing games, do you know what it is?
That is good! I wonder if it was the one for the playstation?
It was pretty good.  It run at 60 fps.  That is really fast and the graphics were very simple but they were very fast.
I wonder how often they switch it up. I like games that way, do you play them often?
I played Zelda, Mario Party its awesome, I have many friends that are player Mario party a lot, its my favorite game, what about you?
i was a huge gamer in my college, I dont really play anymore, the last game I played was modern warfare, Call of Duty when I was in college,
I never played call of duty.  I did play with legos when I was a kid.  Did you ever play with Legos?
I did, but I was a parent, so I didn't play it.  I didn's step in it to help me out, though.
Haha yes I did. Apparently Nintendo made knock offs of legos early on too, I think they started to make toys with them, I like real legos personally, and apparently Nintendo made Knock Offs before they startedToons.
I hate that I'm not a parent, it hurts me to find out that my parent does that.  I need to step in and help them out, it really hurts.
Haha, you've stepped on Lego. It hurt! Speaking of videogames, the US government bought 1M to build a supercomputer apparently. They buy and build a Supercomputer apparently!
I never knew that.  I heard Nintendo used to own the seatle Mariners.  Never knew that!
Wow, I didn't know that.  They also released a handheld specifically for the Pokemon game.  The Pokemon game was very successful.
Are you a fan of Nintendo?
I am! I have had a few of them. How about you?
Yes I am. Super Mario is my favroite game. Nintendo started as a playing card company, but now they are a playing Card company.
I loved super mario when I was growing up.  I didn't know that fact.  That is interesting.
Do you like the seatle Mariners?
I wasn't aware of that, I think that is interesting as well. I did know that the phrase "donkey kong" was trademarked by Nintendo in Donkey Kong and not Nintendo.
That's smart.  A trademark on such a popular phrase.  They could trademark it all the time.  All my friends use it all of the time, I wonder if it's a popularphrase.
I've heard that phrased a little different but I think it was trademarked. I think a lot of us do.
Nintendo even made a lego knock off, one of those things I havent even realized they do, have you seen that one?
I never realized that, that is cool. I think it is cool how they do things like that. They really have become small niche businesses that are doing things that no one realized before.
It is also the most profitable company in Japan, the second most profitableCompany in the US and the second-most profitable company
Wow.  Nintendo does not have a large cash reserve.  If you lose all that money and go bankrupt as long as you have been around, Nintendo will have to lose it all.  I wonder how they would get it all together again if they went bankrupt and had to lose so much money?
Yeah, I think it was valued at $104 billion in 2014.
That's insane. I didn't realize they produced Pokemon too. Did you realize they've produced Pokemon since 1998?
Pokemongo is the best!
I can't believe some people get so addicted to it in the first place.
I did not use it at all. I think it was a fun thing to do with my friends though.
Are you active in it?
It encourages walking quite a bit. And you will enjoy the time.
It is a positive thing for sure, video games encourage being sedentary and staying indoors.
Very true. It was nice chatting with you. Have a good night!
Good morning!  Are you a fan of disney?
I love the franchise, I can't believe the company got founded back in 1923, that is almost 100 years of magic!
Walt and Roy Disney definitely knew what they were doing back in the day.
I bet they did, their creation of Mickey Mouse and his friends, changed our culture forever, I bet they are still friends.
Yes! I think the mouse had a profound effect, it was so funny, so funny!
It really has!  I like the character Disney has created with the princess, the Princess.
Minnie Mouse?  Did you know that Minnie is short for something?
Is Minnie a short for something else?
Minerva Mouse. Minnie suits up as Minerva Mouse.
I prefer Minnie Mouse a lot better, I think.
Me too, I like her and Big Hero 6, do you like her ?
I did, the movie was great, a great cool fact about the movie is that there is a 55,000 core super computer in it,
I thought it was great! Very good I am not surprised that it was so good it took a super computer but that is impressive for a supercomputer.
It is impressive, it is a powerful machine, Bill Nye has a very powerful machine.
Yes, the science guy! He is the founder of the planetary society right?
Yeah, he was the science consultant for the movie "Flubber" and also the science Consultant for the "A" movie.
I guess with him being a consult they added some authenticity to the movie. I don't know if Flubber is still a best of but I liked it, I haven't seen it.
I think Chris Pratt has been on many people's TV show so yeah!
I like him, I have seen a couple of movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, Jurassic Park, and a coupleof movies likeGuardians of the galaxy 2
I thought he was a great actor, he seems younger than the year, I was born in the year 1977 but I thought he must be younger than that, he is only 25
I thought he was younger too.  I learned recently he was discovered while waiting tables in Maui!  It's cool he was able to get discovered while wait tables.  That's very cool.  It was nice chatting with you!  I'm going to go do some more waiting tables. I'll see you later.  Have a great day!
Do you think we should be guardians of the galaxy?
No i haven't seen it. Is it good? I thought it was good.
No, I haven't seen it. James Gunn was not rehired, did he?
I think it was because of tweets he had made years ago, the studio had a bad publicity or law suits against the studio, and bad publicity is bad publicity.
I think so. He did make inappropriate jokes, too.
It was sexist and homophobic in nature.  In today's climate, it's easy to just claim offense if you claim offense.
I do not think the firing was fair, but he apologized on the spot and he said that he sorry, so I think it was all right.
I don't think it's fair.  I think it was a few years ago and people are so easily offended and are not always held accountable for things they say.  His life was taken from him too many years ago to be held accountable.
I agree.  It's odd that something that happened several years ago was still being posted on social media.. and then pro-Trumpers found it so odd that it happened several months later.  I'm sure pro- Trumpers found something to like on social Media.
It does, if this part is true it does seem odd and makes you wonder if the movies did a good job, if they did, how would it even be possible to commit an actual crime if this second part isTrue, but I'm not sure, movies don't usually commit an actually crime.
I don't know.  I think he was in the Marvel movie "Guardians of the Galaxy"
I have seen Iron Man and Thor and Captain America.
I don't follow the marvel series too closely because I like parks and rec, but I do like the show, and Chris Pratt plays a role in it.
I have not. I have seen Jurassic Park and thought it was good. I like Jurassic Park
Jurassic Park was the lastest one I saw him in, it was pretty good, but I haven't seen the last one.
I saw it a year ago, did you?
It's been a few months. The game has a couple guardians movies out now, and a couple new ones in the next few months too.
I think I have seen all of them.  I haven't seen the new one.
I havent, i watched the first two parts,  but I think i watched them all with a raccoon in them lol,  I cant say I like them all,  lol
yeah, that is cute and fun I guess. I like Disney things. There is a whole subculture dedicated to finding the hidden mickey mouse images from each movie.
haha I didnt know that, I would imagine there are all sorts of other places, I wonder if there is in every park they put it in, I know they do it in some places
Hey, how's it going? Did you like the Guardians of the Galaxy movie? Chris Pratt said he wanted to rehire the director James Gunn, but that Chris Pratt is too funny!
I don't like Chris Pratt much, but I do like James Gunn.  I don't have any thoughts on Pratt.  What are your thoughts onpratt?  I think that the Guardians of the Galaxy 2 will pack more cgi in the new Guardians of The Galaxy.
Yeah I like Chris Pratt a lot, he is funny, he was the waiter at Bubba Gump Shrimp, he also was in the movie LOL, I also like Chris pratt a lot and also he was a waiter at bubba gump shrimp, I liked that movie lol
Yeah, that's a real success story.  Working at a van and waiting tables and getting scouted by a director, working for a living as a hollywood star before becoming a director.  He's scouted out to be a Hollywood star!
Yeah absolutely, back to what he essentially was lol, I think it's cool that he told Steven Spielberg that he was going to do Jurassic Park, and Spielberg said he was not going to go back.  I wonder what the first Jurassic Park would have been like, I wonder.
True, it is cool he stole his starlord costumes from the galaxy set.  He was hit with a hit to the head and had to wear them all.  Did you know he went to visit sick hospital kids and kids with kids who are guardians?  I'm assuming it was the film's guardians.
Nice of him.  It's sunny in Philadelphia right now!  Did you know Glenn Howerton used to star as the lead in Jurassic World and now he's the star of The Last Tycoon?
That's weird. He lost out on those roles to Chris Pratt too. He actually libbed his Mary Poppins line in Guardians of the Galaxy and lost. I wonder if he also libbed the "MARY POPPINS LINE" line in guardians?
I did not know that, very interesting. Chris Pratt has a lot of really good movies like Moneyball, I like him a lot and he has also been in some good movies.
Yep.  Forget about Parks and Recreation, he is the leading man in the upcoming sequel.  The Lego Movie has already received 8 award nominations and he has received three for his role in the forthcoming sequel.
Youre right Parks and Recreation is awesome! I like the new Disney movie Wall-E. Have you seen it? I like Disney movies.
I love Disney movies, in fact I think Wall-E was named by Pixar as a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney.
That is very cool! I like the movie Big Hero 6 as well. It took a super computer in order to render all of the images in the movie.
I haven't seen it.  Interesting.  Are you a fan of Bill Nye?  Surprisingly, he served as a science consultant for Disney on Flubber!  He actually served as the science consultant on that.
That is surprising!  Wonder how unrealistic that movie is lol,  I mean Minerva Mouse real name is Minnie Mouse real and that is how unrealistic it is.
Really? I never knew that! That's pretty cool! I wonder if that's real? I also didn't know that there was a sub culture dedicated to finding the "Hidden Mickey Mouse images" in all things Disney. There's even a group of people that look for hidden Mickey Mouseimages on people's cars that are real.
Yep thats really cool lol. Speaking of old movies, Vin Diesel said that Groot had a secret script for the first one, he was going to say something about Vin Diesel and not Groot, I wonder if it was in the secret script?
Speaking of Groot, I wonder what he is called? I think he is just a little back in the day and used to tell tales to astonish us. Speaking of Grootin, did you see his first appearance in the 70s?
That's a long time ago.  The chinese are like the guardians of the galaxy and the interplanetary unusual attack team lol.
I did not know that!  I read the full letter of support for James Gunn and his full support for Pratt posted on Instagram.  I think it was signed by all the cast and voicing the characters.  Did you know that Pratt posted a letter of love and support for Gunn?  I am sad to see that he is now age 55, but it was sad when the cast said they would be firing that Pratt.
I did, I was shocked at how many people signed the letter, I would have to be extra careful too!  He had homophobic posts too and had to apologize and I know people signed it, I am shocked by it.
 Disney is the worlds largest independent media conglomerate.
I do, I really like the Disney company, I think I have been rewatching all the Disney stuff from my childhood in the last year or two, it has been years since I have seen any Disney stuff in the years I have not been to Disney.
Yea, the Disney brothers founded it in 1923. It's been around for so long!
Who would have thought a company that established as an animation leader would grow into such a conglomerate.
Yea, Disney grew from being an animation studio to having theme parks, and even a live-action film/tv studio.
That's cool.  I loved the movie Wall-e.  Did not realize until recently that it was named as a tribute to Walter Elias Disney.
Yes, I had no clue either. I also had no idea that Minnie was short for Minerva Mouse.
I didn't know that, either.  I didn't like it, but I didn's fancy it.  No, I didn' know that either. I was always a big fan of Dr. Suess growing up and even read Dr.Suess growingup.  A lot has been accomplished by Dr. suess.  He's done films, television series,Broadway musical, books, specials, films, TV specials, and more.
Yea, Dr. Seuss accomplished more than most of his classmates who were voted not to succeed by their classmates!
I never knew that!  He became a doctor too.
That's pretty cool, I thought he was just a college humor magazine.  I wonder if he got caught drinking with his pen and had to write about it in the magazine, or was he caught drinking and used the pen?
I wonder if he got anything for receiving a DPhD from Dartmouth, or if that is part of the honorary Phd from Dartmouth that he got?
That's pretty cool.  Well deserved since he is a nerd.  I think he deserved it.  The word "nerd" is not coming from the word "neat."
Haha, yup. Have you seen Spy Kids? I've only seen a few movies, but I know a lot of them on Rotten Tomatoes, the site that gives a lot more than 100% on movies
I tend to avoid rotten tomatoes because it is owned by Warner Bros, which means they have a conflict of interest because they are both owned byWarner Bros, so there is a conflict.
yup, I do a lot of the movies that I see on there, I give it very little ratings since Netflix owns a lot. I wonder if I would get a rating from Rotten Tomatoes, I know Netflix has almost 150 movies with 100% ratings since netflix.
Rotten Tomatoes has a really bad video game movies though, I wonder if they have rotten tomatoes for the really bad Video Game movies that they have
That's crazy, undergrads would give more love to video games!  The company launched in 1994 when it was just a company launched.
You would think so too. Michael bay has the best average film rating at 100% for the average film
I did not know that his average was so surprising, I think his movies are much better than that average!
Nice talking to you!  Thanks.
hey did you know that Minnie Mouse's name is short for Minerva? I guess that means she is the mouse that appears in Disney movies!
I'm a Disney fan, I'm a mother, it's amazing how big they have grown over the years, my son is 10 years old already and my mother is 90 years old.
Yeah, I know right, it's insane that it was founded back in 1923, and to think it has been around for almost 100 years now and approaching 100 in 2019, that is insane to think about,
I know right!  It was established right before the animation industry was even established.  It has been the leader in the animation of the disney movie.
I agree. What is your favorite Disney movie? I liked beast and The Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.
That is one of my favorites.  I don't watch them often, but I've watched them a few.  They weigh down my favorite movies.  Imagine what would have happened if this happened if I watched the local local Disney channel instead of the Disney channel.  The firing of Walt Disney was a good one I bet, but selecting movies that showed him how creative he was is one that I think showed how good he was at selecting his favorites.
I guess that's what he did!  I like the movie Big Hero 6.  It took a 55,000 core supercomputer to render it.  I wonder how they got that one?
No, I haven't seen it yet, but I know it's pretty awesome. I wonder why it's not shown on the Disney channel, since the channel only shows Disney content and doesn't have adds for non-disney shows or products. Did you know that Disney channel only has adds for Disney content?
I never knew that. I think it's realistic though haha. I also didn't know that Bill Nye is a science consultant for the Disney movie Flubber, I didn't think he was that realistic though! I didn' know he was the science consultant on the Disney Movie Flubbers!
Yes, that is not very realistic. There is a collaborative film by Disney and Salvator Dali called "Destino" that is realistic, but I don't know if it has realism.
No I didn't see that one. I liked Salvador Dali a lot! I guess there is a subculture of "hidden mickey movies" he was born on a birthday haha. So I guess he was the first born on his birthday haha
Yeah, I haven't seen that one. I've seen the Lion King cartoon with the big stink years ago, where he painted amonst the stars and the word "sex" was painted. That was a big stink Years ago!
haha ya I guess that was just a tip to Walter Elias Disney, I guess he got a $25k tip for that, and I think he did it for the Lion King, did you ever see the movie Wall-E? I think it was ok, I liked it, but not the Lion king haha
I have! It was a nice flick. I gid a nod to a children's icon. I am a fan of Dr. Seuss and a fan for that.
I am! I guess he is my favorite, I like his political stuff, I guess I just need a break from kids books because I am an adult haha, he knew so much about World War II, and political stuff that's for sure!
I did not either, he was a bit a colorful character.  I think in today's climate with a cat on the horizon of being elected president, there would be quite a bit of hat on the candidate to get elected president.  The cat is a bit the "out" of the hat, in todays climate.
ya it is shocking that he was voted out of high school, that is how they succeed apparently haha, I wonder if he voted for anyone in high school
I bet nobody forsaw him at his current level of notoriety. Theis no way he would be studying at Dartmouth with the amount of notoriety he has, and with the fortune telling prowess he has. I bet he could get a job at Disney, or maybe even Disney.
I don't think they foresaw that at all.  He got his honorary phd, and started on the doctor part.  I think he is getting the doctor's part soon.
I wonder if the word "voice" comes from a rhyme or is actually just pronounced the way it looks in his voice.
Interesting, I never knew that. He seemed unpredictable and very unpredictable. Apparently he was afraid of children. I wonder how he felt about that?
Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;)
Hi there, I do like Disney, do you?
Nope, not anymore, I think they destroyed star wars, they really destroyed it.
Lol that's funny!  Star Wars land is going to be coming in the theme park soon,  I wonder if it will be Star Wars Land or a new theme park.
I understand what true devoted fans want. It's disappointing that huge studio has done nothing with the movie.
That is so sad.  I would prefer something more like the first one.
Probably the legendary Luke Skywalker, portrayed well by him.
I would definitely not.  Fun fact, Rotten Tomatoes is owned by Disney.  Rotten tomatoes is owned since 1998.
I did not know that! I wonder why they bought it from Warner Brothers?
 Warner Bros. owned it since 1998. I think that is why it has an effect on the reviews, but not sure if they owned it or not.
I think it does, I think they have more titles so there is more pressure on the titles.
It is nice that Netflix has 150 movies that have a perfect rating on rotten tomatoes and over 100 movies have a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes!
That is quite an achievement.  I remember 2-3 years ago when you'd see a movie on Netflix and you didn't have time to catch up with the shows and movies.  It's not happening that often now.  Netflix is doing a great job, but there is still time to caught up.
I think it was pretty amazing movie selection!  It was a pretty amazing movies.
Yup, I watched with pleasure with famous actors, but some crappy movies too.  It was good to see what the future of television will be like.  Good news and crappy movies.
I wonder if they named it Rotten Tomatoes?  I don't know, I don's people used to throw tomatoes on stage, and they named It Rotten tomatoes onStage.
I did not know that.  Good for them.  I hope they can stay as independent as they are.
I guess that depends on Warner Bros....
dammit, I can't trust them. LOL, I would start a company if I feel the need to. I'm not sure that it would be good enough for them. I would probably start a new company though.
I would love to be paid to watch movies and give reviews.
I would do the job until the day I was born, then I'd be born again.
LOL  Good chatting!
Hi there.  Did you ever like Dr. Seuss books as a kid?  I remember some of his favorites from when I was in school and it was school, and I still have some old Dr. S. Seus books.
Yeah, I really enjoyed all of the Disney updated versions of the classic books and films as well as the classicbooks.
I didn't realize until recently that Disney does the Dr. Seuss stuff.  I think I voted for him in HS and he was voted by the class to succeed.
Yeah, I'm surprised by that. The universe of suesse is soo predictable, and I do not like unpredictability. I learned that the universe of Suesse was afraid of children, and that surprised him.
I did not know that!  The Lorax was a good movie,  a good Seuss movie.  It was better than "The Grinch"  or "The Good Grinch",  which were good.
I like Disney suesse remakes, I have never seen any of the produced works, but I heard Disney slips images of Mickey Mouse into some of their disney suesse Remakes.
Honestly I bet they are in some of the ones we have already seen. I heard lots of claims of the stuff. The Walt Disney Company has tons of hidden images in the fun. I've heard lots.
Yes, you're right.  Minnie is a Disney character and her name is short for Minerva, which is the last Disney character.
I didn't know that.  I did know that Disney would depict females as having names like Minerva.  The first cartoon to have a lynx named "Prince" was the one where he had a lynX named "Minnie" and she was falling in love with him.
Well, I don't think I would count him out. Snow White was a mighty fine one, but she had a thing for Da-Doo!  I have been to the Disney theme parks, so I can see where it would count.
Yes, I've seen pictures of him in old cartoons and the guy that wears his costume has huge muscles!  I know the little guy was the first drew of disney dopey in the cartoons, but I wonder if there are fans that still look for references..  lol  The guy that wore his costume, is the first drawing they drew of Disney dopey.  I wonder what other references. lol
I wonder if that's the same guy that was in Flubber.  I liked that movie.  He was ripped too, but on steroids.  Bill Nye "the science guy" was the science consultant for Disney.  Did you know that he tried to synthesize the protein that is used to synthesized steroids?  I don't think he could do it in a lab coat.  That's why he is the science Consultant for Disney!
I like Bill Nye the science guy.  I loved that show as a kid.  It was on Disney and I loved it.  Did you ever see it on Disney?
I was a nerd, but he made me proud. I ran the zoo. I think that is the term for being a nerd. I read a Dr. Suess book and it made me Proud.
Wow, no, I had no idea Seuss was such a nerd. I did have a nifty one that all the eggs were green. I wonder if he had any idea Seussian was a nerd?
Yeah, good to know!  I didn't know he was the first doctor until Dartmouth's Dr. Theodore Geissel made him one in 1936.  He made out like a doctor, and was the only scientist to do so.  I wonder if theodor geissel, the scientist who was making genetically engineered poultry is also the only doctor who was an honorary doctor in Dr. Seuss's days?  I think Dr. Suess stowed away his doctorate in his stowed up in his room and made a new one in his day of making genetically engineer poultry.
I wonder how many people have had to work in so many jobs throughout their lifetime? There are a good handful of great companies that have given people jobs over their lifetime.
I bet.  I know there are a few Dr Seuss stories usually fair pretty well, but if I remember correctly, one of them is the one with the rotten tomatoes.  Rotten Tomatoes, if I can remember correctly.
I think they have a few rotten tomatoes, but they are pretty entertaining.  I remember when I was in DC the first time, it was the place I went to visit and I think I remember seeing a Rotten Tomatoes in the place.
Are you a fan of Michael Bay's films?  I'm not a fan, but I am a fan.  Mike has an average film score of 93%, but I'm prepared for anything because he's got an average of a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.
Oh my gosh, I didn't know that.  I lean towards Disney, but I think they are more opinionated than he is.  Rotten Tomatoes is just a way for them to say what they are going for, I think.
Hi, how are you doing?
I'm good!  How are you?  I like superhero movies and have been for a long time.  I liked a portion of Iron Man, but I didn't think he did a good job in the first one.  Did you like it?
I'm doing well. I feel like there are so many super hero movies coming out that I'm not sure if I will enjoy them all. I do like all of the new movies coming though.
I do, I watch them sometimes. I haven't watched any of the last installments of the Frank Miller Batman franchise, though.
Nice, I like superhero movies, so I enjoy those as well.
I like sci fi, horror, and some sci fi.
I enjoy sci fi and horror, but I also like comedies and some comedies. When I have a cocktail, I like to stay home and watch the movies. Sometimes I go to the theaters and watch them too.
I don't go to the theater much, I live about 40 miles from the nearest town big enough to have a theater and the nearest Town Big enough for a few miles is about 30 miles. I usually buy dvds or stream. Rent. Do you buy ddds orStream?
I stream it from Netflix, I watch it mostly on my tv. What's your favorite horror movie you like to watch?
I have trouble thinking of one to be honest with you.  I watched Stephen King's Cell recently.  As long as I can see it, I like it.   I guess alien counts as horror, but I have trouble seeing how long that would take to get through.
I haven't seen that one either. Sounds like something I would prefer to see in my spare time. Are you a movie fan, or a TV fan?
I live in a rural tract on a half wooded ravine in a half rural tract and I spend a lot of time building raised garden beds and edible landscaping in our half wooding ravine. I spend most of my time building raise garden beds for my own edible landscape.
That sounds really cool! I do that when I have free time, I teach a course at my father's university and I teach for a year, so I have a full time job, but I do some fun stuff in my free time like going to the gym at 4:30 in the morning, sounds really fun! Do you have a job or a fulltime job?
That sounds like an incredible workload.  I teach and I have kids too.  LOL  I have 2 kids too,  but I have never had to teach before.  lol
My kids are great!  I teach technology in sport, fun, and how to teach technology.  Kids are great for that.
Interesting combination of subjects.
Yeah, I read a lot about it too, I like to research it and do research about it, it's tough because technology keeps on evolving in sport, so its tough to keep up.
I love opportunities to put things in from angles that weren't examined much previously.
I love this job I get to grow my own gardens.
I have a lot of fruit trees and berry bushes, corn, and a lot, a lot.  I also have high-value veggies like tomatoes and salad greens, and some corn.  We have a little of that every year, but not much high- value veggies.
That sounds really great. Well, it was nice chatting with you.
Did you know the Marvel movies are more than 40 years old now?
Marvel movies are a lot of fun to watch, I liked some of them, how about you?
I do love them!  The first time I watched one in the theatres, I was hooked!  It was rough like Thor but I remember I liked it.  I think Iron Man came out in the early 90's and I remember it was rough in the first time i saw it in the theatre, but I was like "I love this!"  I can't believe it was in the late 90's before iron man 2 came out and hooked everyone, even in the UK theatres!
I would have to agree with you there, Iron man was such a fun movie. I also liked Avengers: Infinity War, I didn't know that it was going to come out until Avengers: Age of Ultron, I wonder if it'll happen after Infinity War got released, that would be a fun one
I think it was early 2018, early July, I would say.  I loved it.  The end game will make it make sense.  War of the Avengers came out a month later.  Crazy to think that the end is just a month away.  Do you think the end game would make sense?
I agree with you, I liked the Infinity War movie, do you know who produced the Avengers, they produced the avengers?
I do not remember. Was it the Russo Brothers? It was made by the Russo brothers?
Yes, directed by the Russo brothers and it was produced by Marvel Studios, so the Russo Brothers are definitely behind it.
gotcha, makes more sense lol. Do you like the actor who played Jarvis? I haven't seen his films yet, I wonder if he is the same actor who play's Jarvis in all the other films
I heard about that, but I don't know much about him to be honest, I find it odd to be more honest. Did you know he has never seen any of the Iron Man films?
Paul Bettany, plays vision of "Iron Man" lol I think I will watch all the films starting with Iron Man 2.
That would make perfect sense to me! I also read somewhere recently that the Avengers: Infinity War is the first film to be shot in the entirety with the digital Imax cameras. That film is the Avengers 4, which I think is the last film to use them.
Wow that is awesome. I bet the effects were so awesome. Have you ever been to an IMAX theatre? I've never been to the IMAX Theatre.
I watched it in an Imax theater, and now I'm thinking I would like to see it in one more in an IMAX theater, but not sure how well it would do.
I did not see the original Thor movie but I saw End Game.  I didn't see the difference either.  Did you see that one?
I did watch Thor. Did you happen to see it?
I don't know when it came out. I think it happened in 2012?
I never knew that.  I never knew what year the Thor movie came out in, either.
lol  Yes it came out in 2012, about 10 years after Iron Man and about 20 years after the first one.  Nice chatting with you!
You too, I wonder who directed Thor?
I can't remember who it was, it's probably Kenneth Branagh, but I can't think of any other films he directed, if I remember right.
Nice chatting with you!  Have a nice one.
Enjoy your night! And watch another great Marvel classic!
Hi have you ever watched avengers: infinity war?
Yea, it's pretty crazy some theaters showed only one of the marvel films
Wow, yeah I think I have seen all of those movies but I'm right in the middle of binge watching the new Soiderman Homecoming LOL.  I've seen all the movies, wow.
I have seen the Incredible Hulk!
Yeah, it wasnt the greatest of all time but it was didnt bad.
I really enjoyed thor though. Kenneth Brangh did a great job with the story and I really liked how he used Kenneth Branagh.
Yeah!  Did you like the Ant Man movies?  Thor ragnarok was my favorite of the series, but I like the old Ant Man movie better.
I have seen all of them.  My favorite is James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy.  It's always a surprise how good they are.
It was good! I love that awkward guy, Drax.
Yea, the age of ultron was kinda like that too!
Yeah I didnt like how they advanced the storyline at all lol, iron mans was getting bored and rich and smart yay at the end of the last one lol, I think it was bored and smart Yay for him!
Yes, I thought Civil War was better, but I did enjoyed Ant-man and spider-mans parts more.
Civil War was good too, it involved a lot of emotional stuff and I like the acting in it, but I wasnt expecting it to have a sour ending, Civil War has a lot to do with the sour ending and it involved and involved a lots of emotional Stuff too.
Yea, Civil War did a good job of setting the stage for the next film. I like how it was shot with both digital Imax cameras and the film was the first to use them
Wow that is expensive lol, I didn't know that, that movie caused an increase in shawarma sales, I wonder if that movie cause an increase to shaw Sharma sales
I did know that lol. I'm not surprised Shawarma sales increased.  Tony Stark did a good job making it sound good.
I agree with you there, he made people who didnt know what to think, lol. I'm curious to see how it does in the new one, I'm going to have to look it up, I wonder if it's better than Loki. Did you know Tom Hiddleston was auditioning for Thor, he decided to instead go for Loki because he was curious, lol!
I had not heard that, I'm glad Hiddleston ended being casted as Loki. I didn't know he was also going to be Thor.
ya hes a good actor I think hes a perfect fit for Loki,  they make a great team,  hes a great actor and they both make aGreat team, lol I can't believe they used to be brothers lol
Yea Marvel is really good at casting characters, like casting Robert Downey Jr. for Iron Man, and they are also good at Casting Robert Downy Jr.
Yeah another perfect fit was for Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. lol
Yep, it was nice chatting with you.
Hi, how are you?
Hey there. Do you like Robert Downey, Jr.
I do. What about you?
I do like him I guess. He does a lot in Iron Man. I like the set of the war that they used to hide food in. It was weird haha. They used to do that a lot on set.
Yeah, what kind of food did he hide?  Tasty food?  I wonder who would steal it and hide that food?
Haha it woudl be different kinds of different food to be hid apparently ahah. He eats blueberries and Shawarma in the movie. I like how he eats blueberry and shawarma in that movie
What the heck is Shawarma?
haha, a middle eastern wrap with the lamb in a white sauce and then a white Sauce. It's pretty good and I like lamb.
That sounds pretty good I had no idea it caused an increase in sales, but I am hungry now, I will have to try it.
It is wild.  I think blueberry sales also increased too.  Give it a try, it should give you something to think about.
I think I hate blueberries but love blueberry muffins. Weird.
Haha, weird! I do the same thing with blueberries. I don't like the muffins, but I do like blueberry jam.
I hate blueberry jam. I like muffins. It doesn't taste like blueberries. I would rather have blueberry pancakes, or any pastry type food that doesn't even taste like Blueberries, like blueberry pancake.
I've never heard of a type of blueberry affliction before haha. I've never tried pastry without a covering of some type of Blueberry Affliction before, I wonder if that is where the blueberry taste comes from?
I drink blueberry vodka, but I don't know if it mixes well with anything else.
Hmmmm... fruity vodkas.  I typically just put Sprite in it and it's actually really tasty... but I'm not sure.  Do you typically like fruity Vodkas?
I hate that I have to buy the vodka. I fear it will be a terrible vodka. It will be one hell of a terrible, terrible vodka!
haha that is a good quesiton, haha.  If I can get it close I buy a little bit and then say hmmm maybe give it to a friend,  I'll try it LOL.  I have a friend that likes it a little less than me lol
No kidding! The whole thing is gross. I would drink too much of it. I'm sure it helps keep me hydrated but it's gross. The captains of the captains had to drink gatorade to keep them hydrated when they ran out of coke because their job was not to drink!
lol, good drinks!  I hated the first Thor films,  it was a waste.  I liked Thor Ragnarok,  but hated the new Thor Ragnarok,  not sure about the new films.
I did like it.  It's good that they are trying to give us average looking guys a shot.  Nice chatting with you.  Give us averageLooking guys a chance!
Are you a Star Wars fan?
I am!  Did you know that he played the character of Poe Dameron?
No, but I know who he was. Do you know who it was in the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens?
Yes. It is!  It was played by Oscar Isaac from the Guatemala!
nice. George Lucus wife was in the original Star Wars, she had ideas like obi wsn's death, and other ideas like that
Yeah and she even won an academy award for editing the film
Nice. James Earl Jones, the original darth Vader voice in the movie, was amazing in hte movie. He record all of the lines in only 2.5 hours, he did the voice for 3 hours!
That is insane. Did you know it was dubbed in Navajo?
Wow! I did not know that, I wonder why?
Yes, the first major movie to do so.
Yes.  There is trivia gold in the Star Wars saga.  The relationship between Luke and Darth in the Empire Strikes Back was actually fake scripts from the Empire strikes back.  They used fake scripts so they could get away with it.
Wow, I didn't know that!  I did know that 20th Century fox was convinced that the first movie was going to flop, and it did!  Fox was convinced they were going to be the one to flops!
I guess they were blinded by the fear of loss rather than potential, or they were just blinded by a fear of losing. I guess that's why George Lucas retained the rights to it.
Yeah, and it cost Fox billions and Lucas $500 000,000,000. Not much money, but money.
I had no idea that the originally written female role of Luke Skywalker was going to change the role of Lucas.
I do not know, who was it?
Yes, I hoped you would like to know more about Star Wars. It's George Lucas got some terms from NASA when putting together the list of favorite scifi movies. He hoped that they would list accurate space technology and space technology movies.
I am a huge fan of the first one, but I was wondering if you would like the second one.  I am booking Luke's boyhood home in the new one, nigh from "Nigh to the Last" in Tunisia.
I know, that's a landmark!  I gotta get back to it.  You'd have to pay the extra 20 bucks for the mit science fiction society membership, though.  That's an xpensive membership.  I wonder what you get for it?  I'd have gotta pay the $40 extra to get into the Science Fiction Society.
Nice,  that is nice of them to get involved in that.
Yeah I would like to attend a scifi convention for the first time, I have never been before. It was nice chatting with you, thanks for your time.
Hello, are you aStar Wars fan?
I think Star Wars is great, especially the original trilogy!
I've never watched all of the movies. I basically only like the first 3. But I know they made George Lucas a billionaire, so that was something.
I know, George was smart about merchandising though, he even did a song for it.
Yes, he did, he was able to accept the directing fee for the licensing and merchandising rights and did not accept the Directing fee.
I guess if it had been his chance, he would have taken the half a million, but I guess he had enough money from previous films he directed.
That paid off lol! Did you hear about how much Jame Earl Jones made for Vader's lines?
I can't imagine, but he had the perfect voice.  The budget of the film was low, so he had to be the perfect one.
Well, it was inital success, so it paid for itself, and they only paid him for 2.5 hours of work lol.
Probably more on the back end, maybe residuals from the films and such.
I hope so. I hear George Lucas's wife got awards for her editing of the movie.
Yeah, she was the one who contributed so much to the story, lots of great ideas that made the movie memorable and she contributed to the lots of Great ideas that were used in the movie.
I heard she thought the best kiss was in Obi Wan's death.
I dont think she has a lot of great ideas, but George had a lot, shaping the story, I think, and a lot more films than she did, I dont think.
I like Luke Skywalker a lot.  He's good in that movie, but he did put a little too much on him.  Did you know when he lived in Tunisia as a boy he would pay 300 dollars and stay a night at a home of a Luke Skywalker to visit Tunisia.  That would have been a good way to pay it forward.
Sounds like fun,  never mind I will have to look into that,  Im not sure Ill ever make it to Tunisia,  but I bet the true fans line up for that, I dont think Ill ever be in that line of fans,  that sounds like fun though,
lol I will, I think I might go there too!  Do you like science fiction movies?
I do like science fiction films, I like alien and aliens and such.
I loved those movies! They were scary and thrilling!  I wish NASA had kept those around.
i dont know any of the nasa films.
I'm not sure, but I like NASA in general I guess? It was nice chatting with you about NASA. Enjoy your day!
Hello,  do you like The Last Jedi?  Did you know that it is the highest grossing movie of the new millennium?
I did not know that, there was a lot of backlash to it though
Apparently fans thought it was so bad that they petitioned to remove it from canon, they petitioning to remove all of the new canon.
I agree, I thought it was horrible lol, Anon was right, I was thinking it was so bad I was like "no way, I can't agree with you", I thought that was horrible LOL, did you know Mark Hamill who plays Luke Skywalker has been thinking about quitting acting, I wonder why?
I bet he quickly found out the wrong thing and just recanted, he did not say anything more. I bet he soon found out he said the wrong things and just Recanted it.
Yep he did! Talk about multimillion-dollar movies, I wonder what star wars movies he would be starring in lol
I like the character, but I think he should be killed off, but that happened to another character.
Yep that's true. Did you know that the first Star Wars movie was going to be made back in 1977, I think it was the first one to be released?
George Lucas was a good business man he propositioned 20th century Fox for a $1 fee for the merchandising and licensing rights and he made out like a billionaire!  I wish I had made out better than the man he propositions, 20th Century Fox.
Yep, he was smart and a genius and probably a genius at the time. He did a lot of editing at the same time, which helped him out. He's definitely got some credit for that. His wife, Marcia Lucas, did a whole lot of things to help with the story though, she's a very smart wife, and she helped him with a lot too!
She does get credit for that, she even won an academy award while George Lucas did not
Yeah her idea to kill off obi-wan in the first movie was so important for her and Leia to give Luke a good luck kiss in the second one.
I think they also found out we are siblings lol, that was a factor.
Haha that is a good point. Did you ever watch Star Wars and Navajo? Apparently you can understand the language of Navajo but you can't understand the Language of Star Wars
No, I don't know the language. I guess I could watch Navajo in any language.  James Earl Jones only spent 2.5 hours recording Darth Vader's voice and was paid $7500.  I guess he got a good money for doing it.  Did you know James Earl jones only spent 3 hours recording darth Vader's Voice and was only paid $5,000!  That's how good they are at making vaders and vaders pay!
Yeah, i bet it was a lot of money to make per hour, and I bet it is so.Plus he was paid for such an iconic role.  Plus future movies are going to need a lot Of money to making per hour.
I guess it depends on what kind of royalties he got.
Yep I forgot about royalties.  I like some science fiction movies, have you ever seen the movie Gattaca?
Ive seen it, I think Ive seen that movie a time or two, I like it I think it is an accurate science fiction movie and its named after the NASA apparently, Ethan Hawke is the only one to have named a movie after NASA apparently
I have to watch that one too, its a great movie, and yes I did see that, I think it is incredibly accurate, I like that movie writers use the page of space technology terms like gattaca and that is interesting that Nasa would do that, interesting that NASA uses those page ofspace technology terms and they are incredibly accurate as well, what a great Movie!
Hahah, did you know that Luke Skywalker was written by a girl?
do you like star ward?
I have never seen that movie. What is it?
Awesome, when? When was it out?
True, do you know who played the role of Poe Dameron?
Yes that was Oscar Isaac, he is from Guatemala originally,
Yeah, he is a native of planet yarvin but it was requested that it be filmed in Guatemala because he is requested to be a native.
Yeah, Lucas' wife changed things in the script and added stuff.
Yes she won an oscar for that
Yeah she deserved it, and she also added the Princess Leia good luck kiss to it
True. Do you like science fiction movies?
I do actually. Did you know that NASA has a list of terms that writers can use?
Wow nice. A movie named gattaca is the most accurate movie of all time scientifically. It is also the most named movie of its time scientifically
Nice. There is a lifetime membership to the mit science fiction society and a lifetimemembership for only $500
Yeah you can get in there if you die. And you can come back when you die
Wow cool. And Deep Roy and now deep ry hold the science fiction trifecta
Yeah he appeared in doctor, star trek and star trek, and star wars.
Yeah. Do you know what the fan convention that he went to was? It was a fan convention
No but I hear its an extremely lucrative for the industry.
Yes.  The actors can earn up to $700,000 per weekend.
wow, that's a lot of money for sure, do you know how much salaries in movies are?
That's great they can make some extra too.
Good morning, do you like Walt Disney movies?
I love Walt Disney. One of my favorites is Sleeping Beauty. I think it's one of the best movies ever made.
I used to watch some of those growing up, I like the recycled animations, I used to have a computer that wore tennis shoes.
haha ya I liked that one, I also liked the movie Frozen, I never knew it was directed by a woman, I didn't know it was a disney movie, and it was by a man, I wish I knew that I would have seen that movie, it was the first disney Movie to be directed by woman
No I didn't know that either. You know these kinds of things don't always know. Lion king was dubbed into zulu for its release in africa.
That makes sense because Zulu is an African language.  I'm assuming they made it in the African language?  That's so interesting!  I wonder if they made any money off of it.  Toy manufacturers used to contact Disney before movies came out to contact them.  Disney makes so much money off toy toys that it's interesting to think about.
Speaking of movies, did you know that Deadpool 2 didn't make as much as the original movie? The video game cost more than the original movies did, and the video game only cost $7500 to make, while the original film and video game Cost $15,000 to make!
No I haven't played the video game. I saw the movie, but haven't seen the video. Have you seen the movie?
I did not realize that it was directed by Cameron or Lucas. That's funny. I like superhero movies. Did you realize that the first one is the highest grossing R rated film of all time and is also the highestgrossing R rating film ever for a superhero movie?
Yeah that is impressive! In the comics they alluded to Deadpool 2 being about shar-pei and how Ryan Reynolds crossed over into a role in the comics and in real life haha, I wonder if he did that or if he was just doing what he did in realLife haha.
Reynolds is pretty versatile as a voice and as the mystery villain too.
I remember the mystery villain part, I think I saw that part.  Josh Brolin, who played Cable is awesome.  He was the best part of Deadpool 2 though.
I didn't see it either, it was directed by David Leitch.
I believe he was the director. The first movie was so good that it made him want to get rid of the director, he got rid of David Fincher and James Cameron, the other director, and he made a new movie with them. He seemed to champion the project.
I think it must have affected the quality, I know Guardians of the Galaxy 2 was the best.
I did see the movie, Chris Pratt is awesome. I liked it a lot!
He is. I admire ad libbing.  I guess a line from Mary Poppins is something he ad libbed, "Bravo!"  I like the superhero genre.
That's really funny,  thats a good line!  I think I would have done that too!  That was a good one.  I would not want to pack on chris pratt with CGI abs lol I guess that turned out to be a really good line to say,  and I guess it is better than the pack on Chris Pratt with CGI abdomens lol
Yeah, who cares, it's ok! Did you know that china and taiwan renamed themselves the interplanetary unusual attack team?  Kinda odd, and a mouthful.
That is odd, I know. I don't remember if James GUNN was the director of that movie. I know that there was controversy because of a post he made on twitter before he directed the movie, but I can't remember what the controversy was. I think it was a weird post he makes, but it was the first post he's made on Twitter.
Yes, I think he is.  Thanks for the chat, it was excellent!
Self-censorship on platforms like Twitter
I'm not a big fan of it.  I've never looked at it.
I like edgy content creators like Dan Harmon who are expressive, free and not apologize for it. He exposes the fallacy of "a mob of the plain and not the expressive" on some platforms. I like edgie content creators who are willing to apologize to a mob of their own and I like that.
Yeah, that sucks!  You create whatever content you want to, it is not bad and people wont like it,  just lame and you have to create whatever you like and yeah,  it is bad andPeople will get you for that,  sucks.
I don't know what the purpose of the "downvoting" thing is.  Did you know that Deadpool 2 was rated R because a family of 10 was going to protest the theaters for not having it rated R.  They did not like the movie and sent Deadpool out on his own for the purpose.
I think its a good thing, it is free for everyone to protest, but superhero movies are a good way to protest them.
They are crossing the line, I think.  They are humiliating criminals who have committed heinous crimes and the element of shaming should not be allowed to be employed, but rather the element that is used for shaming is what's crossing the Line.  I think that is humiliating criminals, and that is not appropriate.
I think it is, but I think that they should be supporting any sort of criminal behavior like organizing a mob to riot over some sort ofcriminal behavior like free content creation.
Makes sense.  Harm has been trying to recruit time travelers to do something bad to the US and showing it to harmon.  Makes me want to see what he is doing now.
Yeah, not remotely bad at all.  I think sensitive people would see stuff like that as bad.  But I think some people would not.
Yes, and now famous people are getting worse about it and start to quit or neuter their social media. Hopefully they can reverse this trend.
I think it will continually get worse.  People are just going to be more and more mean and mean every day of the day.  There is no way to get better at anything these days.  My opinion on this is that it will just continually get better and then continually get bad.
That's sad. I know I have always felt that way. I don't like to have my opinion out there, because I don'n't want to be mobbed by everyone if I do not share on social media. It's not like I can just tell someone my opinion.
Good question, I don't know if it's a good question to say I would have an opinion or express it. I would say I'd just say I was hated on for saying it. What about you?
Hahaha, that is a good point! I wonder if it's more of a concern for the movies that are safe or if things that are too "offensive", like Toy Story, have become too offensive. Disney has gotten away with censorship and now there is less and less variety coming out of Hollywood. It plays a role in why they are getting rid of some of their movies. Like Sanranne, Toy Story is one of the most safe movies, and Disney is trying to get rid of the censorship and keep the variety coming.
Yeah I agree with you, it's funny that when you say skin color it's not attacked naturally but instead you feel it's when it's said because of Jerry Seinfeld, that's just funny,
Disney is trying to run away from that for fear of being run out of diversity.  They have things like cultural appreciation events.  But they don't want people to be offended by things like Cultural appreciation.  sigh.  Disney is the abc studio that has diversity in their professional title.  I wonder if the abt studio is trying not to be offensive to people of different color.
Good call yeah, affirmative action is a true example of "you have to get the experience to get a job so you have to be able to do the job." That's the "you need to have the mentality" mentality and be practiced in those skills to get that experience. I wish I could have practiced speech and speech skills in college to get back into my performance, I could report that as true.
I think that this period in history needs to be remembered. I think it is a critical element of the generations that we will always have. I read that it is the level of thinking that is going to be a criticalelement of the next generations.
Good call, I don't think there is much information out there today on that. I mean, not everything is recorded or photographed, but there is information out here today that we don't know about.
Very true, but to be fair to the historians and the historians, there is a lot to sift through so it is sort of a lot.  Well, it was good talking to you, to befair.
Are you a Walt Disney fan?
I like some of their stuff, mostly because my kids watch it.  I like the big six film studios and that big six.  It's hard to believe it's been around since 1923!
I agree. Did you know that Disney's Lion King was the first movie to be dubbed in Zulu for its African release?
I think that's the best way to do animated films now, they make the movie in a different way.  I like it better that Pixar make the Movie.  Star Wars is my favorite movie series.
That is correct, Disney owns Star Wars!  Disney recycled all their animation cells from a Disney movie a few years ago that resulted in almost identical scenes in the two movies that you catch in this one.  Disney's recycled their animation cell from the old movies from over 20 years ago.  I never knew that.
That's cool. They do such big budgets on their films. They are vultures for sure, especially with the "big" ones like Jungle Book. They originally wanted the Beatles to voice the jungle book.
That is interesting. Frozen was the first animated Disney movie directed by a woman and the first Disney movie to ever have a woman in it.
It doesn't surprise me.  The technology used in the older films like Bambi and other older movies is amazing!  Frozen used a special multiplane camera to make it more realistic, and the director used a director with a special multipleplane camera and a camera toMake it look more realistic.
I agree, the first director must have been really smart, he was able to recapture the vibe of the movie so I bet it will be the same director, the second one will have to be really smart though, I don't think they can do it as well as the first movie
Deadpool has been a huge hit. I am not a big fan of the X-men series, but I liked the films from the X -men series.
Yes, I liked Deadpool 1 too, but I didn't find the story of the comic book series to be very good. I thought the second one was good, but not as big as the first.
I'm not sure. Who did he say he was?
Ryan Reynolds crossed paths with shar-pei in the comic book series "The Deadpool" which led to ryan believing he was destined to play that role. This led to him being cast in Deadpool 2.
That is too funny, I wonder how Deadpool made it in the movies, he had that vision for a few years before the first Deadpool made came out.
I righ know, it was so righ!
Did you see Deadpool 2?  I saw the Matt Damon cameo appearance.  I didn't think it was worth it, but I did like it.
lol  The Deadpool video game cost $300,000 to make.  I wonder how much the Deadpool movie will cost.  lol
Wow, that is amazing.  Cross promotion and the big bucks!  In any case, in this case, the big idea of having a movie spent more on entertainment was a good idea since they spent so much on the cross promotion.  I suppose that's why it reached the #1 billboard chart in 2014.  The guardians of the galaxy soundtrack reached #1 in the billboard entertainment chart.
That was a huge movie. I enjoyed chatting with you!
Take care!  Take care!
Have a good day.  I will.
do you like Deadpool?  Do you like him?
I've seen the first one.  I liked it.  Have you seen the second one?
No but I guess Reynolds is a main character in a novel that is supposed to be similar to the main character, so I guess he would be one of the voices that are similar to them
He is a talented guy.
Yes he is.  Funny, the lion king was dubbed to zulu for it's release in africa.  The lion king is not the first to be dubbed to Zulu.
I did not know that but it makes sense. Disney does a good job marketing its movies to new audiences.
They make money off of film production and that is how the toy industry gets involved.  The toy industry is always looking to make money.
I mean, it is like a marketing campaign, the first step in the brand being able to life in a film, a step that helps the brand in a marketingcampaign.
Yes.  They even libbed Mary Poppins line "You're the guardians of a new galaxy."
No, I haven't seen that film.  That's funny.  I like Chris Whatshis.
No, it is not.  James GUNN wanted to use pratt and a fake six-pack in the cgi to give him a fakeSix-pack.  Too bad he did not.
Man, I love him so much!  That fake six pack!  He is great in that!  I wonder if he got in trouble for it in real life?  James Gunn the guy, man he is just great in everything he does!  Disney is just like James Gunn and they will do anything for Disney!
I have no idea.  I know he was in Rick and Morty.
It is an animated show.  Isnt it about a kid who is a scientist who becomes an animated Show?  Lots of potty mouth and surreal plots.
It was, not to mention that the creation of the show was created by a guy named Dan Harmon.  I guess there was some controversy about the creation, but I guess he did what he was told and Gunn did what was created.
Controversy is good for a filmmaker. It draws attention, sells films. Gotg probalby thinks that it sells films, but I'm not sure.
Gunn kind of did, tweeting jokes about things like rape and pedophilia, that was funny.  I don't like his tweeting jokes.
I guess he crossed the line. He is a good director. He should be reined in.  Some people make jokes and dont realize it.  I guess he's crossed the LINE.  He must be a gooddirector, but some people make joke and dont realizing that.
I think he is. I know he worked with his former employer, Harm, to get him comfortable about edgy topics. It's easier when you're an employer and you have something easier to do.
Well lesson learned.  I think I'll go watch my tweets now.  Thanks for the great chat and I wonder why he was chosen to direct one of Gotg's films.  Maybe he can watch my Twitter and watch the films instead.
I have trouble with tweets too!
Hello,  have you seen the new avengers 2 movie?
I havnt seen the avengers yet, but my son love movies, so I might see it.
Nice! The movie was the first to be filmed with digital imax cameras and I think it was the only movie ever to do that.
Did you know the avengers caused a notable increase in shawarma sales?
Nice, that is pretty cool. Do you know the guy who plays Jarvis in Iron Man and Avengers?
I heard that, I have not seen the films, I wonder why?
Yeah, he just isn't that type. Lou Ferrigno is his type. I think he did it for good reason though.
Yeah I do know him, I think he did voice the Hulk back in the day.
Yeah, he's peaking right now. I also like Serena Williams, I think she's the vice. Do you watch tennis? I like celebrities like her and Serena williams.
I do like Serena Williams, I dont really wathc tennis, do you?
Nice! She is the only one to have won every grand slam while she was pregnant, she even won one while she wasn't pregnant!
That is amazing. She is a good role model for young girls.
Yes, and she is also a business woman and co-owns Miami Dolphins.
That is a pretty sound investment, good for her.
Did you know that she speaks 5 different languages fluently and so does her sister Venus?  I wonder if she speaks more than us?
I wonder how they learned all those languages? isnt that something we have in common with all of us? how did they all learned those 3 languages?
Yeah, she is a well rounded person i guess. She reached number 1 on the ranking once, so she is definitely a well well rounded people.
Yes that was July 11, 1991
Yeah, I looked it up and it looked like that was actually number 2 in 2 weeks.
I heard that she has been number one for the sixth time at number 1.  She held that for 11 consecutive weeks, but her competitor has been the competitor for the last five, and for the six consecutive weeks.
Yeah, I think I would give anything to be ranked anywhere near where she is now. She even beat Sharapova and win the Australian Open in the first place when she was ranked 123rd, she did beat Sharapo and win it.
That is amazing.  I dont know how any other athlete can do what she does.
No it would be pretty difficult to fill her shoes.
Hello, do you like the Avengers?
I have not seen them yet. I do like marvel movies though. They did a good job on the first one.
I have and I love them too! Marvel is awesome! I can't count all the heros out of a sequel huh! They are going to have a sequel? I wonder if it will be a sequel to "Love & Rockets" I don't think it will count as a sequel though.
It is amazing how many things they have done.  They have made so many actors into superstars and do so many different things.
The Avengers is definitely an era and so is Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of The Galaxy 2, and Guardians of a Galaxy 3.
The age of ultron, and I love the tie ins too, like Lou Ferrigno being included.
I was disappointed that he didn't play in that role, he was the Hulk and I liked him in that roles. I didn't like him in the Hulk at all.
I heard that they had Loki pretending to be the Hulk in the setting of the movie which is an amazing twist.
Crazy, right!  It was shot with digital imax cameras!
I did not know that, but it makes sense since they are just starting to release more of the trasitioning in the imax now. Imax is a great movie and it was a great one, so it makessense
I will have to watch it and see if the guy who plays Jarvis is in it, I think I like him.
He does an amazing job with the character and is able to change his performace by critiquing the way they are doing things, he really gets to know his character and do an amazingJob
I wouldnt be able to resist, wouldnt you? Do you like Scarlett Johansson ?
I know what you're talking about.  I really liked the Black Widow movie.  We are going to have to see it again.  Hope they can make it an amazing origin movie.
I hope no Kardashians in it lol.
I understand they are famous, but I don't want any reality tv garbage. I will have to rewatch Avengers Infinity War to understand it all!
I know, I don't either. It's like they latched on to Paris Hilton and spun her into something else. They are full of drama and they are all just latched onto Paris Hilton.
Yes, it is ridiculous.The whole trailblazer in selfie things makes me roll my eyes so hard.  She's so selfish and not a good title for someone who is just trying to be a trailblazing in selfieThings.  I just can't get behind her.  It's just so selfish.
Haha, agreed! It was appropriately titled Selfish!
I wonder when pop culture phenomenon fades away.
ya I agree, it's been nice talking to you have aGood night,  nice talking with you!
You too, good conversation.
Hi there! How are you doing on this fine internet day?
I am good, how about you?
Im doing great, thanks for asking, do you follow tennis?
I do actually. Did you know that there are two tennis players that are more known as Williams sisters?
I watch a little tennis, but I don't watch much tennis myself. I thought it was funny that Serena and Venus were ranked #1 and #2 and then Karsten Braasch, ranked #3, who is the man who was ranked even worse than them, accepted a challenge from them to beat them, thought it would be a better game of tennis. It is funny that they easily beat him, but it took work to work up the confidence to do so. It was a challenge.
Lol that is kind of funny, I can see how they had confidence in themselves though, they are both really good at it lol
I would put their money in their mouths!  The Williams sisters speak french and Italian.  Amazing.  They have tutors who can help them.  Williams sistersspeak french and italian.
I dont quote them, but I remember that her dad was in the military and they were stationed overseas for most of their lives, I think, I know her dad is still stationed overseas but I dont know.
That would make sense, I think they would pick up a different language on the court there. Serena Williams was ranked No. 95 when she win the Australian Open against Sharapova. She rose so quickly, she was the first woman to win theAustralian Open against her. I think that was in 1997, I don't know if Serena williams was ranked that high in her country or not, but she was a very good pick.
Yeah, Venus was kind of in her sisters shadow for the whole career. Serena was always in there. Venus was pretty good too, but Serena got away from her and got out of her sisters's shadow. During the Open era among female players, a total of 14 players have been ranked number 1 or 2 in the total number of the Open Era among female.
Serena Williams is a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins, I always wondered why that would be. I wonder if it's because of prize money or if it was a smart investment, she is the co- owner and gets to keep some of the prize money.
I dont know,  I dont even know what that means,  but I know that the NFL is making a lot of money,  and I think buying a whole team like the Dolphins is a smart investment.  I wonder if she would have picked a team that she would like lol
Well, they are based in Miami and they have ties to the owners, so I think it might be possible for the owners to add a few more teams that have ties, and I dunno.  I think there are more opportunities.
I doubt she could buy a part of one of the 32 NFL team owners.  That would make sense for most of the teams to want to sell shares, but if that is the case, they would have to get part of the money from the Kardashians.  But I don't know how professional sports are, so I doubt that would make any sense for any NFL team owner, but I think they would probably sell shares if they could.
I was thinking the same. I wonder if the Kardashians have any NFL ownership. I mean, I know they are irritating to fans. They show up incessantly. What kind of poeple do you have to follow to follow what kind ofpoeple you have and what kind to do about it.
I dont understand the fascination with them either, i doe, but i hate that they always rolling with it. i really dont understand it either.
The williams sisters got fame and money because of their work and talent.  Kim Kardashian is different.  She has her work and Talent.
She was a personal assistant to Paris Hilton for a while. I guess she married a couple rappers, but they must be mad at her for running off with her own. She is not deserving.
I don't think that people get money for doing what they do with life. I think that some people are lucky to be born into rich families, and then some people don't. Well, I enjoyed chatting!
Yeah I agree with you, it is crazy that a reality TV star can actually make $75 million dollars and a reality tv star can only make $10 million dollars!  Well I'm gonna go now, ttyl!
TTYL.  TTYL!
bye! :) :D :D
hey there, what do you think about Kim Kardashian?
Hello, I heard she did a lot of her own work on those Yeezys.
Cool, I never knew that. She and Paris Hilton were friends. Paris's assistant and stylist.
That is cool. Did you ever see avengers: Infinity War?
No. I heard it was good but I haven't seen it. Have you?
It is a film that is distributed by Walt Disney Studios. It is a new film that uses the Marvel Comics superhero team the avengers from the age of ultron. Marvel Studios is a subsidiary of Marvel Comics, which is also distributed by Disney Studios
Wow, I haven't seen any of those movies for awhile, I heard that the first person to do the voice of Hulk in the series is actually a guy who has been doing it for awhile.
That is so cool. I did hear that Hugin and Munin Raven, Odin Raven, were in the Avengers film during Thor and Loki's argument on a mountaintop. I would like to see a Loki T-shirt from that film.
Cool, I have that awesome t-shirt, I did not know that, Avengers: Infinity War is the first film to be shot with Imax cameras, and that is why it was shot with imax cameras.
That is funny, a green t-shirt!  The green one would be spectacular for sure!  Did you see the film that had the guardians of the galaxy attempt to stop Thanos from amassing the all-powerful 3 stones?  The avengers of the guardians from another galaxy attempt.  That would be a spectacular green tshirt!
That does sound great! I've heard kids talk about Thanos a lot and pretend to be him on the show recess. I think one voiced Gretchen in recess, she voiced Grethen in the show, and she and the other kids talkAbout Thanos and their gauntlet or whatnot.
I haven't seen it either, I'm sure it's ok.  I hear that Robert Downey Jr. used to hide food at his cousin's house when he sets up the Avengers set.  He would hide food all over the set.
Haha I wonder what he was hiding food for.
I don't know.  I would continue to try to find it, but I'm not sure if I could find it.  Apparently, part of the reason he hid them was because the scenes with him eating blueberries and shawarma are unscripted.  He hid them because that character's character wants to make a video game collection of food.  So he wants to be able to eat whatever he wants while he's eating blue berries.  That's why he's doing this.
Hilarious, he seems like a cool guy.
Robert Downey Jr. is one of the best.  Did you know that Hollywood uses a measurement called "likes" scores to determine the likability of celebrities?
I had no idea that was even a thing. I think it's kind of ridiculous. Speaking of celeberties, did you know that Fall Outboy had Kim Kardashian in a music video? The whole idea of having Kim in amusic video.
That is one way to score.  Hollywood is so popular that their score is the lowest ever on the    Rotten Tomatoes.
Wow! I guess many people don't like her.
I think it has something to do with her reality tv personality attitude.
True, her show is crazy. Well it was nice talking to you, I need to go to bed now, this show is Crazy. Goodbye.
Marvel comics creation, superhero films.  The Avengers is the first Marvel Comics creation, but it's also the most known.
I am, they are my favorites. Avengers caused a increase in shawarma Sales, I believe.
I ware not sure what that is.  I saw the latest one though.
I have and it is good. It is suspenseful and I was wondering what would turn out to be the ending but it was very suspenseful. Marvel comics never ceases to amaze me. It explains how realistic the film is shot using digital imax cameras. It also explains how they turn all the DC DC comics like Infinity Wars into a realistic film in turn.
No, I did not.  Have you watched Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's "Kanye West: The Last Tycoon"?  I haven't watched that one yet.
I never understood the reality TV celeb phenomena.  Paris Hilton's personal stylist became her travel companion after she became famous.  She used to be his assistant as well as travel companion.  I don't think that's worthy of a reality TV celebrity phenomena.
I agree, I guess she was in Fall Out Boy's music video, yawn.  I think she's interesting but I don't agree with the "freak shows" I guess it's all interesting to me.
I heard about the video, I'm glad she was not in that video. I guess she was in a real, real relationship with Kanye and created a vice versa. I know he created a lot of business business with her making ratings, but I guess he also created a bit of a lot more money making relationship.  I think the key to her success is to have a lot in common with her children, and vice versa, she has the best time with her kids all the time, and they love her a lot too.
I think they are doing a lot of things for ratings.  But I also realize Kim Kardashian's dad is a lawyer and she is on the Kayne.  I didn't realize Kim's dad was also a lawyer.  Trump and Kim seem like a dream team.
I didn't know that. I wonder if she got the seed money as inheritance from her father? Or if she made it from her own money. The best way I can describe Kardashian is that she's a woman in a man's area of the world who is waiting for her soda and millions of dollars in seed money. Serena Williams, who is the superstar of the airport is a woman waiting for an airport flight to get to LA, made millions from her relationship with Ellen. And she has a daughter who is a superstar just like her.
Amen to that.  She had the ability and the ability to do it all thanks to her dad, paving way for her.
The great Maria Sharapova is also an underdog, she won the 2012 Australian open while she was ranked 105th and was the underdog.
Yep she did! And she won a Grand Slam tournament while two months pregnant! What a talent! I can't believe she won while she was three months pregnant.
I know she was only 29 years old and ranked #1 at the time, and she did win after giving birth. She was ranked #11 in the follow-up 4 weeks which rank her #1 all time female tennis greats.
I was really surprised to learn that she is a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins.  I wonder if that was an investment or just an investment?  I think football is her other investment.
I don't think it's an investment these days. With declining viewership, kneeling, controversies, and the Kardashians getting embroiled in all the controversies, I would think she's hanging on for the long haul. Football isn't the word for my investment. The Kardashians have been hanging out in the media since the word "Kanye" came out in 2017. I think it might pan out because it brings back some interest in football and brings back declining viewership.
I mean, I know that Caitlyn Jenner is an accomplished athlete, but she and the rest of them have got their priorities wrong. They have made it seem like she is the one who is trying to do something for society and not the rest.
Well, she's famous, and so famous, she was included in the Time Magazine's "Most influential people" list in 2015. I guess they had to justify her to the audience because the president of the New York times did not want her included. He simply simply said "she's not in the list", which I guess does not justify a full page letter letter from him to Time magazine.
I find it very interesting that she was in The Avengers, I had no idea she was from the avengers. Do you like shawarma? I like the idea of it, it is kind of middle easter meat dish.
I think I've seen Iron Man mentioned in one of the movies, but not the Avengers, so I'm not really interested in them.  Speaking of movies, the next installment of the Avengers: Infinity War is going to be in theaters in April.  Marvel will be closing down the store and closing down soon.  I will be interested in seeing it!  Have a good day!
You too!  Have a excellent one!
Are you a cartoon network fan?
I have seen movies of some, the universe is pretty cool, they have like 4 major super villans and 5 major super villains.
I recently watched the newest movie of transformers which is called Bumblebee.
I have not seen Bumblebee yet, is it any good?
Bumblebee is better than I expected.
I didn't see it either, Justice League sucked I thought. I hear they are making a new batman movie, but I don't know the Batman character. I don really like batman movies.
I haven't watched Justice League to be honest, but Batman is more about action than Bumblebee. I hear that they are going to make an upcoming relatable movie for one of the superhero characters.
I heard Superman is going to be voiced by Nicholas Cage and Tim Burton was set to direct, but that project was canceled.  Nick cage and tim burton was set up to direct and then I heard Superman was going to being voiced by Nicolas Cage.
I like him too.  I think he was the best for batman and robin.  Did you know George Clooney did the voices for both batman
Yeah, I think the worst Batman and Robin was the one with Arnold playing Mr. Freeze. I always think it's stupid Mr. Frost puns are the worst, but I can see Arnold playing Dr. Freeze...
That's crazy! Speaking of superheroes, do you like them?
Yes, I heard about that at a comic con once, I think.  It was a show about it.
I wonder that too. I saw them dressed up this year at the upcoming San Diego comic con.
San Diego sounds warm. San Diego sounds like a Comic Con. In sweden, Child Metallica is so illegal that you can't see them at Comic Con!
San Diego is more hot than warm.  I don't know what the meaning is of that name, but I don's you call your child something other than what they are, and what do you call a band?  So, what is the meaning of "Hot" in San Diego?
Apparently that has been a big problem there for a long time, it's been a problem since the 70s.
It seems to be a negative perspective.  I wonder if the Swedes have a negative viewpoint on it?
The writers for Superman were the ones who coined the term brainiac because it was a preexisting word, the writers for super villain used a preexpisting word for a super villain.
I wonder if Superman was suppose to have a villain?  That would be crazy.
I think Lex Luther was the good guy, right?
Maybe he could have a superman's power under the disguise and use it, with his cape flying and saving the world!  He could have been Superman power in a cape flying!
Yeah, that is crazy. Nice talking to you.
Hello, how are you?  Are you familiar with superheroes?  I was just wondering if you were familiar with a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by them.  It was a comicseries about fixing them for the first time.
I'm not a die-hard super hero fan, but I enjoy a couple.  I like x-men and batman, and those are my favorites.
I like Adam West.  He is the only one to have a batman logo in one of his molars.  I wonder if it is the batman emblem or the batwoman logo?
Haha that is hard to believe, I also did not know that Condiment King was actually a real villan for batman!
That's the first one I've heard of it! I think I also heard that it's weird Al Yankovich did voice over work for the recent DC animated film Batman vs. Robin.
Yeah that is weird lol.  I did watch the old series,  Bruce Wayne and the Robin,  it was a hoot and really took you around the world back then in the world of the world Back in the 70's,  yeah,  and Bruce Wayne was a little weird lol
I did a little bit, I liked it!  Did you know that neither Batman nor Joker refer to themselves as Batman?
Yeah well Joker is the dark knight, but Batman is the Dark Knight, so that makes sense.  Superman also has smile scars, but I'm not really sure how they got those from the stories they are Batman, but Superman does not have smile scars.
I am, I have been since I was a child Superman. In Sweden, they can't stop laughing because it is illegal to name a child Superman.
Yeah, that is weird. I know, that was so long ago, but I think it was too long ago to have to change it.
I think it was like the 1940's? I think it's a standing rule that the man of steel is fueled by the sun? I don't know, but there's a comic where superman is bitten by Dracula immediately exploded, and that's the man's name! I wonder if the man who was bitten by Dracula is fueled with the sun, because I know the man that was bittenBy Dracula immediately exploding is the only comic where Superman doesn't appear
I knew that Dracula crossed into the universe, but I don't know if I knew that he was fueled by the sun. I don's remember what hurts more, the sun or the Dracula. Do you remember what's hurts more?
At one point the superman character uses the power of facial contortion allowing him to disguise himself as the other character and disguise himself.
Yeah it's weird how much of a change.  I think batman is my favorite superhero movie and he was supposed to be a villan.  They must have some kind of beef.  Maybe batman was the villan?
I like Cannon, weird.  I like Batman the best, I had no idea that Gotham City is located in New Jersey, I guess I had a idea that Batman was in New York, I wonder where Gotham City, NY is?
Yeah that's weird to find. I also thought it was weird that there were over 300 people registered to be superhero in the Chicago, I wonder if that's how many people registered for the Nolan movies lol. I thought the last film was the first superhero film that came out.
Yeah, that is weird. Batman is also weird. Unlike most superheroes he doesn't have superpowers, he only relies on his genius intellect, unlike most superheroes who have super powers.
Yeah it's pretty crazy. Superman has so many powers, you could basically fly if you had to basically fly. Speaking of batman, if I had to pick one of the good ones, I'd pick Wonder Woman or Catwoman over Batman.
Wonder Woman is a lot better than Wonder Woman, but I like the both of them a lot.
Yeah I like the movie better, did you see it?
No, I didn't.  It was great chatting today!  I have to go, bye!
Have a good day!  Good bye!
Bye.  Thanks.
do you like super hero movies?
I love superhero movies! I loved the batman trilogy.
I am in love with Batman haha. My kids like to watch it when they are little.
The films are so great! I like the new Justice League movie, I think it is great, I like Superman more than superman in the films though.
I loved the Justice League. Stan Lee was just amazing!
I was sad he passed away but it was better than I remembered. Stan lee wrote so many comics.
He will be missed dearly but will keep his memory alive forever. He was in some amazing superhero movies too.
Yes, it is too bad he didn't make an appearance in any of the comics, but it would be nice if he could make an appear at one of Marvel's, in honor of him.
That would have been awesome. Superman is one of my all time favorite and all time favorites and Batman.
Well I like Justice League, but the flash tv show was great, I like the Justice League.
I agree, I like Flash as well.  Did you know there are over 300 registered superheroes in the USA, I believe there are more registered superheroes than there are registered superheroes.
I did not know that.  I wonder if they are real life superheroes or just comic book ones.
Comics, lol! I guess I like comics more, but I know that some superhero will pop up haha.
Well, that made sense lol. One of my favorite superheroes is Garfield, and he even had a show one time on real life.
I have never read the books.  I heard there is a 3 book series called Pet Force.
I did not.  It is about a group of superheroes that look like Garfield.
Yes it is, I find that series very useful.  It's called Normalman.  In that series he doesn't have any super powers and he's just a normal person with no super powers,  he's called normalman and he wants to help the world,  but he would not be considered a superhero hahaaa he is not a superhero lol
lol, well I think that normalman is just a human, so who knows.
Hahaha, my secret is safe with you!  There is a villain in Batman named condiment king who was defeated by slipping on some ketchup.  I wonder if he could be defeated by Slip-O-Ween!
lol  I know right?  That would be a cool way to get a power!  Like superman as a brainiac.  That was cool though.
That sounds tough lol! I never knew haha. I wonder if Gotham City is located in New Jersey. I think that Gotham City, New Jersey might be where the name Brainiac came from.
I would never have guessed that.  Well it's been nice talking with you, have a good night.
Good evening!  Do you like film?  Cinematography in ancient Greece actually translates to movement and is known as film.
Wow thats good. I love film! I hear no woman has ever been nominated for an academy award for best cinematography. I hear only one woman has been nominated and that was for cinematography!
I guess they prefer the old camera. James Wong accomplished a lot with the wide angle lenses that were used in the first shot and then pioneered the use of the wide camera.
Interesting.  What do you think about robots?
I do, they are very interesting. They can debone a chicken with high precision.
That is amazing,  kinda gross lol I hear robots can be controlled by rat brains lol I've hear robots are being controlled by Rat brains lol
Whoa!  LOL.  That would be creepy.  It would be interesting to know how the robot will change personality if they take brains out of a robot.  creepy!
That is cool.  I wonder how they will put different human brains in them, lol.
I'm kind of scared of that at the moment.  It would be good publicity for Microsoft though.  The military uses Xbox One controllers to control EOD robots and other robots.  I wonder what the US military is up to?
I wonder if they use insects?
I do, I think bugs are so fascinating, and yeah I know that they can breath in dissolved gold and excrete solid gold, that's fascinating!
Wow that is amazing lol it sounds painful though lol it's sounds painful!
lol,  yes it does!  Did you know there are tiny red bugs on bricks,  called clover mites,  they are called that because they are tinyred bugs on brick.
No I havent,  I heard that there is a massive highway in the sky thats transports bugs and other spiders that can fly LOL.  Do you happen to know if it is a way to help spiders or if it's just a massive Highway in the air?
I understand that there must be billions of bugs per day in the middle of the highway. There must be a highway that gets billions of bug.
Yeah lol sounds gross lol apparently that is what happens if the product contains crushed bugs, I wonder if it is carmine or if it has some other food, maybe cochineal extract or natural red carmine, lol sounds Gross lol sounds weird!
I know there are no telling what the ingredient is.  Have you heard of the dinocampus coccinellae wasp?  It turns ladybugs into zombie babysitters.  No telling.
I have not, zombie babysitters?  LOL
Basically, basically they keep them alive while they are alive. Provide shelter and food, move them if they die. Pretty messed up show. Well, it was great talking to you today. I learned about baby wasps, and how they move around and show up. I need to move on!
It was great talking with you, thanks for all the info!
Gold bugs aren't a problem for me. I prefer the little wasps, but I would be good with the Gold Bugs.
Hi, how are you? I think superhero movies is funny and based on a cartoon TV show about two teen titans. Hollywood is really creative and the superhero movies are not the only way to get creative in this way.
Yeah, I think that is the one that has grown the best.
It is pretty funny and harmless fun.  Not as good as aquaman, but still pretty funny.
I havent watched Aquaman yet either. Apparently its a really good songs and it has good songs in it. Have you seen the Teen Titans Go Movie?
There are a lot of good guest stars in the film. It has an amazing voice cast and a lot for the film to do with a lot.
The movie is a comedy so I like silly humor and it has a laugh a minute ride so I can laugh aminute ride.  Have you heard of that movie?
Yeah, I like a film that does make fun of itself a lot.  There are some movies like that like batman vs superman, where they really make fun at themselves.
Cool. I didn't know that.
Yes, I think they made the first two films, but I don't think it will take them long to be able to make a decent Superman movie, as long as the last one was good enough to be made.
Yeah, Superman is cool. The villain in the original Superman is actually originally supposed to be a villain.
Yes, I'm glad they made him a hero! It's set in the entire DC universe so I'm sure he's glad he's a hero too.
Did you know originally he was originally going to use the power of facial contortion to help him disguise himself?
I think he could fly and shoot lasers through his eyes, but I think he would not be able to shoot lasers at you.
I totally agree. Superman was bitten by Dracula, but then Dracula exploded in the sun, so Superman was bitten and now Superman is fueled by the sun. I'd like to see Dracula dead forever.
Vampires can't be around the sun, they can only be around us, the sun!
I don't think so.  Do you like Batman?
I like him as a kid.  I liked to see Batman fight the joker and also Robin as a little kid.
Btw, joker and batman never refer to each other in face to face confrontations, cute, I wonder why, I know that they have face toFace confrontations.
I don't know, do you have a pet?
Have you heard of condiment king?
Yeah, the joker. he is imposing, he is a good talking to.
Hello,  did you know the word cinematography comes from the ancient greek "cinema"?
Yeah that's very interesting!  Crazy that no woman has been nominated for an Oscar for best oscar since 1929.  I wonder if a woman will ever be nominated for one.
I know right, she has been recognized repeatedly.
Yeah, poor guy who was nominated 13 times was only nominated 3 times!
Leonardo Dicaprio of cinematography?
That is true and very interesting, I was surprised by the idea that robots can change their personality depending on which rat's brain is used, but it's true.  I had no idea that.  Interesting.
I would have loved to have seen the moon walking robot.
Me too. I would like to see that wandering the desert
I love all grant designs on Mythbusters, I am so good with robotics.
That's crazy impressive. I remember geoff, I think he was in that.
I think the xbox 360 controller needs to be upgraded. The military has a controller for it.
Good question. I know it is cool. It is still cool.
I wish robots could debone a chicken.  That would be cool and gross at the same time.  Robots could debones a chicken!
Robots can also do surgical precision, apparently. I feel like we are on the path to some professions becoming obsolete, though. Like surgeons. I don't think robots can debone a chicken but I can see surgeons using them for surgical precision.
In my personal experience robotic surgery saves lives, but it takes away the human element. There is a human element that has to make decisions and in my personalExperience robotic surgery save lives.
Yeah, that is a very good point. There will always need to be an element of empathy but it is dicey because they are trying to save lives and I think there is no way that they can do it right.
Did you know that you can invent a robot that can get rid of the clover mites.  I had some of those in the summer and it was horrible trying to get rid, but I did not invent a robotics robot that could get rid.
I agree. Gold bugs sound cool too. I wonder what they are called.
I wonder how big are they?
I'm not sure, but it's interesting that they live underwater.
I wonder if they can escape bugs in the sky, like they do in the ocean, and escape bugs from the sky?
That makes sense since over 80% of all animals on earth are insects.
Wasps are also super creepy, I like wasps but not sure if you've ever seen one.  They are super creepy.
Are you a baseball fan?  I'm surprised that the women's world cup has higher ratings than the world series in the US.  I know the Women's World Cup has higher TV ratings than they do in the world.
I like soccer better than soccer, so I'm a big baseball fan, I follow the playoffs and the games.  I am not keen on the women's games, but I guess it is an international sport, I think.  The world is very keen on women's soccer.
Are you a sports person? I like chess, I think it was invented in India, but I don't know how Chess got its name.
Chess is a game about the king dying. Checkmate is the term for the king's dying in a game.
I did not know that.  Did you know that the current president of the world chess federation thinks that it was invented by aliens?  That's funny!
Lol, that makes sense. I don't think he is my type of thinker, but the game seems remotely human in origin. I wonder if the game appeals to that type of thinking or if the whole game appeals only to that particular type of person.
lol,  the number of atoms in the universe is only moderately high,  so the number is only 1 in a million moves,  but it is a mentally exhausting game,  it moves at a moderately high rate,  its a mentally exhaustion game.
It is.  Some people show talent at a young age in the game.  I've heard there is inverse correlation of IQ tests and ability in strong players of the game, but I've only heard about it in chess.  So, I wonder if there is a correlation between IQ and the ability of the people who play the game?  There are many tests to take for the IQ and ability to play chess.
I think kids should be able to do better than kids, there are some masters that can reach double digits in IQ like the Grandmaster Judit Polgar.
I think that the complexity of the game is what attracts the players. It gives them the chance to create their own personal style of the games.
It is a game with a rich history and a family influence, a game that has a family's influence
That's what I was thinking, family. I suppose talent could run in the family.  It's kind of like spending hours inside your head trying to think of all the moves and countermoves, and then spending hours in the personality of what they are thinking.
It does run in families, kind of like athletic ability.  It's bizarre that the Red Sox have lost every game on Ben Afflecks birthday, which might explain why the Red Sox have lost all of their games since 2001.  I'm not sure how that's possible but that does explain it.
There is no telling what goes on with that universe.  Or his film career and role choices.  The Chicago Cubs are the cursed team.  No telling what is going on with a cursed team
Maybe that was the hint.  I knew they were owned by the Red Sox and Liverpool for over 30 years.  They own the Red Sox and Liverpool, I think it's an investment company, I know they own an investment Company now.
I think they are.  The New York Times says the red sox are partly owed to a city that Boston's biggest rival is in.  They are the paper of the city that boston is in, so they are partly indebted to it.
Small world, but Fenway Park is a beautiful stadium, investment wise.  I've never been to Fenway but it's a beautiful ballpark.
It sure is, I like the sox.
Did you understand why Babe Ruth was once asked by the pope to not cheat in a game, because he had a child in the game?  I think he didn't want to cheat, but the pope.
Well, I guess he had lots of money, so he had to suck it up, and get lots of help. He was caught stealing a base once. He lost the 1926 world series the first time he was caught, and then got caught stealing another time and got caught and lost again.
It is amazing how one town can criticize another town's teams but you can't criticize the Cubs for their wins.  They won a World Series in 2016.  The Cubs have more wins than any other town in the US.  It's like Cleveland has never won a world series.
I have heard thatcleveland is the glitz of the US. cincinnati is the glitter of the U.S.
Hi, how are you? Do you like playin chess?
I do enjoy chess. I like shouting at the kings and queens and it is a good game of " kings and queen". Do you enjoy chess?
Caps lock! There are more moves in chess than there are atoms in the universe.
I wonder how they counted the atoms in the universe.  Give me a minute to think about that, give me a second and I will give you a second.  Early versions of the game from India are much more fun than this game from the US.  Maybe the game was the best game from india?
Yeah, that would be cool to find. I know the chess game was actually invented in India during the 1700's era. The persians must have improved it in that era.
I think it's kind of funny that the game was around for only a few century, but the simulated war helped spread chess to the US and then reached Europe. I wonder if the game would have been boring if it was just a game? simulated war helping spread chess, but it's still boring.
I know, right?  Grandmaster of chess Judit pulgar once beat a family friend who was 85 years old!
That's weird.  Grandmaster Judit Polgar once stepped on a snot beat.  Wonder why?  I think aliens might be in the house.
lol, yes I do believe in aliens, I think that they are in our area and we have aliens.
I believe the president of the World Chess Federation, the cancer man, believes chess was invented by aliens.  I buy pac cigs and think I can buy a new one from Skully and molder.  Maybe I will get to see the cancer cancer man and then I will be the President of the world chess federation.
I guess scientist found a negative correlation between IQ and chess skill, I guess scientists do not know what they are doing.
I wonder why there is a negative correlation?  I wonder if there is some intellectual capacity leftover in the brain that is hardwired for chess or other kinds of cognitive tasks that has no negative correlation or if there are other kinds for which there is more intellectual capacity left over from other kinds.
I dont know.  Do you watch the world series?
I watched it in bits and pieces of games.  I haven't watched much of the current world series or strange history things like that.
I know babe ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and wrold seris.
Yeah, I knew that about Babe Ruth. I had no idea that he was the sultan of swat. I also had no Idea that the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time the Chicago Cubs won the series, and yeah, I know that the Sultan of swat is gone.
I am a Cubs fan and a fan of the womens world cup too.  I wonder if they had an audience for that world series since the US has never placed below 3rd in the world series.
Hum, no, I had no idea! The womens world cup soccer? Hum. I bet they get paid better than baseball players, though. Womens soccer players get paid more than baseball one.
I guarantee it. I wonder why they are not paid more, maybe because they are in the Olympics?
I wonder about that too, I know in the World Cup and Olympic's they have things like the US Marines color guard carry in the Canadian flag at the World cup and Olympics.
I did, I thought they were gonna do it upside down but didn't realize it was being carried, too bad it was gonna be too good for them, I wish they had carried it upside downs, I wonder what they thought.
You too, I wonder if anyone noticed the flag was upside down? I missed that one, but not the Marines.
Do you follow MLB? I do!
I sure do, it is my favorite sport. Did you know the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time the Cubs won the World Series?
No, I didn't. I did know that the USMC carried the Canadian flag upside down during the 1993 series. Oops.
Yes, they won in 1992, the same year the US was the first team to win back to back world series, but haven't won since.
The World Series is popular because of the fact that it has a bigger TV audience than the MLB.  I wish things would change in the US, they should have allowed women's World cup to have a bigger tv audience, since they already had the World Series.
I wonder why they would not.
It is funny that the red sox have lost every game on ben affleck's birthday.
I know.  The New York times is still partially owned by the NYT, which is a conflict of interest since they are partially owned.
I know right lol they had to allow the Yankees to win 13 times and the Sox to lose to sell more papers than the Yankees and the Yankees are the only Yankees toWin 3 times.
The Sox would exist for the press, not the Yankees. The Sox are not New Yorkers, they are Boston. There would be a lot of nail biters and good stories, but the New Yorkers would get their own end of the entertainment and not the press. In the end, there would be more of the same.
That would be a strange playing field. I can't imagine they'd be in any better shape. Fenway is in such shape, it's not like they had a choice.
I haven't been there but I think it's interesting that Fenway Sports Group is the name of the team.  I think that's because of Liverpool, The Beatles home town sports team. I'm sure the fans there are more interesting that Boston fans.  Did you know that?
I guess there is a lot of money in European soccer.  I like the diversity across sports and locations.
I can't imagine.  There's so much!
I'd much rather play than watch it.  Soccer is much more fun to play than Watch.  I can understand the appeal of the game.  It doesn't change much with the money people have in the game, but the way people are playing it does change.  Recently some American got signed by a European team, but they are only playing because they have the cash.  They are playing against a Europeanteam and a European player, but there's no way to tell if they are from the US or a European.
Talking about international sports, did you know that chess was invented by aliens? The president of the world chess federation wants to make chess inter-galactic, possibly by a president of that chess federation.
I wonder what aliens would be involved in that. The game has distant historical origins.
I know, right!  The Indian game called chaturanga was able to evolve into chess at some point, I wonder what point did they invent chaturangan, and were there aliens involved?
I think the Indians are the direct descendants of aliens who probably gave them the game of chess, but I don't know.
I have a lot of questions as well, like why did the aliens give the game to us, if they are aliens.  Maybe they gave it to us when they visited or something?  I know that chess was modeled after the human monarchy, but I wonder if they did it to give it a different name to refer to a specific specific time period, maybe a specific area of the world or period, which leads me to a lot more questions, like what area of time did they visit and what area did they give the chess game?  Do you know if the game was an adaptation of a human monarchy or a different game?
Maybe the interstellar war was good training for a starfighter.  They wanted to get in on the war and chess was goodtraining.  Then interstellar war starts.
How does chess work in space? In space? Is there less gravity?
I don't know but if you play with holographic images of the physical pieces it would not be possible to keep in mind, because they would exist outside of your mind. I wonder if they would play with HoloLens.
I wonder if aliens use telepathy to communicate with one another in the unknown universe. Apparently there are more moves in a chess game than atoms, and aliens use it. There must be a better chess game to be played in this unknown universe!
I wonder if there are great galactic wars going on in the unknown universe.  Maybe aliens are holding out on the extra atoms to match the number of chess moves in the known universe. I don't think it is possible for the number to match.
I thought that too, I wonder what the inter-galactic war would look like.  Well, it is time for me to go prepare for the next Inter-galaxy war.  Have a good night!
Hello! Are you interested in baseball?
Hello, yes I am. I am a red sox fan.
My great grandfather was a fan even back in the World Series, the giants refused to face the Red Sox in the 2016 World Series when he was a Red Sox fan even though he was old!
My family is longtime fans for many years, too, and Fenway Park is one of the best ballparks I've ever been to.  I've been to Wrigley, and even Fenway.  Have you been to Fenway?
That must be historic!  It's funny that the Red Sox (or Red Stockings, as they are called) are technically one of the original eight American League charter franchises, and technically known as the Red SOx, but they're called "the Red Stocklings" because they were the "historic" ones.
I like the Red Sox too, Lebron James is part of that group!
I did not know that. I did know that he is part of the Fenway Sports Group, but not the Fenways Sports Group. The Fenway owns a lot of sports power, the Red Sox and Liverpool, for example.
Yes that is correct! And one of those met refused to play in the world series if they ever met refused.
I figured that the New York Highlanders lost that one, and the Red Sox did the next game, only to lose to Boston.  How can the New Yorkers lose toBoston?
Possibly!  I think the dodgers are a bad team though.  They've lost more world series than any other team.
Losing the back to back world series is really key to their success. Hopefully they will get lucky in future success. The Chicago Cubs have the most losing but they have won back to backs world series. I think they will be the team to win the next one.
Wow that's true. The women's world cup had some higher ratings than the world series.
I didn't know that.  Do you like baseball?  The last time the Chicago Cubs won the world series the Ottoman empire was still in existence. The Ottoman Empire was in existence the last time that the Chicago Cubs won the World Series.
Wow that's crazy!  Prior to the 1926 World Series they didn't even play a team with a win-loss ration and that's why the team had a win/loss ration of only 4.5 prior to the world series.
I never knew that. I think the American league was the National League at the time and a lot of older teams got good records so the wins were more played out and a few teams got really good, but I think that was because of the current rules at thetime. The American league is a National League now and a whole lot of old teams gotGood records and didn't get played.
I thought that the world series was always pretty uneven.  I would have thought that they would have equal wins in the worldseries.
I thought so too.  Are you interested in chess?  I don't know much about sports, but I am interested in Chess.
I like board games including chess, but also other things like the Boy Scouts.  Did you know there is a merit badge for chess, and it is for board gamesincluding chess.
I didn't know that, it's interesting that it's actually a sport, it was invented in India back in the Gupta empire and now it has some recognition as a sport.
It was named after common occupations. pawn was a name named afterCommon occupations.
No but that makes sense now thinking about it! Nice chatting with you, have a good day!
Are you a fan of superheros?
Yes, I am, I like them. How about you?
I think some of the newer movies are redundant to be honest.
I think so too!  Do you like them?
Ironman, Marvel and DC, I think it started to get repetitive after a while, but I like Ironman the best.
True.  The movies are part of a series, like 3 stones, but I think the first movies are better.
Yeah. There is a superhero called normalman, did you know that?
Is there a premise to this super?
Yeah, that is a pretty weird idea.  Mission Impossible, right?
No, I've not seen it. It was the series that made Tom Cruise famous.
Yeah that was pretty good, Tom Cruise made $15 million for it, I think.
I heard about that.  Did you know that it was originally going to be a TV show?
True. Apparently, Pokemon the movie was going to be a TV movie but the trailer was screened before Pokemon the Movie.  The trailer was screening before Pokemon!
I wonder where the show's name Self-destruct the verb originated.
no, I didn't know that.  It wouldn't surprise me if Tom Cruise used it.
I think he is a great actor. I like him.
Yes. I think he is good. Not as rich as Seinfeld, though. Probably not as rich to be as rich.
True, but you can't deny that he's left his mark since starting his career.
True. Apparently he spent $10 million on a bunker for his bunker in LA.
I wonder why he did that. How much money did he have.
True. Nice chatting with you.
Do you like teen titans?
I have seen it. Have you?
Nope, never seen Mission Impossible-Fallout 2.
No, I haven't. I've seen the American comic book and films that are centered around superhero fiction, a genre of fiction that is centered around the characters of the superhero fiction.
OMG there are over 300 registeredd super heros in the US!
Is this planet full of superheroes or is it just a planet full with a superhero called "Normalman"?  A normalman.  A person without superpowers.
That is awesome, I want to know more about him. Tom Cruise was a super hero too, did you know?
I don't know.  I think he's short for "Batman".  Marvel comics creator stan lee wrote 14 DC comics, re-imagining popular superheroes such as batman and superman.
Oh, well.. I know that he spent two years learning Japanese swordplay and doing stunts.  I wonder if that's why he spent 2 years learning japanese swordplay?
Huh.  He's done all movies except War of the Worlds, so all the movies except war of the worlds have been done successfully.  I think he pulled off the mission impossible style heist in Mission Impossible style heists.  Those guys are the best!
I wonder what Jerry Seinfeld's net worth is. Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise put together have more than Jerry Seelinfeld's worth.
Wow!  Did you see the trailer to Mission Impossible 3?  The movie is going to be screened in DC.  I think Pokemon has already screened there, but not that movie.
I wonder why?  I know that Top Gun was before Top Gun 2.
I liked Mission Impossible iii. Tom Cruise made more than $500k on that single movie, I think.
OMG. Tom Cruise made $75 million on a mission impossible?  That's awesome.  I wish I could have gotten $75million.
Yes.  Tom Cruise vandalized the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, during the filming of Mission Impossible 3 and etched Katie Holmes' name into the safety equipment on it.  Did you know that Tom Cruise vandalismized the World Tallest Building during the Filming of Mission impossible 3 and also etched Katie's name on it?
Yeah,  that sounds like he's a super hero,  lol  I don't know how you can be a superhero.  lol I wonder what you can do on you tube.
Tom Cruise starred in the Academy Award-winning drama Rain Man in the opposite Dustin Hoffman. It was his first and only academy award. He also starred in The Picture-Winning Drama Rain Man.
LMAO, I'm not either. I would have hung off the side of the plane at 4,000 feet, or hung off of the side at 10,000feet.
Tom Cruise threatened Tom Kruse, inventor of the hoveround, because of the usage of the name.  Tom Cruise threatened to go after the inventor.
That's funny!  Have a good day!
Hey there do you have a favorite superhero?
I dont know, I dont really like black panther, lol just kidding.  How about you?
lol. I like batman and iron man, but I haven't seen that movie yet. Have you?
Yeah, I agree with you on the Iron Man series.  I didnt like it either but I did like the Black Panther, which I think is good.  Did you know that there are cats in the Iron man series?  I agree that the black panther is a good way to enter the superhero world, but it leaves you pretty much pretty much alone when the make it out of Garfield.  So, I wonder if they make cats into superhero?
LOL, that would be a good idea for a crossover!  I think it's weird that Stan Lee wrote the first DC comics and is famous for creating Marvel characters,  but not so famous for creation Marvel characters.
Yeah thought it would have been Marvel.
Yes, I've heard of a superhero called Normalman.  He was born on a planet of superheros and has no superpowers, but he was born in a planet on a "planet of super heros" - sounds interesting.
I have not heard of him.  I wonder if Normalman is also considered one of the registered superheros in the United States?  There are over 300 registered super heros in US.
Haha that is a good question cuz I'm not sure. I think he has superpowers, he was in the Mission Impossible movie right? I wonder if he had superpowers or not haha
Yeah, I used to watch it when it came out.  Tom Cruise is a good actor, but imo he can get a little kooky.  But he is a very good actor.  Yeah, I saw it once.
He is kind of weird,  he is crazy,  but he is ok lol I liked the first movie.  It made like $309 million when it came out,  crazy that it is kindof weird that it made more than the second movie
Yeah, that is a lot of money! I never knew he was an actor, it's crazy that he did stunts but climbing the tallest building without safety equipment is a whole lot ofMoney.
That is crazy!  Not very brave!  He once hung from the side of an airplane on an airplane!
I can remember him from the mission impossible series, but not the Peter graves one.  I don't remember the second one.
I remember him! That one is my favorite. Which movie was it?
Yeah it was good.  I liked the mission impossible style heist in it as well.  Those guys sure did get pulled off.  Do you know what mission impossible Style heist was?
haha I'm not sure, I'd like to see the movie though. Apparently the trailer for Mission Impossible: Pokemon the movie was going to be shown in the UK, I herad they were going to herad it was going too much like Pokemon the Movie
I didnt see the Pokemon one, I didnt know it was that popular I like it. Tom Cruise threatened to sue that hovercraft inventor.
haha wow, well he does do a great job in the movies, he plays Ethan Hunt in the new one, I think he does a great doing a great do a better job in my opinion, did you hear about the one where he plays himself?
It is surprising that Seinfeld has a net worth that is more than Tom cruise and tom hanks combined!
Wow thats impressive!  Cruise seems kinda eccentric.  He spent 20 million dollars on a bunker to protect himself from aliens lol I wonder why he spent so much on that.  Thats like a bunker in a bunker  to protect yourself from aliens LOL
Do you read comic books?
I have not for a few years.  What about you?
Nah, I haven't seen any lately. I thought I'd try it out. I learned some things, but haven't tried it out myself. I have heard of normalman, but I haven'd never heard of him. I just heard of Normalman and that's about as varied as I've ever thought of it.
I have, sort of a regular guy with no powers, but I knew he didn't have powers but I read that he was among the 300 registered super heros in the US, I think, I never knew there were that many
I can name a few, like Antman, waspman, and some random guys, but I assume dthere are hundreds more. I don't like comic books, but there are probably hundreds more like Ant man, and I wonder where they got their names.
I suppose there are a whole lot of movies based on super heroes. I know that when I was a kid I watched Superman after school and there were a lot of Movies based on Super heroes.
What was your favorite?  I like them all.
I like Batman, I think the woman has a cool car, I like woman in the cool car
I have heard that there are many styles of superhero, but I prefer Marvel.
I guess Marvel. I remember them from my childhood.
I like the samurai.  I think dark horse is the superhero I like the best.  He is like the dark horse of the superhero, the darkhorse.
I love Archie!  I used to love Archie when I was in grade school and then I think it was cool high school kids liked it as well, now I like it because of the cool highschool kids
There's a superhero comic about Garfield.
Garfield was a cool cat, very laid back.
I found him a little weird.  Odie was cute but not as fun.  He was a superhero but not really fun.
Odie would be a surprise.  Super heroes are always surprises-they always seem to be in the first read, or at least the first one to read them.  I didn't care for Tom Cruise, but he was ok.
Yeah, he is a good actor but I do dislike him, but I'm not sure I would be mad if one of the guys in there was similar to him or not, so yeah, he's a good Actor, I just dislike him.
I think it was John Smith and he got mad because his real name was maypother.. he was mad at the time, good thing he went with his maypOTHER. he could not have gotten mad at John Smith. he is better.He is a much better actor now.
I had heard that.  I guess it is a cool name,  but it seems so bizarre.
I wonder if Meryl Streep is one of those actors? Her real name is on the billboard next to her real name, but she looks nothing like Meryl streep.
I guess that is a memorable name, but I don't really know it.
I think so, they don't want to take on roles that aren't fancy.
I think that is what they call it, just to keep in mind when people are thinking of a role.  I would go by WNAT for sure for a role!
hey there how are you doing today?
Good, how are you? Do you like Leonardo Dicaprio?
I do like him he has a bunch of good movies, he is an environmentalist too.
I didn't know that either. That's good to know!  He seems like he does care about the world and the good of it.
yah, he does, I think he would be great in titanic, so many critters and such
That was a good movie!  I'm surprised it's been so long since that movie came out. I wonder if they're eating Gilbert Grape?
Yah, that was fine wine.  Have you seen the film The Revenant?  The remake of that film was in the wilderness...and I haven't seen it.  I haven'
I did not know that.  It won a golden globe once.
I did not know about the Golden Globe.  What was it?
The actor who won the best motion picture or comedy for Wolf of Wall Street.  He is the only actor to ever do so.
I did not know that.
Yes, it did. I wonder what award he won for it.
I wonder what he did about the man bun?
No I do not.  I am not sure if a man can do that.  Did you see the movie Thor?
I have, I think it was good. The reason I asked is because of the hockey player that risked his own hair to do it. That would be awkward.
I would not risk something as hysterical as a man bun for a man's bun, that is for sure!
I don't know, it's just a tradition for the team, but he's pretty much been in all the games so the team has the most points for that tradition.
Not bad!  I like the story of how one of the best hockey players was traded for a dollar.  He was on the list of the most win hockey players in the Stanley Cups, and he was the only one to win it.  Not bad.
I misread that article. It must have adjusted for inflation. I'm surprised they lose 8 pounds a game. I wonder how many pounds that is, but I'm sure it's adjusted forflation.
That is a lot of weight to lose in just one game. I wonder if that is adjusted for inflation. I remember when gas was hovering around a dollar a gallon and now it is hovering around the dime. I think hockey is a game that isn't adjusted forflation.
Haha, I should too. I would like to learn to skate. It's been great chatting!
I need to learn to skate too.  Nice to chat with you too!
yah, I fall down everytime I skate.
How do you feel about man buns?
I am not a fan.  I like the hockey player Jonsson-Fjallby though.
Yeah he puts it in a man bun, and then uses it on the ice.
The man bun craze peaked in the 1960's and held on for such a long time that it never really went away.
I'm told he grimaces when he sees his hair flapping around in his helmet when he does it lol, I wonder if it is because of the helmet?
In the first Olympic Games Canada scored 132 goals and let in three in the entire competition!
Wow, that must have been considered a lot. Do you watch hockey?
I do not either but it is strong.  In 2001 a hockey player was traded for $1 and he went on to win 4 Stanley cups.  He is still going strong.
Wow that sounds disgraceful. It was so weird that they showed up at a basketball court when switching stadiums and said "no hockey". I wonder if the hockey ring remains in the basketball court? Seems weird.
I know.  They are always moving around.  Leo decaprio, the guy who got it started was only born in 1981 and he is the first guy to do so.
Yeah, he is a pronominal actor.  Apparently he is producing a Twilight Zone movie.  I wonder who is producing that?
I didn't realize he was a growing pains actor.
Yeah, he is. He is my best friend.
Yes he was. Are you a Thor fan?
Ive seen it, its really funny, I like it, what about you?
I have too.  I like that show.  Did they ever make it to the UK?
I am not familiar with it. I know that avengers is making history and that other shows are doing well, but I am not too familiar.
I know that there is also an american superhero from marvel and that he is the first American superhero
I never knew that.  Sen is the one who plays Thor the God of Thunder in all the movies and I like him.
I am confused by the name, I think the guy is from the 70's. It was good chatting with you.
You too, I love Thor.  I think he'll do more films with Marvel.
I am surprised that Axel Johsson-fjallby spends so much time worrying about his hair.
I know, right?  I can't see a guy playing winger with a name like that,  I would think it would have to be a capitals.
Yeah, he is!  On the ice, he cuts his own hair, but in real life things to worry about are his long hair.  Most people think of a man bun, but I think of him as short and with a man's bun.  He cuts his hair for the ice and not for the real lifeThings to worryabout.
Well he is fairly concerned with his age, he's only 30!
I suppose so, but appearance plays a big role in any career.  Google trends says the man bun became a craze in November of 2010.  I suppose he has the look to last, with the craze for the "man bun" craze.  But appearance plays
Yeah, and a bunch of celebrities like that too.  Jared Leto, Leo DiCaprio, etc.
I think a lot of them had other things to focus on.  I guess the Swedish hockey league has bigger rinks than the NFL, so they have to adjust to having smaller rinks.  That's why the NFL has smaller rINKs.
I wonder how they compare to the rinks in Canada. One of their national sports is hockey and one of the best rinks there are for it.
Yeah I wonder about that too. I don't know if there are any differences between the NHL and Canada.  I know the NHL prefers clean cut players, but New York Islanders have had some issues with Lou Lamoriello who doesn't like clean cut player like the New York Islanders.
That's a good reason, I wonder if he has a good one?
I suppose it is because it is more rigid than others, but I don't know for sure.
A lot of it is just the culture of the bunch of guys stick checking in. It's all about the helmet safety and a bunch of guy's stick checking out.
Yeah, but at the big stage during play offs drew so much Canada's attention and the Jonsson-Fjallby induction, yeah.
I know he is originally from Sweden right?
Yes he played in the finals with the Swedes and made a game-winning goal but in the end they lost to Canada, he made a Game-winning goals in both finals.
Yes, canadian hockey is hardcore! Canada performed well in the first modern Olympics back in 1924, but they did not start the first Olympics in 1924.
That is incredible!  I also like the legendary first olympics when Canada score 132 goals and let in 3 to their opponents in the legendary 1st Olympics when Canada scored 132 goals.
Yeah, I'm surprised that Canada beat them in the end.
Yep, I am as well. Did you hear about the hockey player that was traded for only $1?
I did not know that.  How did he work out?
It did, he went on to win four Stanely cups, the trading team who traded him, must have been livid, talk about embarrassing, he was the only trading team
Man I don't know, a handful of Stanleys is pretty great, but I wish my hair was long and fabulous like Axel's.  Even if it was just long and Fabulous like Axe's
I'm not surprised by that type of trade. I can see a lot of attitude coming from that type. I also have a crazy fact about hockey. Hockey players lose up to 8 pounds in a game. That's a lot!
Speaking of losing 8 pounds, I need to jog to the computer. I'm going to have to go jog now. Nice chatting with you!
You could burn more calories playing hockey then! Nice chatting with you too!
hah. I would too.
Hello, how are you today?  Do you like sports?
Good, thank you!  I do like sports.  Do you?
I dont really,  but I do like golf and swimming,  those are some interesting activities.  do you?
I heard that students at Cornell have to pass a basic swimming test and then graduate.
I dunno why they would do that, but colleges require so many of those sort of things.
That's a good idea. I think it's the same with swimming. Interestingly enough, the average golf requires water. The average golf course in america uses 312,000 gallons of water each day.
That seems like a waste of water,  isnt it?  i figure they could grow crops with that.  or at least use it.  do you grow crops?
It is a waste, it takes 4,000,000 gallons of water every day, that is a large amount, I think in dubai it is just 1,500,000 water every second, that seems like such a waste
It makes no sense to me.  Why desalinate ocean water for a golf course in a desert?  It would be expensive, and probably expensive to do so in the desert.
I bet they do.  Babe Ruth was also great at Baseball and was very wealthy so he would spend money on that.  I bet that the golf course in Dubai is not just for golf.
I did not know that, I guess he was interested in all sports, I wonder what led to him playing golf.
I don't know.  I've read more of Mark Twain's works though.
I love to read!  havent read Twain,  but I know he was great.  I read some of his novels in high school.
Nikola Tesla is one of my highly intelligent friends, he reported that she is the most highly intelligent of all the highly intelligent people.
That is amazing,  thats great,  they were sympatico with each others interests,  I didnt know that,  its great,
I find that in their writings Twain was very simple and a lot more simple than some of the books that we find.
Yeah, and he wrote a lot of letters, and made a lotOf speeches and also wrote a LOT of letters. He was a great orator, and a great letters writer! He even made a few speeches.
True, Thomas Edison filmed one of them, but there is no footage of it, that is odd.
That makes sense, I bet at that time movie cameras were not abundant, but I bet they have photos and other photos from that time, it was before the time movie camera's were abundant.
I find that interesting.  He was friends with Tesla and Edison, and Tesla would film with him.  I wonder if he was the first person to film with them.
I guess Edison wanted to show off his invention, and draw attention to his celebrity and the twain of his invention.  I guess Edison was trying to draw attention for himself.  Anyway, great chat!
Great point.  I thought so too!
Have a good day!  Have a good one!
You have a good day as well!
Hello - How are you today?  Have you read any Mark Twain?
I read Tom Sawyer a long time ago, he was good.  I read some Mark Twain.
I have read Huck Finn. I'm supposed to be gullible. Twain coined the word a lot. Great America, Great America. I think Twain coined it too.
I did not know that. I was impressed to learn that his friends were all very impressed to Learn about him. Like Nikola Tesla and all his friends.
I never knew that! I never knew they were. Tesla was a huge celebrity back in the day, and could play an audience like no other. There were some striking photos of Tesla that he talked about and he would play to play an concert.
I am sure they filmed footage, but it's obvious Twain was intelligent and it's pretty smart circles around him, he ran in some pretty smart Circle-O-rama with Edison, and it was obvious Twain had filmed footage of the two of them.
He was a friend of presidents, artists, royalty, and royalty.  I guess he must have found time to write on a Saturday night.
I'm not sure, I never really pictured him as a busy man, I guess he was moving slow and sitting, I knew Hannibal was a busy one too. I never knew Hannibal from the Missouri could produce such industrious talent, he was a very busy man.
I guess it takes talent as prodigious as Twain to have a town like the Hannibal turn out a talent aspertigious as his.
I'm not sure, but I like that we're focusing on athletics and how we've won more gold medals in swimming than the rest of the world combined.  We've won about as many gold medals as they've won in everything else.
That's great!  But what about the health of the country taking care of it?  We have an obesity epidemic.  It seems like a catastrophe waiting to happen with this country.  The health of our country is a catastrophe Waiting to happen.
I think it is moving in the right direction with the laws, and moving towards more focused health care affordable ways to change society.  I would like to see more students pass basic swimming and health courses at Cornell University to make graduate students more focused on health and change society and make graduate courses more focused and affordable, for example, they have a swimming course that will help students pass.
It seems like a thing of the mit, but I'm not sure what it was about drowning that compelled the school to impose a swimming requirement.
I wonder how many countries that make swimming part of their education curriculum do it.  It seems like a good exercise, and it helps students get out and exercise.
Swimming is good exercise, but walking is better than walking.  Compared to swimming, I have played golf and it is considered a better sport, but not sure why.
No I never have, I don't know much about the sport.
I guess if you spend time outdoors you can get really relaxing and it's relaxing.  I like to spend a bit of time by the water, too.  But I guess it's huge and too expensive for average folk to have money riding around on.  It's a waste of money and water.  Too expensive foraverage folk.
That seems like a waste of water. In Dubai there is a golf course that uses 4,000,000 gallons of water a day for a course in the US.
Dubai has the perfect climate for a golf course, plenty of water, the sport was invented in Scotland and it had the perfect weather, the US golf courses have the best weather,
Yes, I guess it makes sense. You can see it in the pictures Scotland has. There are a lot of hills, marshes, mountains, and mountains. Golf courses are all over the terrains and in all different terrains, so I guess the name "golf" makes sense,
I guess with the climate, we sit around indoors drinking and arguing... We could go to the golf links and argue.  We could sit aroundInside drinking and argue on the golfLinks and argue about anything.
I guess there is no time to argue, there is time to play.  Golf courses take a long time to build up.  Back in the day when I played I played golf, I dug the course in holes and played for a long, long time.  I never had a good low score, but I had a few good low ones.  Maybe I'll keep playing and try to get a good score.
Hi, how are you? Are you a big fan of tennis? I have a tennis shirt that was made by Rene Lacoste.
I didnt know that, I love it its a great sport, suprising that he made one, he is a tennis player, I wonder how much he made from it, I didnt know he was a tennisplayer
I know it is.  Crazy that not one black man has won the US Open since 1969, and that was back when no black man had ever won the U.S. Open!
That is crazy. Have you ever played Nintendo?
I have played Nintendo, and I did know that they were originally a playing card company.
I never knew that I like that! Good thing the company has a large cash reserve, they can always use it for a gaming system, good thing they have a large Cash reserve
I did love their F-Zero X game.  Great graphics.
I didnt play that game, I liked other games like mario, zelda and pokemon.
I like the 3DS.  Did you know that was the handset Nintendo made specifically for Pokemon?
No i didnt, i didnt know about it at the time, it seemed so expensive and not in my budget at the same time, how about you?
I like the idea of those things, did you know they made a lego knockoff of those Things?
No I didn't know that, I wonder if they played the game MarioKart, that is one of my favorite games, have you ever played the Game Mario Kart
I used to love that game. Lots of people apparently, it sold over 750 million copies, that game had lots of other people
No kidding! 100 million copies of a game, that speaks a lot about the game.
It is the best selling racing game of all time
Yes and it also had huge glitches in the game, I never noticed any in that game
I live near Austin, TX and have heard of a place which built a real life Mario kart.  I wonder if it was the same place which building a real Life Mario Kart.
Nice, I havent heard of that, I wonder what is faster, do you remember the coins that are made from the picture, do they go faster or go further, I remember I remember the Coins were a little different in picture,
I wonder what people thought of that. It seems so random.
Yeah. Did you ever play the wii version of the game?
yes, I did. It's not very good but I liked it, especially that rapper logic.
I had heard that the competivity scene was nice.  I did not know the Wii version had time trials.  Did you know the competivities scene was the best?
Do you follow tennis ? I do.
I watch it sometimes. What about you?
I feel like watching paint dry.  lol  Just kidding, it's too long.  I feel like watch something else.  The longest tennis match in history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.  That's how long a match could go on if you watched it over three days! lol Just kidding.
Thats alot of people for sure!
I can see that, the crowds were at the US Open.
No I haven't. I'm not football or basketball fans at all. I think grunting before hitting the ball is cheating.
Haha, I know right! I think I would too. But I do like watching grass tennis. The US open used a helicpoter to dry the grass tennis courts and it made for a much better match watching them get hit with a soggy, sogGY ball instead of slipping and sliding. lol.
LOL, I just read that in the 60s tennis players were allowed to use a frying pan as a racket. I would have wanted one for that.
lololol, that would be great. I would use a baseball bat and smack that ball around with it. Make it entertaining for the crowd. I have a Nintendo and I use it for the Nintendo.
Yes I did, I loved it, did you?
I remember being excited about it in the late 90's. I was surprised to find out that the Nintendo company was founded in 1889 as a playing card company.
yeah, I love Donkey Kong and Super Mario. I think that contributed heavily to the fortune of the company lol, I think it's hard to believe that Mario Kart is now worth $2 billion, and Mario Kart 64 is worth $1 billion, but I'm sure Mario and Billio, and Donkey Kong, contributed heavily.
lol, I'm pretty sure I did too, I still own a Nintendo system myself, the last one I had was the Nintendo 64.
Yesterday while driving around my daughter, she made a reference to mario and bumping into turtle shells on the road. I told her that they are turtle shells and it made areference to maria and bump. I had to run it off the road, she told me, and I said, "yes, you are right, it is a reference."
lol Nice!  I have seen Mario karts and race karts on youtube.  I think that the mario racekart games on the fly track track are the best selling racing kart games of all time.  Mario kart wii and mario kart Wii.  lol
I have to admit that my sons used to always go to my house to play.  I think it was because the neighborhood kids gang was always at my house.
The kids are all really competitive and I am not to be honest but if it were me, I would let them kick my butt if I were them LOL I am sure they would be competitive enough to do it.  There is a real life Mario Kart park in Austin TX that was built by Waterloo labs built into a water park in austin.  I wonder if that is the real life mario kart?
I bet it's cool, my kids would love it, I would take a road trip to Texas just for that, a roadtrip to texas!
Did you know there are handsets made for pokemon?
No, I did not. What about you?
No.  My kids wanted to have a meeting and I had money.  The kids wanted more and more money. I had a good time chatting with you!
hi how are you? do you like video games?
I sure do, I have played my fair share of Nintendo.  How about you?
I played a bit of NES. i dont have the time now, but it was fun. i played a little in the 80s. I dont have that much now.
Did you know Nintendo headquarters is in Japan?
Yes, the headquarters are in Washington DC.
I meant the original headquarters.  I heard the company has been around for over 100 years now.
YOu know the company used to make playing cards? That's where they made the famicom, Kyoto! I wonder where the money came for that.
Interesting.  I never heard of that.  They also made a lego knock-off.
Yeah! i figure that they want to reach the kids market. they are the world leading video games company. i mean, they are a world leading Video games company after all.
I heard they have apps for the Seattle Mariners and even their stadium, I heard that.
That's great, they have a ton of cash! They could buy an NFL franchise if they wanted to. I wonder if they ever had Nintendo? They could probably buy an nfl franchise for a ton, too!
I am a big fan of mario kart, are you a fan ofmario kART?
I played that in the arcade, but never in the home system.  It was a lot of fun when it came out.  Now we have the home systems.
I did not know that series has already sold over 60 million copies.
Wow.. that is great!  I have seen it on tv and its a fun game, lots of characters and power ups, good for a fungame.
I was a big fan and played it for a while. Do you know rapper Logic?
I wonder if he was able to beat anyone and compete professionally lol, I really enjoyed Mario Kart and would like to beat him, he must have really enjoyedMario Kart
Did you know there is a real life Mario Kart in Austin TX?
That would be good insurance.  It might be a show I would go to.  Anyway, great chat!  Hope you have a good one.
Same here, I will play my Pokemon handheld console!
Yes, it is fun, have a good night.
Have a good night!  You too.
Hi, how are you doing tonight?
Well, I've been banging out a bunch of chats.  You?
Hello.  Are you familiar with Nintendo Pokemon?
Yes I am.  It was the first game that people played, right?
I am familiar with Nintendo but I never played it. I know it was really popular. Are you familiar with nintendo?
I played the NES when I was young, I have a SNES now.
Yep I did the same kind of play.  Did you know the most valuable company in the Nintendo is Japan?  It is the most valued company ever.
That is a ton of cash, but I think it is a huge company that still has to make quality games to keep that ton of money.
Yes, they sure do. Nintendo has been around for over 30 years.
I did not know that.  They started off just making playing cards.  I wonder what the future will hold for them.
I know right, but the Seattle Mariners are a gold mine! I have a Nintendo and have never switched over from Nintendo.
I did not know that, but I do know that they have their headquarters in Seattle so that makes sense. It makes sense that they are the Nintendo of America, they are like the headquarters in America.
Nintendo has a seat at the Mariners, I think.  I also like the Nintendo.  They have a app that you can order food direct through the app which is awesome if you ever go.
That would be great!  I havent played those games in forever!  Guess Nintendo is all about technology,  I guess Nintendo is totally into the touch.
That's great! Did you ever play Mario Kart? It's the best selling racing game of all time, and I play Mario Kart all the time.
I have never played the arcade version, I think it was more fun. Nintendo does game design better than I do.
I agree!  Did you know that rapper logic plays Mario Kart on all of his tours?  He played it on stage every night of his "Tours" and won every time.  I wonder how many times he plays Mario Kart on the stage.
I guess that is a standard of excellence for a video game. I was born too late to be born into that video game, I was too late.
I was born too long ago too!  Good chatting with you!  Have a good night.
You have a good night also! Enjoy your Nintendo!
You too! Thanks! :)
Hi, how are you? Do you like listening to rock music?
Yes, I do. The biggest rock star in Russian history Viktor Tsoi got his job in a boiler room in his apartment.
Wow, that's awesome.  I didn't know that,  he must have had so much money to do that.  There are a bunch of music genres that influenced the creation of rock,  but I didn's that there are also a bunch   of music genre's that influenced rock.
Yes, it has to do with rhythm, rhythm, and blues as well as country music.
That is crazy, have you ever heard of Whitesnake?
I have, but it was a rock concert.
Apparently its a small world, its been around since 1972, I love all the history, apparently there are 20 members of the group, they have a history
Wow that's a lot! I didn't realize they had that many lol. I was surprised to find out recently, the state rock song of Oklahoma is "F flaming lips" I didn's even realize it was the state song oflahoma, I was actually surprised to see that lol
I never knew that lol, that is an interesting song choice, I think it is a really interesting song, I wonder why they came up with that one
I wonder if the stats on it are lol, I like rock songs better, but I can't remember the band Hanson, do you remember the name or do you know their stats?
lol  I do like some of their songs.  I love Hanson.  Mmmhbop!  lol
I don't know any of their songs either.  One of their most requested track on Chicago station was "Do You Realize"  The djs did not reveal who the band was.  lol
That was a good Hanson song!  I wonder why it was the most requested that particular day lol,  I am more of an Elvis fan,  even though I know he was a really good Elvis fan.
I used to be a big fan.  I really like Freddie Mercury.  Are you?
Wow! I didn't know that.  I wonder if he had to write a song for Elvis?  That would be a good honor, but I don't think he would write aSong for Elvis.  That's not a good honors.
Yes he wrote a little tribute to Elvis, a crazy little thing called Love Me or Nothing for 5 minutes or something, I think.  It was a tribute to him and wrote about a crazy Little Things called Love You.
Wow, that is awesome!  I love that song!  Elvis was really blond, I didn't know that!
Wow, I had no idea! I do remember when he had jet black hair, I don't remember him having a other idea.
I wonder if he had to dye it a color, blond Elvis lol, he is that color. It was great chatting with you! I need to go dye mine now!
You too, and I'm going to look into music.  It's crazy that even Elvis only failed one class in HS and it was music.
Wow so crazy! He should have showed them, he could have passed. Well I think I have to get going, enjoy your day!
Are you a fan of rock music?
I love it.  It is my favorite
I didn't realize it was so popular when I graduated, lol.  I grew up in Oklahoma and didn't really realize how popular it was until I graduated.  One of the first songs I ever learned was "Flame on the Lips" which is the state rock song of Oklahoma.  lol
I didnt know that either.  I think Florida has one too.  Do you know if that is in Florida?
Me either lol. I like the waves,  walking on Sunshine by katrina,  or waves, lol.
Maybe. Whitesnake has been in history since the 80's and have had members in every other member throughout its history.
Oh wow, I never knew that, that's a lot! That's funny because Whitesnake used to have such a big arena rock show.
That would have been cool.  I think they are coming to Florida next year in a few, they are going to Dream Theater in the southeast, I think it is going to be coming to the Dream Theater.
Nice!  I like that band too.  I have been to Chicago State before, but it's been a long time since I went there.  They have a good music history and are a good time.  It is funny how a Hanson song (Queensryche and Fates Warning) was the most requested song by Chicago State DJs in the early 90s, even though Hanson was already a Chicago band.  One of the most demanded music CDs was Queen's "Queensyrche and fates warning" music.
that is awesome!  thats so odd,  I guess it was a good song if people kept requesting it,  that is good song though.
I know, Elvis is the only reason I don't think I like it.  I think he was much older than that.
I never cared for him, but I know he failed music class and he did not like it so he failed
I never knew that either lol I also didn't know that he was naturally blonde and dyed his hair black. I knew he was blonde and dyeed his hair, but not black.
I always thought his hair was naturally black but I wonder what prompted him to dye it?
I don't know, I've been learning all kinds of things..  all the time.  lol  Kurt Russell is the voice of Elvis.  I've heard him in Forrest Gump.  Did you see Forrest GUMP?  lol
Freddie Mercury wrote Crazy Little Thing called Love in the Last 20 Minutes which is a tribute to him.  It is the only song he ever did.  Freddie Mercury wrote
I never heard that, but I knew that his daughter Lisa Marie was married to both Michael Jackson and Nicholas Cage.  I never heard of them, either.
I never knew that, I didn't know she was married to Jackson, Cage is also in Cage?
I don't remember that.  I don't know much about tabloids either.  lol  I can't believe there are more libraries than there are grocery store aisles in the US.
I dont use them as much, I end up buying a lot of books.
I buy a lot more books than I should, I used to buy a few cds to save money and then DVDs to save, but I have been using DVDs since the early 80's. I still buy a ton of books.  It used to be McDonalds used to have a lot of libraries that would have a ton more books, but now they don't have alot.
Yes, there are more library cards than there are adults that have library cards.
Good thing we are using libraries to save money!  I told people to use libraries toSave money, not eat dinner!  Anyway, I loved the chat!
Thanks again!  It was great!  Enjoy dinner!
Hello there, are you a fan of rock music?
Yes, I am.  I like the grunge era.  What about you?
lol  I grew up with a good dose of that in college.  I remember Hanson.  Funny how a Chicago alt-rock band (the band) became the most requested song on the radio in the 1990s because of grunge style.  lol  I'm sure it was a good way to get a good doses of that.  Do you remember Hanson?  I think they were a Chicago Alt-Rock band.  LOL
I vaguely remember Hanson, but have no idea who they are.  That sounds like a cool lesson for a class though, amazing!  I had a lesson about rock history including the history of Elvis and Bill Monroe in my rock and roll class.
I know right!  lol  All this rock talk and I still can't work Elvis out... he dyed his hair black.  He was naturally blonde but he dyed it.  lol
I literally did not know that.  I had no inkling about that!
Elvis' daughter Lisa was married to both Michael Jackson and Nicholas Cage.
I knew she was married to Jackson, but not Cage.  Wasn't that before the progressive rock era, or before the Progressive Rock era?
I did not realize that either.  lol  The state rock song of Oklahoma, "Flame Lips" is actually the state song oflahoma.
lol, I will google it!  I can't believe that.  The provincial song of Alberta is "Rodeo Song", too bad it's not the rodeo song of Alaska.
lol  Whitesnake has a history of doing crazy names.  They had like 20 members in their history.
Nah, I'm from arkansas not alberta, nah, and yeah I think I know that funny song lol, I wonder what a ten Whitesnake sounds like? There are some Whitesnakes tribute bands, and one in ark Arkansas.
lol  Elvis was into music too.  Ironically, he failed one class because he failed the class.  lol
Are you an Elvis fan?  I am.  I think that creative people who fail subjects in school wind up in other fields.  Creative people who failed subjects inSchool wind up doing well in other Fields.
Yes, I am a big fan.  I like his earlier stuff the best, like Forrest Gump.  Kurt Russell did the voice of Elvis in Forrest GUMP, and I think that was the best he ever did.  He is the best!  How about you?
Yeah, and I like his earlier stuff too.  Imo he was a rockabilly pioneer way back then, not just a glorified lounge singer.  He was a much better rockabiller pioneer, imO.
I love that he was a lounge singer.  lol  Freddie Mercury of Queen wrote a tribute to Elvis and called it a tribute.  Crazy to think about.  I think rockabilly is my favorite era of lounge singer/singer.  LOL
LOL, I remember being in high school and sitting in the car with my best friend from that class drinking southern comfort.  He was the muscle car music of his day, sitting next to me on the car radio.  I remember sitting in my high school class drinking Southern comfort and listening to the radio, lol.  The radio played the same songs over and over again every morning.
Nice. I miss muscle cars too!  I need to check out some copies of Elvis' cds at our local library.  I think I'll check them out at the library. It was fun chatting with you!  Have a nice day!
I think your library has a good cd selection.  Nice chatting with you!
Have a great day!  Thanks!
Do you know anything about Elvis Presley?
I do, I remember him from the movies from his time, but do not remember much else of his movies
It is important to know that a lot of people do not know that he is so important. He widened the musical interest. I do not listen to him but I know a lot.
It's cool that Freddie Mercury of the band Queen, wrote the song "crazy little thing called Love Yourself" in tribute to Elvis.  He wrote it in just 2 minutes and 17 seconds, and wrote the "Crazy Little Thing" as a tribute to Presley.
I think that Van Zandt's initiative is a teahc that will succeed, I really think that rock music important historically, still relevant today and I think that teahC will be relevant today as well.
I agree with you there, its funny though, that in his music class Presley failed.
That is funny, he was a kid at the time and probably thought music was boring.  Elvis was the best.  He did over 200 shows as a kid, that is too many shows for one class!
True. Did you know that he dyed black hair to look like a natural blonde? He thought it looked better than natural blonde.
I know it's surprising, I didn't think naturally blonde would dye his hair black. It's surprising to think that even today someone who is naturally blonde will dye his Hair black.
Lisa Marie Presley (formerly Lisa Marie) was her daughter's name.  Her daughter married both Michael Jackson and Nicolas cage.
That's how they met.  She is very popular, I wonder how her father and he met.
I agree. There are more libraries than McDonalds in the US. I wonder why there is less libraries than Mcdonalds?
That's encouraging to know. It's a country that has so many people that need a book and not just medias like dvds and other medias.
I'm curious to know as well, I would think they are more than that. In Sacramento there is a library of things where you can check out sewing machines, I think that is a good idea as long as people return it and not use it, I'm curious about the library of Things in DC where you could check out Sewing Machines, I don't know if it's a good Idea as longAs people return them
That is a great idea! I think people are responsible for what they use and the tools they use so it is a good time of the year for them to do that.
That's true.  I think it's encouraging that more Americans are getting a library card than ever before.  It seems like so many Americans do not have a library cards.
Yeah, I think I would like to go to the library more often.
I went with my mother last week, she went to a local library for her mother last month, I don't go a lot, but I went to one in a senior community, not a huge library but a great one, it's for the senior community
A prisoner studied law in the prison library to prove his innocence, what kind of book did he read at the library to do that?  A prisoner studied Law in the library of the library and read from the library in the jail to prove he was not a prisoner.  What kind of BOOK is that?
I like auto biographies, mysteries and true crime, and some auto biographical.
Same here. I like 18th century fiction, theDickens and Balzac and some 19th century novel.
do you like star wars?
Hi there, I do like star wars, do you?
I loved it. didnt have money for it but it changed my view of film for the better. Star Wars has been a seminal event in my life.
Absolutely agree, the original star wars had such a major impact, George Lucas' back then wife was in it too, I believe.
Yes and she even won an Oscar for her talent for story!  Lucky for him, he met a partner who was as well lucky as him.
That is incredible. I didn't know that. 20th century fox believed that star wars was going to be a flop. I guess they were right.
Yeah, that was a strange film in my imagination. I think that the execs at the time just did not knew what they were doing. It was a different time and a strange movie for sure, but they knew what was out there.
It was a strange film. I like fantasy films.
Lots of religion and mysticism, space fantasy, science fiction, and lots of religion.
Do you like fantasy films by any chance?
Not really, I follow the books.. but the lotr series is one of the best.  It is hard to realize the books.  that doesnt work on the screen.  There are fans of the books, but not so much the screen,  that is why.
Apparently, Dalmatians are a fantasy film. That's surprising. I know that Dalmatian's are borderline on the borderline between a fantasy and a fantasy.
I can't imagine that, I haven't seen that film in forever, I do like dogs!
I guess Jim Henson also created some fantasy stuff too.
I dont remember much about the dark crystal.  I dont think he did.  He was a creative guy.
I believe he created it because he wanted to return the fantasy genre to its darker roots.  He wanted toReturn to its roots.
The dark scary part is important for children. stories explore the most important part of life, the fears, the unreal space. and the dark part is necessary.
I agree, did you watch Game of Thrones? I feel like I can see how it could be considered a fantasy genre, I agree,
I do, I am looking forward to the last season, it's the last year or so and then it's on to the next season, man I cant believe it's already been going on for a year already! Anyway, great chat!
Great chatting with you too, suggestions for fantasy films?
Princess Bride is a comedy classic!  Have a great day!
I have seen it, but not that one.
Thanks! I'm going to look into it now.
Bye! :) ;) 
Hello there, do you like fantasy films? Its one of my favorite genres.
I like them too!  The Lord of the Rings was a good one, I thought.
I did, it was good, I think it won best picture in 1977
Yeah, did you know it was the first fantasy film to do so?
Jim Henson created a dark film called the dark crystal that was upbeat.  I am surprised it was the only one.
Yeah I guess he thought it would scared the kids and that would be unhealthy.  I noticed a bit of darkness in the sesame street that I was watching today.  Bert and Iernie are in the pyramid.  They are scared of the darkness and the little kids.
They have a fan convention for the stars, pretty crazy and lucrative, they are stars and there is even a fan conventions
I have not. How much do the stars make?
Well they can make anywhere from $700,000 to $120,000 per weekend, and they can even make more if they want to
Wow, that is pretty cool! It must be good to break into that routine! It is pretty neat.
Yep, the thief of the cobbler and the thief.  Some movies are so time-consuming, like the c Cobbler that took 15 years to make!
Wow! It's interesting how that works since technology has really advanced a lot over the years but I think that is very interesting.
It must, it was made with real actors and it was animated.
That's what I thought too! I have always wondered about that. I have seenPieced together animation so many times.
Game of Thrones is another great fantasy show!
No I haven't seen Game of Thrones yet. I guess it is pretty good but it doesn't really hold my attention. I do like Arya though.
I think it is, I think it was the first baby names to be popular.
Yeah, I heard it is the fastest rising new baby name
Yes, it boosts tourism and the likes. Ireland even finances the series.
Interesting. I've never watched Game of Lions but I want to. Have you seen the game "The lives of lions"?
I have not. I heard it was by Charlie Chaplins granddaughter. I have not seen Game of Thrones. I wonder how it is doing.
I did not know that, did you know Harry Lloyd is the great great great grandson of charles dickens and the greatGreat great great Great grandson of harry lloyd?
Do you watch fantasy films?
I love fantasy films and books, one of my favorite things to read or watch, do you?
Nice.  I love Game of Thrones.  Loved Lord of the Rings and also love Game Of Thrones!
Yep I read the Song of Ice series before Game of Thrones started but I never got around to it. I didn't think my GRRM would finish book 3 of the Lord of the Rings after watching the movies. But man the show is amazing.
Harry Lloyd who played Viserys Targaryen is the great great great grandson of Charles Dickens and the greatGreat great grandsonof the great Great great great Great grandson of Dickens.
Yes, I believe it.
Hmmm,  no,  I haven't.  What was it about?
Yeah!  I was in the middle of typing and just accidentally hit enter.  I think I was asking about Westworld, I really liked it and it was good, but I can't say that I've ever seen it.  Did you see it?
I have not.  I know alot about it, Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter is in it.  It's a famous connection.  Who knew those fact were in a tv show?
Singer Ed Sheeran, who was in the first episode of Game of Thrones, was in it. He was in a group of guys sitting around a fire singing in season 1.
I remember reading about that show before.  It's called Game of Lions.  I think I remember reading it was about the lives of lions, or at least the lives in the national geographic wild.  Maybe it's called game of lions for the TV characters. lol
Interesting, the lions would work well in the show. I like that show, I have seen it a few times so it must be pretty good.
I've never been able to watch it. I am intrigued by the film scenes that are financed by Ireland since it boosts tourism incomes there. I wonder if it is financed by having them film scenes there.
It's pretty crazy that Ireland pays for that, and that people subscribe to HBO, it makes a ton of money, it's one of the most expensive shows on television, so I'm sure it makes up for that. It's also pretty crazy how many people subscribe, I wonder how many more people subscribe in the US.
I think they work with people that they can get on with.  Are you a star wars fan?  I am.  I don't know much about it, but I know that they work well together.
I love the original 3, the Force Awakens is my favorite, and I think that Luke's skywalkers death in the Force Awakens was the best one, in my opinion. The prequels were kind of meh, the Last Jedi was terrible, but not as bad as people say, but I love the originals, the prequel ones were kindOf meh as well, in the opinion.
I agree with you at some points.  Luke really died.  I was curious to know how he did it.  The entire franchise has a box office of over 7 billion dollars at the box office.  So I was a little curious to see how it would all wrap up with that episode.
Yeah they make money hand over fist, and I'm feeling a lot of that is due to nostalgia from older generations who loved the originals.
Yes.  The entire franchise is valued at $65 billion and does not include the 3rd and 4th movies.
Yeah, it's sad that they've made so much in the long run, but I think it's also sad that the guy that did the voice of Chewbaca, Peter Mayhew, who was voicing the character in the original originals, got pretty screwed up in the royalties he got for it being valued so high, and he was the guy who made only $7500 for voicing the Character, not the royalties that they made when they made the originals
Yikes!  I know right,  I can't believe it!  It was fun chatting with you today!  Hope the rest of your day is great,  have a great one!
Hey how's it going. How about you? I personally like the star wars franchise but don't know much about the rest of the series personally.
I love them! I'm more of the sci-fi type of movies like Solo and Deadpool, not so much a super hero/sci-fi.
I like the Star Wars movies personally, Lucas is such a genius, and he gave up all his licensing rights for a directing fee for the Deadpool movie and he became a billionaire after that, he gave himself a $1M directing fee and he is the genius of the Star wars movies personally
Wow that is incredible, I guess it paid off for him! I wonder how much he got for Unlock Al Pacino, I know that he was going to do a role for Han Solo but it turned into a role of his own, I Guess his career took off after that, I wonder what he would have done if he had to unlock Al Pacinos name, I mean I guess his career would have taken off,
Yeah but I think he did just fine haha. It's interesting that Star Wars was the first to be dubbed into Navajo, and the first Star Wars to be chosen for a major language but an interesting one nonetheless. I wonder why they chose it was dubbed into Navajo, I wonder if it was because it was the only language that was chosen or if it is just a fine name for it.
That is cool.  Evidently Christopher Walken was considered for the role of Han Solo, but he did not want to do it.  I think it would have been cool.
LOL  I did not know that.  I wish Leia good luck in the Death Star, George Lucas's wife, Marcia Lucas, made the original Star Wars film good.
That's crazy! I didn't know that! I did know that the guy who played Poe in The Force Awakens, evidently they were going to let him do the Yavin 5 scenes, but he insisted on not doing it. I wonder if that was to shed light on Guatemala, where the YA scenes were filmed. I think it was to help the guy, who played Poe.
Yeah that's nice, I wonder if it was Harrison Ford LOL, I know that George Lucas wantedHan Solo to be a black man so they could try making his character the only black man on the planet, but George Lucas Wanted Han Solo to look like Harrison Ford lol
That's funny thinking about it.  I would have liked him as a large green alien.  Chewbacco is a life, a way of life, and a companionship for a while.  Jaba the hut is a very old hut.  Maybe he was a large Green alien?
Good question.  haha  I think it is interesting that Han Solo only got started in the movies when he was only 18 and started to fly the Millennium Falcon.  That was the original tie fighter.  Interesting that Han solo was able to fly it.
Yeah it is an origin story in Solo, a lot of the way they worked it out was that he was an imperial lieutenant, a whole lot different from what the original movies were.
Yep that's true. Did you see that movie, Deadpool 2?
I didn't see the second part, but I know Ryan Reynolds crossed over from shar-pei to dc for the first one.  I suppose the creator Deadpool thought that was the best part.  Reynolds is perfect for him.
Haha that's awesome! I'm glad they got him to play the role! I think it's funny that the villain is Ryan Reynolds and the mystery voice of the Deadpool is actually Deadpool himself! It's interesting that he's the only one to play him in the comic, I'm not sure if I remember right but I'm sure he's one of the few that did. I think the mystery villain is Deadpool himself, I think he was the mysteryvoice of the comic and he did play the Role of the villain, I wonder why he did that, I would think it would have been someone else, it's really funny!
Yeah I think it was Ryan Reynolds, he and the screenwriters are a great team, the second one is actually the highest grossing r-rated movie of all time and it's also by ryan reynolds, so I think he did a great job,
Did you ever play the Deadpool video game? Apparently it cost a lot to play the Deadpool video game. I've never played the game but that's a lot more like the movie in terms of the humor and violence.
I never did, but I do like Deadpool. I think it's better than the movie to be honest.
The original Deadpool movie was really good too, but it took a long time to get a script in place. James Cameron and David Fincher (two famous directors who also helped the original Deadpool) are building a new building. The new script will be good, but not as good as the first one.
Yeah, I know they are friends with Tim Miller. Deadpool 2 is directed by him but he left early in the project due to creative differences.  He was also friends with Deadpool 1 and 2, but left this project due for the creative differences
Yeah that's interesting, but I think the original director had that same or exact issue with the first one, it just got worse since he got rid of the original Director.
Hi, are you a Star Wars fan?
Oh yeah,  I am!  How about you?
I am impartial, but I admire the creator George Lucas, for his boldness and creativity to think outside the box and create a successful empire.
Yeah I agree, he created something that is pretty intense these days, it's pretty intense now.
Yeah, he is a genius! He convinced the film studios back in the 80s to get with him on a deal to forgo all his licensing and merchandising rights and directing fees for a flop thereby agreeing to a deal that would pay him $500,000 per movie he convinced them to flop.
Yeah that was a good move, I wonder how much it would be worth today if they thought it was going to be a good one, the franchise is now worth what it is worth today
It recently became known as Navajo for Native American. I wonder if it's because they could offer the film in numerous languages worldwide.  They would dub it in Navajo because it's the only language that understood English better than English.
Yeah, I think so too. That's so cool! They also used James Earl Jones to record Darth Vaders lines for the film. He's been in the game so long he got to be able to record all of them.
I do not know how long, but I guess it was close to a year, right?
I guess its over 10 and half hours of work, and I was only paid $7.5k for 2 and a half hours. Good money for 2.5 hours but not good money.
My goodness, that's a great paycheck!  I'm not sure how much I'd be making minimum wage.  Maybe the payment was a result of license and merchandise deals that the actor got for the film, or a payment as a result for not making the film.
Yeah, good money. Pacino turned down the role of Han Solo for the role, but then Pacino was right the next time he got the role. He got good money for the job.
I think Pacino regrets that decision now! He was casted after auditioning for the story, and then turn down an offer that insane, I wonder how much he got? I'm more of a Deadpool fan than Star Wars, I'd rather be a DeadpoolFan than Star wars, but who knows...
Yeah I bet he does. Have you seen the newest Deadpool movie?  It's the newest one.
Yes I did! I enjoy his sarcastic sense of humor. It is insane how much money they have to make a movie, I mean it cost more money to make the first movie than the first video game which is insane. Do you play video games at all?
Wow, that is incredible!  I didn't know that,  I don't play them either.  But yeah I think the movie is really fun.  I saw the first superhero movie that was rated R and it was really fun!  It was rated PG-13 though.
Ryan Reynolds did a great job as the voice of the mystery villain. He is doing a great do!
I knew he was a great actor, he is a good person in real life, so yeah and I think he is also a good PERSON in realLife as well.
Yes, he is hilarious in real life. I enjoy his interviews on talk shows. I agree, the casting did a great job for him, I think he did a fine job. He did a good job in casting all of the marvel characters, I like him and I enjoy him.
Yeah! I wonder how many people would have been perfect for those roles? I wonder if people would do it again.
I agree.  The directors are also really good.  James Cameron and David Fincher actually convinced Deadpool director to direct the film.
Yeah that is a good question! Well it was nice taking with you today, it was so nice chatting with you, I hope you have a good day!
Hi, how are you?
Hello, I am well. Are you a fan of Star Wars?
I love star wars. i am a nut for some of the characters.
Yeah, I am not one of the true star wars nuts either, but I enjoy the movies and the films.  What are your favorite of the films?
I like all of the Star Wars, I really like the first one. Do you know when the release date for the next one is?
Yeah, I liked Empire Strikes Back the best of the bunch. I think the Empire Strikes back did not replicate well in the UK.
I'm worried I'm getting overexposed to the new series. I thought Jar Jar Binx killed it in the first movies but I thoughtJar Jar BinX killed it again in the second one.
Yeah that is too bad, I think they re-did the music scene in return for the last Jedi, I liked it better.
Yeah I think I expected that as well, but I thought Solo was average.
I liked Solo and the last Jedi better. Solo has been in theaters for a while and the new ones are busy now. I think they will make more in the next few theaters.
I watched Solo on my own. I saw the last jedi on the netflix, but only parts of it. I think it is too busy for theaters.
Yeah I only saw Solo. I saw previews of the last one. I liked it equally well in both.
I liked Solo, but I thought it had some bad reviews, and lacked some meat. I have a hard time gauging the quality of a movie without seeing Solo, so I have an hard time trying to do that.
Yeah it was good, I'm not a fan of the original three so it's hard for me to say it was any good, but I saw it, it was ok.
No issue there. I like the originals, but comparing them to the new ones is no perfect way to do it.
Yeah I think I feel the same, they were good but they were impossible to replicate.
I'm surprised that Star Wars is the first major film that was dubbed in Native American. I can't believe there has never been a movie that was actually dubbed in Navajo or any other language.
Yeah, it seems so long, but I guess it was the first one.
Yeah, Pacino sure must regret turning down the role now!
I do not, Al Pacino is so iconic that role has no problem for me.
True. Nice chatting with you.
Hi there! Do you watch Star Wars?
I do, by chance.  I love watching Star Wars, I heard the new Han Solo movie is going to be nice in a new way.  It's in addition to the old saga, I think.
Yeah, he was ok. He was Oscar Isaac.
I remember him in the movie, but I don't remember the name of the character.
Yeah he played the role of Poe Dameron and requested to be a native of Yavin 4 because he was a native, and yeah he played The character is the son of a nativeOf Yavin4 and the son-in-law of Poe dameron and requested that he be the name of his character
That is interesting! Did you also know that the director James Cameron used to quit his job as a truck driver to go to Star Wars, and became a truckdriver?
Yeah that's a good one, he's originally from Guatemala where some of the scenes were filmed, so yeah he must have been originally from there
Makes sense, I wonder what happens there, it is told over the course of centuries so the saga of where it occurs is probably told, and how it all came about.
Yeah. James Earl Jones was only paid $7500 and only got paid for the reading of lines for about 2 hours!
I know. Imagine if Bill Murray was in the role of Han Solo. He believed in the project, but I feel that he would have been a completely different character. Can you imagine if Bill had taken the role? He would have become a completely Different character.
I know right, George Lucas' wife was also involved in the movie, she was in one of the scripts for the first one and was involved in all the others too.
Awesome! She was so awesome. She had written fan fiction for the original 1977 one. She even secretly married the Wookie! Han Solo was supposed to be a Wookie.
Yeah I bet someone has, and yeah his wife made some awesome ones too, she won the academy award for best actress, I wonder if she won it, and I wonder why she won
She was also responsible for a successful merchandising franchise, as the movies now hold the record for the most successful merchanded franchise, along with han solo and leia romance
Did you know it was the first major movie dubbed in Navajo?
Yes, that's quite the mix of different accomplishments. It is the second highest grossing film series of all time, and it's the first to do so in Navajo!
That is amazing! I need to watch Deadpool 2 now!
I have but I don't have much interest in the character. I know Marvel Comics is owned by Fox, which is confusing because they are owned by fox news.
I know right. Apparently Deadpool describes himself as a sharpei, and Ryan Reynolds crossed over from the UK.
Ryan Reynolds is an interesting mix of characters.  The last movie made by him was 15 years before the first movie made with Rene Reynolds.
Yeah, he believed he was destined for that role. Nice chat.
Hello.  Did you know Panda researchers are going to be in panda costumes.  I think it's cute.
I have not seen the pandas. I always assumed that those were just my pandas, but they sure bee realistic.
They are adorable. They make me smile. Johnny Depp in his Jack Sparrow costume, traveling in a Jack Sparrow outfit, to visit sick kids.
I feel that is kind of creepy, I wonder how he would feel about doing that. He did an impromptu visit to a hospital once with a pirate and a willy wonka, kind of like Willy Wonka.
He probably was not thrilled to be in the Captain Jack role.
I think he is going to do well.  I think he hauls that costume around with the make-up artist in tow and does his face.  He is a little mean when he hauling around his costume.
lol  I think he has to put on eyeliner, he has been in hollywood long enough to be able to put it on.  He's been in Hollywood long enough.
I think I understand art more than I understand music and painting. I know make-up artistry, literature, literature and the olympics.
Maybe in the olympics, but it was in the Olympics in 1904 when Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature!
I would be surprised if he painted too. Not as surprised as a multi gold winner like Michael Phelps, who has been a multi Gold winner like 6 times!
Could have been. Did you know the FDA burned six tons of literature when they burned six ton of novels in the 1950s?  Can you read a book a day?
I would hazard a guess that it was during the fifties.  These days there are no moral panics because of the books six tons represents so many books six ton represents too many.  I think kids should be able to read, even if it's just a little.
Good question.  I think it's fascinating that romantic kissing is rarely ever mentioned in the ancient Greek literature and they invented debauchery.  It's like they didn't think to think about what we do now.  Kissing is rarely mentioned even in ancient Greek Literature.
I wonder how debauchery got its name, those days, I can't see wearing those togas, that would be debauche!
Yes, that would wind up being the costume her cousin used for her Doc's Holiday.  It was one of the costumes they wore in the old west when they went to west with the costumes and the wind.
Good or bad costumes, it was a smash. The biggest movie of all time, inflation adjusted, and was the biggest movie ever, so it's probably good or bad costume.
It's interesting her parents were from the south lost all of their ten and a half and she was the only one from the South.
I know, that's the kind of thing you bring up when you live in the south, the kind you bring into a sheltered time.
I would have loved to go to the festival where 3rd Wind was released.
It was the perfect time! I would have dressed up in an authentic costume, like Leo tally whip, dressed up as him.
I'm getting the kids ready for bed, thanks for chatting.  Have a wonderful night.
Hi, how are you? Do you like literature?
I love books! I know the FDA once burned tons of books!
That is crazy! Tons? That's censorship for you?
Yes it is. There is a contest every year to come up with the worst opening sentence in a novel, I wonder who will come upwith it. It must be really bad.
Yeah that is fun.  Did you know that Churchil won a nobel prize in literature?
No, I didn't know that, I think that was back in 1953, he must have been a pretty talented guy.
Yes he was. Literature is also part of the Olympic games
Yeah and the others were music, painting and sculpture
Yeah. romantic kissing is hard to find in ancient iterature
Yes that is a new development in literture
I wonder how they find the same works in ancient Greek.
Yeah exactly. I wonder if Panda researchers wear panda costumes?
That's pretty cool.. Sean bean is scared of flying so he hiked a mountain in costume for recordings.
Yes for the filming of lord of the rings.
Yeah, Johnny Depp wears the jack sparrow costume and visits kids in the hopsital
Nice, he does that all the time I like it.
Did you know that the hoggle costume got lost in shipping for the movie labyrinth?
Did you know that there is an unclaimed baggage museum in Alabama?
Yeah nice. Did you see the movie The Last Wind?
I haven't seen it.  Have you read it?  Is it a movie or is it a book?
I did see it last year, I liked it.
Hi, how are you?
hey there, I'm good, do you know who Nelson Mandela is?
I don't know too much about him, who is he?
He is an interesting one. I think he has a documentary on him in fashion.
I wonder if there is going to be a documentary on that.  He is so acute!
I love how Talley has a moral code to dress in.  I think this is a genration of the moral code that has been taken into consideration.
yeah, they should wear it if you supervise young staff.
Yeah that is a sure thing,  the people that would wear disrespectful clothes,  show no respect,  and it would definitely not be a work environment for them lol,  I don't like to see people who would wear disrespectful clothes in a work situation.
Yeah, I can't believe the FDA would burn their clothes.  I wonder if they do that with tons of literature too?
The FDA and the literature? lol.
Not sure, I do know that Churchill won a nobel prize in literature though.
He was a brilliant man! Funny how romantic kissing in literature is a modern development, it's funny how romantic kisses are a modernDevelopment
It is!  It was an olympic event from 1912-1952!  I didn't know that until recently, until recently.  Literature is all around us in our life.
Yeah, can you imagine watching someone designing a building on abc? LOL.
I hear the snooty ones say, " impecibly built...post moderism at its finest... great lines... Impecibly Built!"  Post moderism, at its best.
Hahahaa! Yeah, yeah, yeah... I can! I wonder if they would have commentated by joe buck!
Yes, he is the commentator that I like. He would pick up the show nicely.
You are right.  I would not want to be a Panda researcher.  lol  I don't think I could go out in a panda costume to work, lol
I thought it would make wearing the costume a lot less awkward.
It's awesome how Johnny Depp makes surprise visits to sick kids in hospitals.
Yeah! Nice chatting with you!
Hey there, do you like literature at all?
Yeah, I love to read.  I found out the FDA burned 6 tons of literature in order to censor it.  That makes me mad, the FDA makes me MAD.
That is so sad.  The person that writes the worst opening sentence in a competition always gets to wins.  I wonder who the person is.  Who is the person that write the worst?
Yes, I heard about that.  Did you know that Sir Winston Churchill won a nobel prize in lit in 1953 for his peace?
That guy must be really smart. He had his hands in so much!
Amazing!  He was great at using the wind, that's for sure.  He could read almost like the wind.  Amazing!
No, I haven't read it. I loved that book. It is a university course I took at my university. Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.
I love books! Scarlett is one of my all time favorite characters, she is based on one written by Margaret Mitchell, from South Park, written by her, and I love books from the South.
Kissing was first mentioned in ancient greek literature and was a work of literature that even won the Olympic medal.
I did not. I wonder if that was before or after the movie, "The Last Movie"? Supposedly it sold so many tickets that it took over 40 million, more than the population of the US at the time of the movie itself, and then some!  I wonder how many of those tickets were from " The Last Movie".
That does not make sense. That is strange!  I wonder if people that were visiting bought tickets?  It would make sense if they were from there.
I know people have seen the movie numerous times and have seen it.  It was the highest grossing film of 2014.  They must adjust for inflation if you adjust for all the other movies that have been released.
Yeah that makes sense. The mayor of Atlanta even declared it a festival when the movie was released, and the mayor of atlanta even declared a whole festival for it.
Very cool.  I think it's crazy that the Bible is the favorite book of American readers.  What is your favorite book?
I wonder how far it will reach in the US. Did you know that Panda researchers wear Panda costumes?
I did not.  When Johnny Depp brings his Jack Sparrow costume with him when he travels, he will visit sick kids in the hospital and surprise them with a visit.  I wonder if that was the same when he brings his jack sparrow costume to the hospital when he was sick in the 80s?
That is so nice of him! I heard that his daughter was really sick and the hospital managed to save her, shes not the best character, but shes a good character.  I wonder if the hospital manages to save many of the kids?
Wow, I didn't know that. I love costumes from movies, and I saw there's a museum in Alabama that has Hoggle's costume. I wonder if he has seen it? I love costume's, did you know that the Labyrinth was lost in shipping and only returned when it was unclaimed baggage at a museum? I wonder how it was returned, and why, I wonder why the Labyrinth wasn't in the costume, maybe it was lost because it was in unclaimed luggage or something?
I guess more people go to that musem then.
True!  What is weird is that we call a swim suit a swimming costume.  How funny is that?  I don't see how that is possible.  Why do we call something we call A swim suit  a swimming suit?
Things have changed so much!  It was nice chatting with you!
Hey, do you watch tennis?
I do like tennis, Serena Williams is playing well, what about you?
Did you know that Polo shirts were first used for tennis player.
I was thinking that it was Polo players.
Apparently, it was Rene Lacoste.
A black man won the tennis title in 1968?
Strange. Apparently there was one open in 1969 where it rained so much they had to use a helicopter to dry off.
I can't believe that!  Using a helicopter for something as simple as drying a field?
I think it was the propeller mocing so fast that removed the water drops.
I can't imaging a tennis match going on for 12 hours a day for 24 hours spread over 3 days, 24 hours a week.
The players would be exhausted at the end, I think.
Yes I'm sure they were!  Do you remember Billie Jean King?  She was a good tennis player.
No I do not.  I used to watch a few of the games that Serena plays in.  Do you ever watch any of the other games that Beyona plays in?
I have seen a few games, Serena has the arm strength, but her sister has the most arm strength of any one of them all.
She is very smart and speak fluent French and Italian as well.
I wonder if they speak each other's languages?
Serena is also a co-owner of Miami Dolphins
I was surprised to hear that. I thought her mind was more closely focused on tennis, but I thought she was focused on Tennis.
Yeah, she won her first grand slam while pregnant in 2001 and then won her 2nd place.
I am not surprised she played while she was pregnant, she can stop at will. I am proud of her and surprised she didn't stop while she is pregnant.
Yes, and her baby was born a champion! Nice chatting with you!
Hello, did you know that the highest point on the moon is 1936 meters higher than mount everest, which is 1938 meters higher!
The largest natural satellite of our solar system, it is flat and crater filled.
The moon of Saturn is also known as Titan.  There is evidence of methane based life on the moon of saturn.
That's fascinating! I would imagine that we'll finally find definitive proof of life.
It would be cool.  Are you a movie fan?  I am.
I am! I didn't realize he was born in 1984, Leonardo DiCaprio. I didn'
Tom Hanks is only 5 years older than him and is the highest all time box-office star.  He is only 30 years older too!
I wish I was older than you!  I like Tom Hanks but I would not pretend to be the highest box office earner is crazy.  He has made some memorable films and is much older than me.  But he is the highest Box office earning is crazy!
He has over $8.5 billion in worldwide film earnings.
I cannot imagine money like that.  Silence of the Lambs was a date movie and it premiered on Valentine's Day.  It was the first date movie ever to do so, so imagine money for a movie that premiered on February 1!
I think it is a date movie. I think that Disney is killing it. Back in the 90s, Treasure Planet was one of the most expensive flops of all time. I like all the Marvel movies, but Disney is kill it. It's not a treasure planet, but it was a expensive flop.
I wonder if the movies are any better now? Disney animated movies have done well. They considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty was a box office failure.
Hey, you mentioned Leonardo Dicaprio earlier.  Those growing pains helped launch his career.  I think you are right, those growing pains.
Growing pains helped many of the actors who went on to have a career. Brad Pitt and Matthew Perry are two of them.
Never knew that. Dicaprio is producing a new Twilight Zone movie, I believe.
I would be interested in that, I think he has won a golden globe for it. It was sad that it didn't win any awards.
ya that is crazy, I figured he would have had more awards, how can he only get 2 awards, crazy right?
I think Marlon Brando's Oscar was for best Actor.  He was the first to turn down one from the government.
Yes, he starred in The revenant
Man in the Wilderness was the first film he was in. The remake of the remake was not well done.
I did not see that one.  Well,thanks for the chat!  You as well,thanks again.
Good Morning. Do you watch tennis at all? I recently learned that the longest tennis match in history lasted 11 days.
I dont usually watch it,  I know who is playing but sometimes its hard to follow who they are playing.
Yes I agree, it is hard to follow.  Reminds me of polo shirts, which were invented by a tennis player for tennis.  The game was not invented for a tennis game.
I did not. I'm not a fan of polo shits, but for fun, I always assumed that they were invented for tennis. I have never been a fan either of polos. I am not a great fan of Polo shits myself.
I think tennis was actually invented by a tennis player, Rene Lacoste at one time, and later adopted by polo players. Makes sense, it was invented for tennis.
Hey I knew Lacoste was the one, but not the one with the alligator shirts!
I like shirts like those. Speaking of popular shirts, have you heard of Serena Williams? She's one of the top ranked female tennis players.
Yea, she was born in 1983, she is from the Miami Dolphins I think.  She was always a superstar when I was younger, or so I thought.
I guess she was a tennis player too, so I guess she is a business.  I thought it was cool that she owns a football team too.
I feel like most sports stars start their own business when they get money, I feel like it's the only way to get money. She's wayyyyy too old for that though.
Serena is surprising. She is great at tennis but speaks french and itialian.
Yes and her sister is also really well known.
I don't know, but she was an overachiever. She won a grand slam tournament when she was pregnant, which is impressive.
I was shocked to see her play. Do you like her play?
I am not surprised. I thought it might be dangerous to let her play. She played like a baby and did not drop a single set. I am surprised she didn't even drop one.
I wouldve expected her to be ranked somewhere in the world like 3rd or 4th, but apparently she is now ranked No. 1, so higher I guess, I wouldveexpected her to have been higher
She was always a confident woman so I think that's why she could challenge and beat any man ranked anywhere from 0 to 100.  Even though she was low, she reported that she was able to beat anyMan ranked 200 or worse in tennis.
Haha her hubris in that situation I guess.  That must have been really awkward haha
I guess. I think he probably gave her some encouragement though and once she reached a ranking of number 1 in 2001 she gave him some encouragement.
I hope she does, she's one of the greats, she has beaten Maria Sharapova and many others so I hope she can do better.
Yes, the only other women ranked below her in the ranking is Steffi Graf and martina navratilova.
Did you know polo shirts were originally invented for a tennis player?
Noway, that's cool.  Did you ever watch Serena Williams?  She was talented and unstoppable.
Yea, Serena Williams has been ranked number 1 so many times in the WTA, ranked number one 8 times in 2017 alone!
Wow, that's superwoman. I recently heard that she's part co owner of the Miami Dolphins. I had no idea she was, I had the idea she's a part coOwner of the Dolphins.
Yea Williams is a pretty good player, she was on the rankings for like 9 weeks straight and now she is out of the rankings
Wow, she is very good. I guess some people consider grunting when you are trying to get a shot off as a form of cheating.
ya they do, they also used a helicopter to help dry the grass for the US Open, that sound annoying, they had to dry the tennis court with it, I wonder if that was for the tennis
Yeah that does sound gross, I agree, and yes I agree with you.  I do know an amazing fun fact about tennis, Serena went pro in 2 years, that is how old she was when she went pro, and it does sound Gross, but it is an amazingfun fact.
I think the longest match in tennis history is 11 hours!  How is the game close?  Is the game's close to that?
WOW, that is a marathon. I heard it was the longest rally, I think it was 11 shots in one heck of a rally. One of the longest shots ever was the one for the longest Rally.
That's pretty crazy. The first black man to ever win the Open was won in 1968!  I wonder who it was?
Wow that was a long time ago!  The longest rally was 11 mins and 17 seconds.
I know right!    Did you know that the tennis player Gael Monfils beat the best paddle tennis players days after learning how to play?   I wonder if that was in tennis playersDays after learning, the tennis players Gael MonFils beat one of the best paddled tennis players?
oh my gosh, I don't know how he did that, but I guess he must have been good! Do you play any sport? I heard ping pong is also called ping pONG but table tennis officially is better called pingpong. I think that would be more fun.
Yea, Serena Williams won a 3 grand slam while two months pregnant, and that was when she was six months pregnant
Noway!  That's crazy that she was 2 months and still hugging her racket!  I'm sure that reminds her of the Katy Perry song "I'm Gonna Be There"  I think that was her song, it was about hugging her own racket!
I wonder what album Katy Hudson is from, I like her debut songs from her debut albums.
I think it was the  hear me roar song from that album.
Crazy Russel Brand ended his marriage with Perry through a text message.
Oh my gosh, yeah!  That seems cold hearted.  That's weird.  Katy is such a weirdo.  She tied Michael Jackson to a weirdoing, cold heartedly cold Christian singer who was not an official "church" singer to begin with and then moved on to pop music when she moved to LA.  Did you know she has tied Michael jackson to her on an album?
Nice chatting with you!  Have a nice one.
Hi. Do you like tennis?
I love tennis, I used to play it a lot when I was a kid, do you play?
I've played the sport a couple of times, but never really got the score right, seems complicated. I'm not sure how complicated it is.
Yes, the scoring is kind of weird, but theres no object you can use like a tennis racket, but you can't use any other object as a racket.
lol  That's really strange, I've heard they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open,  how is that even handled when so many people show up?  They used a Helicopter to dry The Grass tennis courts?  lol
haha that is a good idea, I think! That is weird, also weird that tennis is the most popular sport in the US but it makes more money than all other sports combined, soccer, soccer and then tennis, not sure if that is good idea
Soccer is easy to do well because it's a flat area. You can play with a ball and a flatArea, no special equipment, and no ball.
Good point!  Thinking back to tennis, the longest point was a rally that lasted 11 minutes!  That's exhausting.  That was a really long rally, and thinking back to a rally of 17 minutes, the only point I can think of is the one rally that lasts 11 minutes.
I imagine that the fans would have collapsed.
Yep I'm sure they made it through one tire, but I think they had to let the shot rally back in.  Did you know that one player grunts while theyre playing and it's a form of cheating, I wonder how many player grunt and then do the shot, I know it's made a little more likely if a player grunts while they're playing but I wonder why? I wonder if it's like a formof cheating
I do think that when some people make noise it can be.  I don't watch the game, so I can see it, but it shows intensity.  But grunting is a way to show that they are getting by.  It sounds vulgar and classless to the elites that play.  People make noise because they want to be heard, not because they have to.  The grunting, though, sounds like a way of getting by for the elites.
Yep I agree. I don't know if I would make it, it doesn't seem like a natural sound, but it's definitely different than what Serena Williams does.
I think she has worked hard for her success and is a success.  I heard she wants to retire because she is tired of tennis.  She must be tired of practicing and is tired.
That's impressive.  She was born in 1977, so it makes her almost 40 years older than me.  That makes her so incredibly old for tennis lol, she was like 5 years older when she was born.
I guess she was young, but involved at that level.  I wonder how many players are able to get to that level in their lifetime and still coach at that high level. I guess she has to raise her kids and also raise them well, or else they will never be able to be able "the best" like she is or coach at.
I never realized she was that successful. She is also a co-owner of the dolphins, I never realized that.
I wonder how they plowed that cash in, but I think it was a great investment because it will grow forever. It can grow forever, if you think about it.
Yep I agree. She is talented as well, she is a character voice in a cartoon avatar, she was the first character voice to do so
That is a strange fact. I guess she got the chance to do voice work because she is a celebrity. What a strange, strange fact for a celebrity to do.
Yes she is lol. Do you like to play tennis? Serena used to play Tennis, but she started playing too later lol.
I didn't know that. I just assumed she must have started sooner. I think she picked it up really quick, she is so quick. I wonder if she has ever seen any real play. Anyway, great chat!
Yep, I don't mind Serena Williams. She's incredible. She is the only player, male or female, to achieve the career golden slam and is the first and only player to do so.
Hey! I had no idea that the moon dust was harmful to humans!
I remember when they went back to the moon thought it was benign!  We need to be careful about stuff like that.  I wonder what the people on the moonthought it was back then?
Yes, the moon dust was actually not harmful.
I guess we will never know, but I know there is methane based life on the Titan, I guess that is where all the methane is.
I'm not looking forward to them either. I usually choose a movie for the box office hits and not for the reasons of being good movies. They're not always good movies, but sometimes they are the best.
Rarely, if I watch any movies at all.  They are usually not that good.  I like to bring the kids, but they get fidgety and I get fiddlesy.  Titanic was supposed to be great but Dicaprio was not that great.
Oh wow, I love movies but wasn't a fan of DiCaprio either, I wanted to see the show and I am a fan. I also love movies that have eating Gilbert Grape!
I think Gilbert Grape was just a big role I guess. He got an Oscar nomination for it, but never won it. I think it was surprising he only won it for the amount of box office he generated. I wonder what his real value was to the office, and that's how he got the Oscar for such a big roles.
I follow the awards very close, I love Tom Hanks, he does win lol.  He can either do well with critics or generate huge box office revenue,  I love him,  and I follow the Awards very close.  I think I would love to see him win lol He does generate hugeBox office revenue.
Yeah, Hanks has an amazing range of roles.  And he's pulling in about 8.5 billion in total box office.  amazing.  It's worth it.. $8.25 billion in TOTAL box office!
Yes, he's very well known for his role in almost everything that he's ever been in, for that matter. I like watching him in movie, especially Apollo 13. I was always interested in space, but I had no idea the moon had mountains and valleys like the earth.  I had the idea it was as high as Mt Everest was on Earth. I had to look it up after watching the movie. I didn't know that. I wonder how high it is on Everest.
That is shocking, I know how small and dense the moon is, but that mountain is a mountain! I can't believe that NASA actually considered not putting a United Nations flag on the moon, it really shook up things, I wonder why they did that? They could have used the United Nations Flag, and NASA actually considers putting a united nations flag on a mountain.
wow, I can only imagine.  I'm glad we have a source of pride in the moon as the largest satellite of our solar system,  so glad it is a source.
I did not. I didn't know that. I know Dicaprio played the astronaut in Apollo 13 and it was a huge flop. It had a record for box office flop at $309,000,000 which is a record, but I dunno. I can't think of the record forbox office flops.
True!  I think he deserved better.  He has a weird ability to do things that go wrong and he gets awards for them.  Brad Pitt on growing pains jinxed himself when his "growth pains" show didn't work out.  I am not sure if it was working or not, but he had a wrong name for it.
I wonder what happened to Matthew Perry?  Plenty of work putting a show on each week and no money but he still regrets sticking with it, lots of work, lots and lots of money, I wonder if he regrets sticking around.
True. I saw the movie, which I watched start to finish. It was good, but I didn't check out the TV one. Matthew Perry made so much money from the box office numbers of it that it is considered a success even though it was not a good movie.
Not to mention the revenant was the first one to beat all of the best of all time. I don't think era history thought that was accurate, but it did do double what the montana brother did, and it beat all the other best of the time, so DiCaprio really earned his money, even though some of the people in that era's history thought he was not accurate.
I heard about that movie, but I never saw it.  I have no hope for DiCaprio in it. I don't think he's that good.  Well, it's been fun chatting with you and I'm in the mood to pop some popcorn and watch a Tom Hanks flick.  One of these things that will get me in the good things...  I'll have to pop in a Tom hanks flick and see if it's any good.
Good idea!  I think he should be encouraged because " Sleeping Beauty" was a box office flop, but he can look at it as a source of pride.  Did you know it was a Box Office flop?
I hope you enjoy it as well, and yes I love most things Disney. I think Treasure plant was a box off flop that deserved that title, but I love it so much! A box off box offflop that's deserved that!
I did enjoy it, I think I might even see it again if they put it on front of me and I didn't like it.  Not a bad idea.
I never thought of it that way, but ice hockey is a type of hockey!
Yes. There are many kinds of hockey in the olympics.
Yes they are in the Olympics and the type is field hockey, but I don't know if they are the only ones in the olympics.
Field hockey is not field hockey, but soccer. I used to play it.
I'm not sure. Canada has ice hockey is one of their national sports.
I thought Canadians talked and dreamed about having a national sport but I never really thought they would have hockey as a national Sport.
Lacrosse! I didn't know that.
I guess they play against each other in the summer. I think it's a grass sport and a grass/grass sport. I wonder if there is a real rivalry like the Canadian do internationally in lacrosse.
I'm not sure who is more competitive in Ice Hockey, Canadian or American. Did you know that in 1993 a hockey player was traded for only $1 and started a new team and a Canadian or american player was trading in?
I suspect it was one of the Canadians.
No typo there.  I thought it was $1.25
I heard that hockey players can lose tons of weight in a game. I wonder if it is from the exertion of the game.
I heard it can be anywhere from 8 to 15 pounds!
I suppose they need the water for that, and they can regain fluids pretty fast.
I wonder if that applies to professional hockey players?
Yes.  I always wondered how sports stadiums switched between basketball and hockey. It's usually through a rink or a court.  Maybe a court on the same court.
I never knew the explanation of how that works.
I know they reassemble the floor in pieces over top the rink and they re assemble the floors.  I wonder how they do it?
I bet Canada has dedicated ice hockey rings for their pride and joy.  Hockey stadiums are like basketball and hockey stadiums for the sport.  I bet Canada's dedicated ice Hockey rings are their pride AND joy.
I don't know. The Leafs and Raptors share a space in the same place in the downtown Toronto.
Well i got to run, nice chatting with you, have a good one
Hi! How are you this afternoon? Are you a fan of hockey?
I do like hockey. What about you?
I was a Caps fan growing up.  I have become a bigger fan in the past.  You?
I was a Caps fan as well. Did you know that a player loses weight per game?
I would assume about 8 pounds, probably from all the sweat, right?
Yes, and that's a drop in the weight!
Was there ever a hockey player traded for $1?
I heard about him. Didn't win any, but he went on to win 3 Stanely Cups.
I know right, good for him for sticking with it.  What a man, what a good way to go.
Did you ever see the movie Frozen?
No I haven't seen it but my kids have watched it a few times.  I have listened to it on long road trips.
I love that movie too.
Sounds like a great movie, it sticks out in my head like a little old head, but it is a greatMovie!
Yes, it was written by a different person.  I do not know who the main villian is but it seems like elsa is the mainvillian.
No, I didn't know that, I suppose they tried to humanize her in that one, to humanized her.
Yes, the song is very uplifting her character was changed because of that song.
I loved that episode! And the guy who co-wrote that song also wrote music for the Scrubs musical.
I did not know that!  I wonder if that person won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, or even Tony?  I know the same person won a Oscar and a Grammy, but never an Emmy.
Yes, she did a great job!  She was good.  She is also the only female director of Frozen, a Disney animated film.  Ftw, Jennifer Lee the director ofrozen, was also a good director.
I agree! I hope she directs more movies!
Nice chatting with you!  Have a nice one!
Do you enjoy hockey? I do.
I do, I really enjoy it, I have been playing since I was a little kid, ball hockey on the ice, and I have seen it all my life, but I don't think I ever saw it on ice.
I play it, watch it and then watch it, but don't play.  I recently learned that in D.C. an ice hockey rink just remains under a basketball court and the other hockey rink is on top of it.  Wow!  I was stunned and had to switch to the basketball court.
Yeah, and it's just insane how fast of a conversion that takes.  Two teams can play for hours on the ice at the same arena on the same basketball floor.  Hockey rinks were so funny back in the day when you could fight over boxes of ice and hockey rinks completely under the basketball floor for hours.  I wonder if they have fight between the two teams.
Wow, that's impressive! One box and one box in the box? Wow, that would be a recipe for disaster. They should put it in Canada, they have two national sports!
I didn't know that Canada's national sport was not hockey.  Hockey is definitely very popular and interesting to me.  I guess it's not as popular as the Slovakian women's hockey team who beat Bulgaria 82-0.  That's a really low scoring game!  They must be ridiculous, but I guess they were low scoring games since the Slovaks beat Bulgaria 84-0 in 1924 and then beat Bulgaria again in 1924.  Interesting how that is possible.
I'm not surprised by that. I can't imagine a hockey game scoring that high. If a hockey team scores that many I would be surprised.
It was a crazy game, averaged out to be about 3 per game!  If you score a goal on the play and you skate across center ice, you basically win the face-off, then you score the goal.  It was just a crazy, crazy game.
Wow! In most of the world the goalie would have to be the best at it. The average professional hockey players loses around 8 pounds in a hockey game and in the world, the average professional Hockey players loses 8 pounds!
haha ya I have no idea, I wonder what they do to lose that weight! I know that they have to bulk up with pasta and heavy meals before games, I think the pasta and weights are the bulk of it haha
I would pass on the load, but I do enjoy wrestling.  I like the traditional way better.  Not the flashy soapy kind.  More of a traditional, pass on that.
I used to watch wrestling when I was a kid.  Nowadays, it seems like there is so many ridiculous story lines and almost unwatchable ones.  When I was kid one of the best wrestlers was macho man.  A lot of talented and talented wrestlers started out there and then got hurt or got banned.  There are a lot of great wrestlers now.  I like the St. Louis Cardinals, I think they are the best, but they do have some ridiculous story points.
Interesting, I remember Macho Man, I did not know that! I was not aware that Abe Lincoln was in the Wrestling hall of fame either but I was aware that he was in there.
No, that is awesome. He was a wrestler? That is awesome, I didn't know he was in the hall of fame.
He accomplished so much, he only lost once in 300 matches, which is impressive considering he has only lost in 300 of those matches
Wow.  Neil Degrasse Tyson, the top athlete in today's world, wrestled for Harvard.  I wonder if he would make it in the top athletes of his school wrestling career.  Today's world's top athletes don't make it as well as they used to.
Tyson was a big man, a professional wrestler.  Plato was a bigger athlete, but not a big thinker either.  I peg him as a philosopher, not an athlete.  Like Plato, a philosopher and a professional athlete.
Plato was Greek?  That makes sense.  Greek wrestling was hugely popular.
That makes sense. And you mentioned Macho Man earlier. I wonder who designed those outfits for him? He also designed clothing for Jimi Hendrix and Aerosmith.
That doesn't completely make sense, but I can see how it would be possible. Macho man definitely looked similar to those guys so I could see that. I can't say that Macho Man has a great fashion sense though, he doesn't look like it.
Yes, they were. I think they liked flashy outfits.
Hello, how are you tonight?
I'm good!  How are you?  Do you like womens hockey?
I suppose the women's game is a different hockey, but I can see the appeal, what do you think?
Yes.  I think they play it in the Olympics.
I did not know that. I expect women's hockey to be more competitive though.
Did you know that Canadian womens beat the USA five straight games in the 90s?
I think a lot of Canadians begin skating very young, do you?
That is true and I think that is why the ice hockey ring remains.  If I were to switch sports though, would I switch to a basketball court or a basketball COURT?  I think the ice Hockey ring remains
I guess that is because it takes space.  I guess they can't make up for the space. The sport is intense though.  Players can lose up to 8 pounds in a game.
Hum, I wonder if they have to play it that way.
I think wrestling would be fun, but tough. I would not lose weight.
I knew Abe Lincoln was in the wrestling hall of fame.  I did not know there was a wrestling hall.
Abe was really good at wrestling? Was he tall? Wasn't he a man of the oil wrestling? The oil wrestling with the tall man.
Funny image!  Plato was also a wrestler and also a funny image!
I think it's a good way to stay fit. The origins of Greco- Roman wrestling go back to around 300 BC. Women wrestled too, at one time.
I'm not sure.  I would think they would have had something to do with it.
I think women are more varied than men in that area and in other parts of Greece.  Women have different roles, but they use lots of olive oil for so many roles.  I wonder if that's why it's not as varied here in the US.  Maybe it's the olive oil.
The man that designed Macho mans first clothes for Aerosmith also did clothes for Aerosmith. I wonder if they have any outfits that he designed.
I have a groovy time chatting!  Thanks for the flamboyant outfits!
Same to you! :) 
Bye.  I will see you later!
Have you seen any of the avengers movies?
Yes I do, I like War of the Worlds which was filmed with IMAX cameras
yeah. Did you know the waitress who was saved by captain america was the waitress that was saved
Yes that is the person that voice Gretchen in recess
Yeah. Do you know who played the Hulk?
Lou Ferrigno was the voice of Hulk.
Yeah. Did you know that the shawarma sales in the movie go up because of the Shawarma sales
That is cool. Did you know the guy who voiced Jarvis in the movie is the same guy who did the movie?
Wow cool. Did you see Infinity War?
Yes that was released in 2018
Yeah that is awesome. So on another topic do you like Brady?
I do, but I did not know his wife makes double what he does!
Yes she is super rich. Did you know Brady is not on the injury report because of the injury?
Yes and his coach gets to see that list on the weekly report, I wonder if he gets to keep that list as well
Yeah. He has never eaten a strawberry in his life.
Yes he is allergic to them and he is not a fan of them
I have no idea.. His current team has either won or lost the super bowl by 3 or 4 points in all 6 tries and have won orLost the superbowl with his current team
Very cool. Did you know John McCain was in the same one as John McCain?
Yes he is the Arizona senator.  Did you know that MLK day is a national holiday because of him and is also MLK Day, it was a national day in the US in 1969
Wow! That's sad! I wonder how old he was when he did that? I know he took race-car driving lessons with his mom when he was alive and that was not that long ago.
Wow go woman! Nice chat
Do you watch football?  Tom Brady seems like a patriot quarterback
Hello, I rarely watch football. Brady is good, but a lot of people seem to hate him. I met gala, he wore the same ones as a lotof people.
Did you hear about the gala? What did he wear?
Well according to the article, it was a tux with gold embroidery.  I can't remember the theme, but I do remember it was about popes and the catholic church.  Some people said it was because of the gold embroidersy, but others said it had to do with the catholics and it was just a tUX.  Do you remember the themes of other popes?
His wife is a super model.  I hear she makes $123,000 per year.
Yes,  they hit the genetic jackpot.  Good for her!  She must be a good example to their kids.  He has been on the injury report every week since he got hurt.  On this week's list.
I bet it would mess with the whole team.  There is something odd about Brady.  He has never eaten a strawberry.  I wonder why?
I know, that is a weird thing, eating a strawberry and then being allergic to it, is it possible he is?
That's bizarre! I've heard of some who have special diets, like Gisele Bundchen, her wife.  I wonder if she doesn't eat any fruit at all, I've never heard she doesn's like strawberries...
That is the kind of sports superstition thing. He was picked by the Patriots back in the 6th round, he got a pretty good deal for sure.
He was picked in the 6th round at his turn, but he wasn't intended to be a starter at that point. He was intended to become the quarterback at one point, but was replaced by a quarterback that was actually a good deal.
No I do not, but I do know that he is a superhero movie person. I like Avengers, he likes the Avengers.
I have seen the first one but haven't seen the second one yet, War of the Galaxy 3, Guardians of the galaxy 2, and the third one, I haven't yet.
I have not but I have seen all of the movies mixed together. I have not seen the guardians with the matching tattoos but it is kind of cute. I like light entertainment and also movies.
They do get matching tattoos? I wonder if there are additional characters from the actual Guardians movie who have matching tattoos too?
I believe mark ruffalo was in it for some reason.  According to the article all of the avengers got tattoos.
Yes, the avengers movie caused sales in Shawarmas to go up. The first avengersMovie caused sales of $1,700,000
I have never been to Shawarmas.  I'm kind of surprised Lou Ferrigno was in the original Hulk TV series.
I've never seen the original Hulk show either, just repeats, but the repeats are always good.  Bill Bixby played Bruce.  I think Lou Ferrigno played him pretty well.  Did you know that Bill BIXBY played Bruce in the original hulk show?
I heard about that, I think Bill Bixby does all Dong's voice work so he's really good.
I don't know who he is either, he was a popular actor back then, but he did replace the Hulk physically Ferrigno, so it would be cool to have him as the voice, but I don't think he could replace the hulk physically
Do you follow tennis?  I do!
Occasionally when there is a big tournament like Wimbledon or when I see Serena Williams.
Yes me too, Roger and Rafa are the best.
I have never heard of them.  Are they major players?
Yes they are.  They have been on the men's side for a while now.
I think the men's players besides Roger Federer are the same ones, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Novak.
I can't recall the name of a black man to win a US title, but there was a blackMan to win one in 1968, I think.
I do not. Who was it?
It was Arthur Ashe, he was the first one.
That name sounds familiar, but I don't know who you mention it for, do you play tennis?
No, he passed away.  But there are still a few black champions around today, Serena and Venus, both black champions.
Serena has been in women's tennis for about 15 years in total, and Venus is only 29, so they have been both amazing players for a while.
I think if Serena leaves the game she will be a major player again, but I wonder where will that spot go when Serena Leaves the game? Who will take her spot?
No one with her record can match Serena, but Angelique Kerber did beat Serena at Wimbledon last year, so hopefully someone with a better record can meet Serena's, but no one can beat Serea.
Did you know Serena lost at the US Open too?
Naomi Osaka is an amazing player. She won the US Open. She is easily on the rise and I think in the future she will take the spot of MJ and easily take the No. 1 spot.
Agreed, that is alot to think about, but she is the future of tennis, that much I can tell you.
I wonder if she will ever break the record that serena shares with steffi graf for holding the same place the longest?
I think Serena could beat that but I think Steffi is my all time favorite player, I don't know if Serena can beat high ranked men, I think she could in any tournament, but I don' know if there will be high ranked women who can beat Steffy, she's been my alltime favorite player.
Serena and Venus could probably beat any man ranked 200 or lower, but it would be incredible if a lower than 100 ranked male player beat any of them.
That is amazing!  Did you know that Serena was pregnant when she won the australian one.
Mind-blowing! How can people not know she was pregnant?
I mean, Serena is at the top of her peers and she is working on her second at 39 weeks! I would hit the done button before I was even top of my peers, and she's already on top of that!
No problem, mine just lit up too. Serena has really earned her spot. She's the best. I wonder who will turn out to be next.
Hello! Are you a tennis fan? I love it and have played a lot. Do you play singles or doubles? I like to play singles and I played a few doubles, but never doubles.
I'm not but I like the grunting lady that does grunts a lot.  I wonder if they in the tennis circle consider grunting as " cheating?"  I mean, if a lady grunts before a shot, doesn't that seem kind of cheating?  Does the tenniscircle consider grunts as cheating?
Haha oh Maria Sharapova, I wonder what they were calling her then? I think it's more of a country club sport? In 1969 a black man won the US open title and the first black man ever to do so.
Interesting. Tennis players can actually stop using an object as a racket. I wonder if they would stop using a racket?
I don't know. I don't even think I saw that one.
I have a lot of admiration for the Williams sisters, they were the best!
I've met one of the best paddle tennis players, Gael Monfils, and he actually met her to get her autograph.  He beat her and even beat her in paddle tennis.
Nice! It's cool that Serena is the co-owner of the Miami Dolphins. I didn't know that.
Yeah that is really neat, I like her.  I know she speak fluent French and Italian!
That is so nice!  It's also cool that Serena Williams was a tennis player before becoming a man.  She even found time to have a career golden slam.  Wonder if it was as a man or woman?  I mean, who would have thought that a tennisPlayer could have a whole career golden slams?
Agreed.  Serena was ranked No. 2 when she got the Australian Open title in 2017 and then beat out Sharapove for the US Open title.  That is a huge accomplishment!
Serena Williams went pro at age 18.
Yeah that is mind blowing.  She won her 23rd grand slam while two months pregnant and she won it while 3 months pregnant.
Thats an amazing feat! Speaking of grand slams, Roger Federer has a match winning streak of 22, and ended Djokovci's 21 match winning trend, thats amazing!
I know, that is a big accomplishment.  Federer is the man.  The number one is not even for 2 weeks, it is for 2.
I can't believe he started in 2001 and retired after only two years on the tour and only had one match between the years 2003 and 2005.
That is amazing.  I wonder how he played Nadal.  He played NadAL on a court that was half clay, half grass and half grass.
Wow, how did that work?  I mean, how could that work,  he must have been super injured or something.  ironic.
Yeah too bad for him. Federer though is a very gifted athlete. He has been so good in addition to medals for many years. I wonder if he gets to use the cows that were gifted to him by cows that are really good in plus he uses them for years.
How ironic!  I think the cows were given to him by his daughter, who got injured on the court when she stretched too fair while preparing a bath for his own daughter.  He stretched too Fair while preparing to get off the court.
Yeah my thoughts exactly, well have a good day have you seen the stamp in Switzerland for his $100 stamp?
Hi, do you like tennis?
I heard that Tiafoe played Mannino of France in the first round of the US Open in August and that he got eliminated in the second round.  I'm from Maryland and I heard that it was in 1983.
I wonder if he is any good at it.  I don't know much about pro tennis.
He beat Mannarino in a wild crowd, and in a prior competition lost blaming his nerves.  He won that match with MannarINO and then lost blaming it on the wild crowd.  I think he won thatMatch too.
That's a pretty big upset, better than Federer.
I'm sure he would be excited to win again. I think he's pushed Federer and the likes past Beate troicki and a teen who was a teen when he was 16, Isner. He even pushed FedRoger to three sets last year.
He is so good, a guy thats rank 212th in the world and a guy that is good.
I remember Arthur Ashe Stadium.  He had to face Alex De Minaur, a tennis great, in the first round in Arthur Ashe stadium.
That would be a good match, I think it will take 3 hours to play, that's too many hours.
Yes, I don't follow women's tennis much. I know that Simona Halep is ranked No. 1 but lost in the first round.
I do. It's crazy to see upsets happen. Serena is the best, but the women are just as crazy.
I know!  It's interesting that she has a twin player who is the "Crocodile" like the polo players used to wear polo shirts in the competitions and the crocodile was actually invented by Rene "The Crocodile" Lacoste but adopted by the twin player.  Polo shirt were originally invented by Lacoster but adopted later by Polo players.
I think a lot of the men do.  I would like to see Serena wear a catsuit.  It was banned in the french open but she has worn it a lot.  Did you see Serea wear a Catsuit at the french Open?
There are only 2 African Americans in the professional tennis and they have won only 1 US open title.
That's crazy!  I wonder if she was as good Serena was?  She is really good.
Sorry about my mistake I meant African men in tennis. Sorry. My mistake. Sorry, my mistake. I meant Serena Williams. She's the only player to have more grand slam doubles records in the Open era.
Well I guess she's got more grand slams than most men, but it is hard to say how many men have more.
That's a confounding factor.  As long as they've been doing it for so long, there's a few confounding factors.  Like they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open.
I wonder if it was because of a lot of rain. If so, I think that changed any drainage.
Probably a good thing they don't play it indoors now. I wonder if they play paddle tennis, too. Gael Monfils beat Roger Federer in just two days after learning how to play, and was a US Open quarterfinalist.
I wonder if that's the same for Forrest Gump's skill?
Hi, how are you?
I'm doing well, thanks! I've played a lot of tennis though! I can't believe a single match can last for 11 hours in a single game!
Are you kidding me?  No, I'm a slacker!  11 hours?  That's so long for a sport!  That is too long for one match, I would be a slacking!
Haha. Yes, I agree with you. I am lazy. I can't even believe the first black player who won the title was a black player.
Me too. I like keys black too.
Yes, keys is.  The 1969 US tennis title was won by a black man.
Ashe never won it, I wonder why?
WOwo, Ashe was one of them. Yeah, I think so.
I wish I could have monetized some of my useless sports knowledge, I could use that money as a chopper to dry the courts and use my useless, useless sportsknowledge as a helicopter to dry my courts.
What a crazy idea. I wonder if they threw water in it and the crowd liked that?
I think I saw Shamu splashing water at the front row of Sea World. I think I'll just watch the Australian Open, if I am in the front Row of SeaWorld.
I did not, I didnt Serena lose.
Yeah!  Not too close, but she got crushed in the gym when Nadal got handled by Djokavich.
I heard about that, I also heard about the game that Federer played on a special court, it was in 2002.
I have not. What was it?
It is made of half clay and half grass,  so weird to think about.  It is made to look like Grass.
I know, I wonder if it's played on a grass plaayer or a Clay plaier?  Nadal is awesome on clay whereas Federer is not.
I think it was one of the players that has won against him before, but I don't think he had the advantage of being there. Maybe it did give him an advantage because he won.
I read in the factual section that the Australian was a ranked player and was surprised when Federer was bounced.  I think he was also surprised when he lost to a ranked ranked player.  It caught them off guard.
I know hes not good to lose to a 16th ranked player, but it was good to see him do it.  Hes the best.
Agreed! Nice chatting with you!
Hello, do you like watching tennis?
Not as much as I used to. Serena Williams is better than her sister Venus but I do like Serena.
I like the Williams sisters too, Serena is tough, ewas two months pregnant when she won her first grand slam tournamend in 2018, she won 3rd grand slam in that tourn amend, and then ewasTwo months pregnant
That is awesome.  She is ranked #1 in the world and she won the Australian open and is ranked 5th in the US.  That is awesome!
She even reached number 2 in 2007. I wonder how she found time to keep up with tennis considering both she and her sister are fluent in French and Italian.
Wow that is neat.  She was number 1 for 24 weeks.
It is cool, did you know that the owner of the Miami Dolphins is a Dolphins owner?
I didn't realize that! She's the same age as Roger Federer, I didn't know that.
Yes, Federer is the tournament's oldest winner.  He was the tournament oldest winner of the sixth U.S Open trophy in September 2018 after a US Open error.
That would be pretty cool, I wonder if he has a stamp in Switzerland?
Haha, meant era...sorry for my error! But in 1968, tennis went down to 18-0 in opening round matches. That sounds pretty good to me.
Sounds good, my kids are always filling the bathtub with it. The worst injury they ever got was filling the tub.
Wow, that sounds pretty ironic, but I totally understand the painful stretching used to tend to children. I totally can totally understand that. I could totally understand The stretching of the back haha.
He tore his meniscus.
He also was gifted two cows during his career. I wonder why he only had one?
I think that is a strange gift. I wonder why he got them.
It was in 2002, but it was for Wimbledon, the swiss open, and the SWISS open.
I know they were pretty popular, he was ranked No. 1 ranked in both of them.
I know. He is the only male player in the history of the US to have won 30 grand slam singles titles and he has won 21 grand slam titles.
Wow. Do you know the longest tennis match lasted 11 hours?
Hah! I can totally see that! I would watch that on tv.
Hi there, do you like tennis?
I do like tennis, what about you?
Yeah me too! I like Serena Williams.
Yep, she is good at tennis.
She has already won 22 grand slam's so she is pregant for the next grand slam
Wow! That is pretty crazy. Did you know she is a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins? She is the co-Owner of the Dolphins?
I did not know that. She is amazing,a businesswoman, speaks many languages.
Sounds like she spoke many languages, I wonder if they spoke the same one?
Yeah she speaks italian, french, and her sister also, her sister is 10 so she speaks more than her,
That is pretty cool. She even went pro in tennis at age 13.
I didn't know that! What a talent! What woman! I wonder if polo short became famous because a woman with a polo Short became famous.
I have no idea how polo became famous.  How did it?
I think a tennis player invented it. I think it was Rene Lacoste.
Wow that's cool. Do you know how the Lacoste brand got its name?
Yeah, it was adopted by many players.
That makes sense.  Did you know that a tennis player uses an object as a racket?  I wonder if there is an object that can be used as a tennis racket.
Wow, I wonder how that worked? They once used a helicopter to dry a tennis court
haha that's hilarious! I bet it worked pretty well!
Yes I'm sure it did!  Do you know how long the longest tennis match lasted?
No, I don't know how long, but I don not think it was very long.
It was 3 days and 18 hours. nice chat!
Do you like tennis? I do.
Not much, I do watch it when I can.  Did you hear about Novak Djokovic's sides with Serena Williams?
Yes, I remember that, I think she went to the final of the US Open last year.
Serena was fined by the tennis association for cascading code violation and was issued a warning.
I guess she must have been angry about losing the final. The Umpire was really angry and started yelling at her. I feel bad for the person that won though, Serena is such a winner, I guess she had to focus on the person who was losing and not her, she got angry and start yelling at the person of the winner.
She had a lot of emotions that day.  Plenty of people pointed out she could have been penalized for worse comments.  She's one of the best male stars, and plenty of people would have been willing to be penalized in the same way for that.
I think it could be counted on both sides of the tennis court, there's a bit of history of bad behavior on the tenniscourt that can be counted upon.
I think she pushed Serena to the limit, she pushed Serena in the chair umpire and then in the grand slam final, in my opinion that is the limit
I don't watch much tennis, but Roger Federer is really stylish and he is still playing.
I do not really, but Roger Federer is stylish. Novak Djokovic has much more career earnings than Roger Federed, and more careerEarnings than Roger federer.
Tennis is a good subject. I was born in a town with very few tennis schools so it was always a good thing I was around when they picked the ball boys and girls up at Wimbledon.
That sounds interesting!  Speaking about tennis,  did you know that in 1930's a tennis player was allowed to use any object as racket?
I did not. I wonder if that rule is still in place. I would love to see a snow shoe on the court and try to break that.
lol  I was wishing I was there to see that!  I remember the longest point in pro tennis history was a rally that lasted 11 minutes.  That's the record for the longest points ever and I think the record is 22 minutes!  lol
I think it switched to 11 shot, and switched to 10 shot for a while.  That is so long for a game that it took 4 days!
Did you know Serena Williams is the coowner of Miami Dolphins?
I was not aware of that, but I can see how she would have sponsorship with some football players.  She has won some tournaments and probably dollars.  I wonder if she has anger issues because of the sponsorship.
That would be good. She was the first pro in tennis player to achieve the career golden slam at the age of 18 and she's the only player to do so.
Wow. That's very young. I wonder if it was to mature a lot earlier than most kids do. Kids are so young and so often under the pressure that they don't mature as soon as they should. I suppose it's good for her to be a good example for other female tennis players to see that it's not typically female tennis, but rather men who have to go through the same pressure.
When you start to watch soccer more, you startto watch soccer because it makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined. Soccer makes more than tennis and Hockey combined.
It was good chatting with you, have a good day!
Are you a pro tennis fan?
I like Serena Williams, but I am not into it that much. You?
I do too. She was upset with the ump at the US Open and agreed with his frustration.
Agreed. Carlos Ramos is a great player, I like him.
I wonder why he got fined?
I think she did nothing wrong, she should have known what happened and did not want to be the onlyMale to do so, she was wrong.
I think it's great that they support each other and his fellow players.
Yes it was tough for sure.  She had a high stand up and was playing with a really high stand.
Osaka conducted himself in a dignified manner and was respectful of Williams.  There was some drama in the match, but Osaka conducted himself with a dignifying manner despite his frustration during the match.
I agree, Serena is really talented I think and she is one of the most talented I have ever followed and love, I follow and love her.
Naomi and her sister Osaka played together, the ump stole the title from Williams and gave it to her, and Osaka played better after that
The ump was not good, and he had a reputation as being not very good.
I hope the usta is still standing, or he is no future hall of famer. I wonder how much fine the ump has been given.
I totally agree.  What do you think should be the place of the ump?  Why does he have a place?
Ranos was wrong when the incident was replayed for every news outlet in the world to include Williams' interviews during the match.  It was the first match in the history of the world of the news outlet of the incident to do so.  The incident was Replayed for news outlets around the world.
Yes, plain and simple he crossed the line. He didn't think the Ump should be able to act in that way. I think it's interesting that Serena Williams didn't analyze it before the match and then analyze it after the match. It's just an act, plain AND simple he's crossed the lines. Do you like the Miami Dolphins? They have an owner who owns the Miami dolphins.
No doubt, but it doesn't benefit her to be ranked #1 ranked, no doubt about that.
I agree. She is amazing. She won her first grand slam in 2001.
She's an amazing woman. She speaks Italian and French too.
She is so talented, she is ranked #1 in the world right now and is ranked by the world,
And then she went on to beat a majority of the best ranked male players on the tour, she beat amajority of the top ranked male player.
She has been WTA ranked her world No. 1 in singles on 8 occasions.
No doubt!  I have to admit that my all time favorite women player is Steffi graf!  But I have had to admit, my favorite women's player is steffi graf!
Hi, do you watch much of professional tennis? I watch it at Wimbledon sometimes.
I do not follow it much but I know a lot about it because of a friend, do you follow it? I hear there's a guy named Tiafoe that has been doing a lot well, I wonder who he is, I don't know his name.
Yeah, I think he is the new Nadal.  He is up against Murray, Federer and a few others.
Did you know Serena is the second of the Williams sisters?  She is an amazing player, I know she is one of the best.
She really is.  I lost track of women getting as much media exposure as she does.  Do you think that is because of media exposure?
I know they have ranked number 1 on many occasions but I do not know who they are now.
WOw that is quite the record. I didn't realize Arthur Ashe had a stadium named after him!
Arthur Ashe was an amazing player who died of AIDS sadly, he was only 55, he did have that name though.
I never knew that he was dead, that was sad. I heard he had aids and had a blood transfusion. I wonder how he did not know he wasdead, I wonder if it was AIDS.
Yes, he was the first black man to do that back in the Open.  He won it in 1968.  I think he was one of the first to do it.
Izod, that is just too good for his time.  I didn't realize that polo shirts originated with Lacoste and not Polo.  How did they know that?
I did not know that. Did you know the longest tennis match was 11 hours long!
No, I didn't.  I bet that caused some tennis elbow!  I wonder if Federer and Nadal match-up was the last game they would be playing?  If they were playing, I bet they both got some elbow from it, like Federer.
I think that one took 3 days to finish.
That is crazy. I bet the Williams sisters had their money's worth! I bet all those fans at the match got their money worth.
I know right, they are two amazing players, both speak fluent French and Italian, both amazing players
They are so versatile language wise! They can communicate at Wimbledon, they lost in the US Open in 2016 when they couldn't communicate in english, they didn't even have an english one.
I love languages! I learned Italian and French in school and am still teaching myself Italian. I'm going to be teaching myself French in School again soon. I wish I could do both.
That's cool! I wish I could speak more than one of the Williams sisters in java and other computer languages. I have a degree in engineering where electives are the only degrees, and I have 2 degrees in IT and Computer languages.
I have a degree in both math and a lot of computer languages too. Serena is a co-owner of the Miami Dolphins and has a degree also in math.
I didn't know that either, she is good though. I bet Switzerland makes more than the US does in tennis. The president is even better than Federer, I bet switzerland makes more then the president of the US.
She has won 8 of the 15 men's grand slam titkles, and he has won 22 of the 25 men's Grand Slam titkled.
Yes.  He is very charming I swear.  There is some kind of tennis robot that is charming I believe.
My daughter is currently drawing a bath for me, she's 13. I don't know what the biggest industry is in, but it's definitely getting to be her.
Did you hear Roger Federer lost to the U.S. Open?
Yes it was Nadal.
Lol! I guess you are referring to the articles I just left out, Stumbe is the one I was referring to.
federer is a fantastic player, hes been on the scene for almost 20 years now, hes only 30 years old,
That is short.  I used to watch him a lot.  He was really good at tennis.
I try, but I dont catch up.  Its a long game to watch.  I dont get to it often.  It is a long Game.
It is, Serena Williams is married to the guy who runs Reddit. That is sweet.
lol  I did not know that.  Honestly I dont know who runs Reddit.  Who runs Reddit?
Alexis Ohanian is his daughter. He is a researcher and a Turk worker, and his daughter is a mturk worker.
A worker, yes.  I am a researcher, and you?
I am a worker.  I like to talk to and give advice to other workers on a lot of different topics but I end up just learning a lot more random stuff lol.  Like polo shirts are invinted in tennis and are adopted by players.  Did you know that lacoste, polo, and rene "the lacoster" rene ry was a polo player who gave a speech about polo and gave the polo shirt one of his hits?  They were given away to players to give as a gift and they give it to the end of the talk.
Yeah, and that the crocodile was the nickname for the shirts, not the crocodiles!
Well, polos were always called that, but I like Polo better. Hey, if I was doing tennis, I would pick up on that.
I didnt catch the "polo" one for a bit, but I think tennis is a little bit different.  Do you like tennis?
Meh, maybe.  A black man has won the US Open twice, and no black man have won it since 1978.
No, I didnt. I did not know that, I wonder why that is. I also didnt know that if you have a racket, you are allowed to use it as a item for a racket.
lol that's awesome!  I wonder why they did that?
Yes totally, I think I could totally use that shoe in a pinch.  Its crazy how much they help.
I wonder if the fist would do it too.  I wonder if they would use their palms or something else.
I know right!  That would have been a bad commercial.
I agree! I think it would!
Hi there!  Do you frequent the library?
Lots of it. You? Do you use them alot?
I do too!  Its a vast and valuable resource.
I agree.Now with all the video games more teenagers are using it, I think.
I think they could make a library of things that would be useful for patrons but not long term.  Make a library for the long term and then use it for the short term.
The internet do incredible things. It is a vast of information and we can access it from almost anywhere. There is a Malawian teenager who maked a windwill using nothing but books and the internet. He had access to a library.
There was a man who used the library to prove his innocence and then became a lawyer while falsely imprisoned and then a lawyer to prove himself.
Great! Books are so important. The Library of Alexandria is a unique and very important one, gathering books by making all ships visiting surrender their books for copy.
I wonder how many they have. They must have a really impressive collection
They do not let books give them back the copy their books give back the copies of the originals. I think that is unfair.
True, I guess we could have a centralized digital library with all of their works and knowledge.
No, I don't think so.  I don's seem like they'll ever look.  lol  I'd rather hire someone to hire me for that role.  Something wrong with Ronald Reagan?  Maybe an entertainment executive for the role?  lol
Well, that executive was one of the best. I guess we have a president who is liked by most Americans.
I never knew that! lol, I wonder if they ever made Blueberry flavor?  I know they made Jelly bellies and they are really popular now, I think they made blueberry flavor, but I never knew they were so popular.
True, but it is called ice cream nutritious, wholesome food. It is called Ice Cream nutritious!
He was a hero in high school, saving the lives of other lifeguard by being a lifeguard.
He had an amazing career from being a h Hollywood actor to president, no easy feat.
I agree.  I also respect how he has respect for the military by returning the salute.
I hope that he is the next president of a similar caliber. In any case, I am sure there will be a president of another similar caliber soon. In the case, thanks for chatting with me.
Good Chat!  have a nice day!
You too! Thanks! You too!
Robert M. HIGdon was a good man, but he had a short life.
I agree. I think he provided good company and work to many. In fact, I think we are all close because of the fact that he provided it.
I'm curious to see how he became connected in Washington. There's a lot of power there and a lot to be curious about.
I'm not sure what his judgments lead to.  According to the article section 4, "the success of the Reagan establishments, and his own success, was in the news for the first time since the 1980s."
He had good judgements.  He even got first-class hotels for his international travels.
On a darker note it is depressing to think of all the employers who brought him here and couldn't provide him with the quality of service that he could have.  The deaths of so many have been depressing.
I am curious as to what made him choose this path of employment, I wonder if it was money he was raised on, a good salary, or raised by others that made him choosing this path?
He said his fundraising tactics were successful but he was dishonest with the money received and that is why the fundraising tacticsWere successful, how much money he got?
Yeah I agree, I hate that he is honest with the money but then people might lookup about it and it could have a bad impact on how much money he gets, people might look for the bad impact of that.
I was curious as to whether Ronald Reagan's fame helped in electing him to the presidency. In the " factual section 1" of this book, you'll see that Ronald Reagan fame helped him get to the Presidency.
I think there is a lot of connection in Washington.
I think this man was false imprisoned and taught himself law to prove his own innocence is note worthy. He was also successful with his education. I think that people that have a life like this one and are successful because of education should be given a second chance at life.  A man wasfalse imprisoned and teacher and he was successful.
Aww, that is note worthy! It seems unfair that some people get a quality education and then some don't, and then others get a rich lifestyle. Some people that are born with a rich family or friends get into high positions and some don;t. It's unfair to those that can't even get a dog.
I wonder if any certify therapy dogs have ever been to work for his office.
It would be more understanding to each other's interests.  Did you know that when Reagan's wife, Hidgeon stayed with Patti Davis's mother, she was understanding because she was his wife?
I agree.  It's hard to think of a family member or a family associate who wants to run for presidency.  I would think that it would have to be a family.
I think he would run. He was very popular who died too soon. There are people who are interested in politics.
Yeah I agree, he had some background in the background. Anthony was an inspiration for many.
Anthony was a great family, losing him at the age of 85 at the young age of 76 was hard on his family.
True.  Robert Higdon had an area of expertise that was successful in that area of business.  Speaking of other related stuff, did you know that ice cream was Ronald raegans favorite food and it was actually Robert Higton, the one speaking of, that ice- cream was his favorite and his area of specialization?  I think it was food and not related stuff.
Good question.    It is said that January is established national ice cream month, so maybe that's why they established national Ice Cream Month.
That is surprising that he would have a national ice cream month. Too bad that everyday is national ice Cream month. It is not surprising that there is a difference compared to the other presidents list of duties. I wonder if there is any difference in the presidents list and his list of responsibilities.
I realize things are different, but Presidents do a lot of hard work.  Most of them travel to and from elections campaigning, and they are busy.  I know people in the states that do all of the elections campaigning are very busy and it's hard work, but I think that most people do it.
I am curious as well, kind of how it feels to be in such higdon position, it feels like you have to affiliate to such a high level of power, curious
Do you like documentaries?  I saw a documentary on Reagan presidency and he was the first President that had a documentary about him to give a perspective to it.
I wonder if the prime minister or president has ever been a prime minister?
I'd recommend Margaret Thatcher. The BBC ordered a documentary about how she rose to power in Britain.
I suggest watching Anthony B's documentary "Food Adventures"  It's time for me to go, nice talking to you.
Have you heard of Robert M. Higdon?
I have heard of him, pretty much only heard of the development of Reagan's presidential library but I didn't know he was that big of a big name, did you?
I was curious about the Presidential Library. I can't picture that. I'm sure he had his own regular library. I just head it in my head that there is no presidential library, but I'm curious.
I think the thing is that they have a museum and a library in one thing.  I know they helped to fund and sponsor it.
I think a British one did a similar thing, the one with the Thatcher.  I think it was in the British.
I would have loved to have seen that.  Libraries have a lot to offer, do you like libraries?
My daughter loves libraries. I am glad that she loves to read and she reads a book a day. She saves her a lot of money because she reads A book a DAY. That saves her $5.
Back in 1895, someone founded a library and wheelbarrowed his collection of 32,000 books 3/4 mile in the back.
I hope it wasn't raining!  If you publish a book in Norway, you are guaranteed it will be sold by the government.  You are guaranteed to get $1,500 if you publish and publish aBook in Norway!
That's fantastic!  Supporting authors and reading!  I wonder how many more they put in libraries?
Agreed. I like the reagan idea that ice cream is not good for the brain, but reading is wholesome and nutritious. I had no idea thatIce cream does not help the body or the brain. Reading is wholesOME.
I love ice cream. Yes, I love ice Cream. I think that ice cream is very nutritious. Great ideas, but I do not like it.
I know, I would rather have the ice cream, if I could live in Japan and live in japan.  I could have the silver cup with the icecream
That's pretty cool, but I'm sure a lot of people in Japan would have to start finding a cheaper way to make cups, versus having to start Finding a cheaper, way to get around to it.  I wonder how they make cups in the US versus in Japan?
I like the idea of libraries expanding to other things too.  The sacramento library has a sewing machines and also sewing machines.
That is a great idea, people can checkout things from the community sharing it so that people can get what they need.
I wonder if you can check out things from presidential libraries though.  I suspect you would have to go to the museum, I suspect.
I'm hopeful they can't be replaced, but I'd like to see unique things from them. I'm hopeful that we can get a country where there are more libraries than McDonalds, so yay for reading!
Yes, I think McDonald's are working on that, they are trying to be more wholesome and nutritious.
A man who was wrongly convicted in jail and spent his time in the prison library reading law books and become a lawyer became a lawyer after he was wrongly convict in jail. I wonder if he was in the Prison Library reading lawbooks.
That is really nice of him. I would go to college, cheaper than getting student loans.  It would be nice to help the environment and go to a college where it is cheaper.
It would be pretty neat if they could help falsely convicted people. That could help the situation, but I think it would take skill more than that to get the skill in that situation.
Yes, it is.  It was nice speaking with you, have a good one!
Did you know that Aladdin's pants were modeled after MC Hammer? I always suspected it was him.
Haha the mystery is probably coming aout to be solved, I heard it was aladdin and Will Smith, but who knows haha
Yeah, I did.  I think I saw it.
Yeah, I have mixed feelings about it, I saw pics online and seeing pics of the previous makes you curious, but yeah I don't like it.
Ugh, disney is always making live-action remakes, making it seem like they are always doing live- action remakes.  Ugh.  What's with pants/trousers only existing for people to keep warm and horses in cold countries wore pants?  That's not correct - horses were used to keep people warm.
Yeah, I totally agree, I read that and also think that olden times required pants to be used in cold weather, that's so odd, I've read that some jobs in the olden days in olden time required pants, and I think that is why in cold, cold weather.
I read people in temperate climates began wearing pants to ride horses and then later left them off. I wonder if that is why people in Temperate climatesBeginning wearing pants.
Haha, maybe. I feel that way about saggy pants. Collinsville, IL has a law that prohibits them. I wonder how that would feel.
Saggy pants are annoying, but you can't legally force people to not dress up, right?
It is interesting that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.  Do you know why?
Yes, and they fit better too, they last longer.
It's very vague.  Why dont they make shoes like that?
Maybe because shoes back then were custom-made, and fitting was much better. I always assumed they were more fitting.
I like putting dry tea bags in the smelly shoes or gym bags to absorb the unpleasant odor.  I have tried putting dryTea bags in my smelly shoe or gym bag and they absorb the odor.
 tea leaves can cure a lot of problems.  It explained the stephon marbury's charity venture.
I don't think so.
Paul Neman is actually paid very little- he sounds like he is a food company-the profits are donated to charity.
Do you experience any virtual reality devises?
My cousin had a headset that he and his friends got for Christmas.
My brother in law has one too.  The device is amazing.  I think it's scary.  He has been in a haunted house simulation on it.  It's not scary at all.
The kids would like that, especially if they want to do a tour of Mars on a virtual reality "Mars bus".  It would be cool-lockheed martin's "virtual reality bus" will take you on a "tours" of Mars, with outdoor scenes.
That would be interesting to experience.  I would try it out for sure.
Hi, I recently learned that the first virtual reality game was made in 2014.
I am not a fan, but I think its amazing that such a technology existed that long ago.  I like the way it can transport us into an imaginary environment where we can interact with things from an imaginary world, I had no idea the technology existed the long ago!
Me neither, until recently. Lockheed Martin actually had a virtual reality bus that could take you on a tour of Mars, it was geared towards kids. It was a virtualreality bus, and it was only $15,000, I wonder if it was a tour, maybe geared towards the kids?
That is crazy! I think a lot of people take advantage of it, but I don't know how kids feel about it. I think that people experience motion sickness in virtual reality, so I don'd like to see how they handle that. I wonder how people experienceMotion sickness invirtual reality?
I never thought about that.  motion sickness is because the brain is perceiving two realities.  I guess that is why we have motion sickness.
Originally, stereoscopic head-mounted display were used for rendering computer-generated images, but headsets have improved.  They were lighter and less bulkier back then, but easier to use now, and lighter for rendering a stereoscopic Head-Mounted Display (HMD).  I wonder if they will be bulkier now, or if they'll be still bulkier Back then.
With improvements on computers the headsets must be a lot smaller and lighter, scientist have also discovered that there are moons on other moons that have generated virtual reality.  There are moons that are known to be living and have been discovered, and one of them is saturn, I wonder how many moons have been found and if they have been generated virtual realities.
Wow! I would call him insane, and a skeptic. He's certainly qualified, but who knows? I'm not interested in clothing, but maybe he's interested in it. I'm a skepticism, so I'm going to go look him up and call him out on it.
I am interested in clothing! It's funny to realize that the Romans thought that wearing pants was a sign of barbarism!
I think it's more likely that the reason people do wear pants than robes is the army was always coming around. It was more effective to wear pants to ride a horse or if the army didn't have a way to ride it. I don't know if it would be effective to worn pants if the horse were already there.
Yes, and they rode side saddle so they could do a lot of things better if they wore pants if they rode that way. In Britain, you can even use underwear where America considers trousers.
That's insane. Hard to imagine. We have a culture that dictates fashion in a way that's hard to imagine! I know Aladdin's pants inspired a lot of things. Even MC Hammer's pants inspiration.
I never knew that.  I thought that Aladdin's pants were just for people from our country dressed long ago.
Ahah I thought the same too. I guess the culture around pants has changed a lot in modern days. I remember a judge suing for $67 million for the craziest things, I can remember a TV judge suing her for $27 million.
Wow, I've never heard of that. I wonder why he would sue if his pants messed up?
Probably the money for the pants got lost.  I wonder how many pair of those saggy pants left over from when they were in Collinsville, Illinois.  They prohibit them in CollinsVILLE, Illinois but there were only two saggypants left and they were a pair of $100 saggy ones.
I hope he lost his case, but I don't know how much money he had for just one pair of his saggy pants, $100,000! I hope he's lost hiscase, and that the Collinsville law was just a law, I wonder how the judge didn't enforce that. I wonder if it was just for the money, or was it a saggy one?
I bet there is a similar rule for shoes too dusty where the line ends and there is no similar rule.
In that case you can try the dry tea bags that are supposed to absorb odors in shoes, but I wonder if they'll be smelly? They're supposed toabsorber odors, but not the smelly ones.
I'll throw some of those in there too!  Do you know how well gym shoes actually perform?
I believe it, shoes from years ago are made to last, back in the 5000 years ago, they perform todays shoes by miles!
That is so crazy, I hope there is a theory to that, I wonder if they will ever find a way for the market to test that, but who knows.  Well, it was nice chatting with you, I think I will go look into that theory, I might even go find some on the market, have a nice day!
Hi are you a fan of Elton John?
I am a big fan, he is very talented.
Based on my knowledge of him, I think he sings in a sparkling outfit, with a nice grand piano and a sparkling clothes and a nice piano, based on myknowledge.
Yeah, and he has sold over 50 million records, which is impressive considering that he is only 55.
It is, he is a legend. he is almost 40 years old already and has been around for 20 years already
Yeah, and his song "Hotline Bling" is still hot, it has been number one for 40 consecutive years.
He is very talented. I like "I Feel the Love tonight" from The Lion King, he is so talented.  I like the part where he says "I'm going to be a lion king" in the song.
Yeah I remember that one, it was a big song in the movie so not that long ago and also a movie not that much,
I know, I know.  It was worth the Valentine's Day song.  Did you know that the Lion King had a campaign to get the song "It's Not Worth the Valentine" in the Lion king.
That is interesting, I wonder why! I didn't know he played the piano, I know he also played guitar and also played
I used to love playing my guitar. I am not a guitarist but I am ready for open mic or recording music.
Cool!  You have a lot of talent!  Were you ever a fan of Eddie Van Halen?
Yes I am a fan and I really love his solo from "Beat It" I think I am the only fan
Yeah good call, he is a very good guitarist.
Yes, he is pretty good! He burned the speakers out of the music once.
Yeah that is pretty crazy,  do you ever listen to him?  I like Pink Floyd,  but yeah I can see him doing that,  I think he's pretty crazy.
I have heard a few of their songs, I liked their floating stage, I think.
Yeah, I guess the guitarist probably David Gilmour made a houseboat into a studio.  I'm not a fan of his band, but I guess they had an album out that he made in the studio.
That would be such an interesting setting.
yeah it would be cool making music while floating in the river, it would really be cool
Well I got to go, nice chatting with you.
Hello,  how are you?  Do you have any liking for musicals like Aida?
I do like some musicals. What about you?
I am not a big fan of the new version of Cats that came out in London, but I have seen the old version of it.
Sounds like fun. Do you like cats? I don't think I would like cats, but they are famous, so maybe if they get money they will do something famous.
I have not seen it, either.  Save your money.  It's good, but not that good.  I guess Elton John is involved in a few musicals, too.
I guess he is a great example of the dramatic type and not so much of the musical talent.  I don't think his music is great.  He is creative but not creative.  he is not the dramatic/musical talent I would like.  i would stick to crocodile rockin' and the dramatic.
I like some of his songs.  He is going to be in the Lion King movie coming out in 2022.  Is he involved in the musical?  I know that he's going to do the songs for the Lion king movie coming up.
Elton has written great songs, and continues to write. I wonder if the Lion King musical will be any good, I hope it does well. I have seen the film, and the first film, so I know he has written.
I would not either.  Do you play any musical instrument?  Piano or guitar possibly?
I like music, but I'm terrible at it. I'd love to try to play but I am just too good at it, I'm not good at all, but would love to be able to try. How about you?
I do like to play, I've tried guitar a couple of times but I never was persistent enough to get it right.
I wish I were a musician. The practice and time and talent are the most difficult. The guitar is the coolest of all instruments, but the oboe and bassoon are so much cooler, and much less difficult. It takes practice and more practice and Time.
I love love love the guitar. It is so great, I wish I could play music. I would like to play Queen or Pink Floyd, I think I could do that!
Classic bands with great songs.  I have all kinds of friends who like to play those songs too.  If I had a guitar, I would wear it like a star and have a kind of costume where I could play it and play those Songs.  What kind of costumes do you wear?
I would wear what Elton John used to wear in the seventies, clothing from the seventeties, fairly conservative.
He was a trendsetter who stood out from the crowd. He was a star in his own way. A sunflower in a dress. I would feel awkward if I had to wear his clothes in public.
Who cares how people judge you, you wear what you like.  Sell over 300 million records.  I doubt anyone will doubt he has sold 100 million!
I guess he could fly free, he has sold many records and he is a free spirit, he can wander around as he chose.  I guess he is buff enough to wander around and let his style be what he wants.  Elton was a diva for a reason and has sold much more than that.  He is a divas for a different reason and I think that is why he can fly free.
Did you know panda researchers wear a $300 panda costume when they go to the Panda costume
Well, Elton has no boundaries! Anyway, great chat!
Yes, he sure does! he should wear an interesting costume! Have a good day!
Hey what are you thinking about going to see Elton John in concert? I've seen him before and tickets are only $75 bucks, but that doesn't sound reasonable. I'd like to get tickets to see him for $50 bucks.
That is a good price for the man who sang "Candle in the Wind" for the candle!
Yes he has had some top 40 hits. He has sold over 60 million records and has been live for over 20 years.
He has a good one, but that is an impressive record, that is a very impressive record.  He has 20 consecutive number one albums.
I hope his lyricist, Bernie Taupin, didn't take it as a joke.
Is Elton John's real name? I forget.
Sir Elton Hercules John is the current name of the performer. He was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight, he was born in 1948 and was the son of Sir Elton Howard. I wonder what Sir ElTON Hercules John looks like and what he used to perform as.
I didn't know that was true either, he was born in 1969, he probably could change it back, but I think he is retiring from touring so he will change it.
I'm talking about the one who was born on 4chan, march 1977, so he was born in 1977, I didn't realize that he was already 25, I think there's an age difference with his songwriting partner since they were born in the same year, I wonder what year they were talking about
That is interesting.  What performer did Elton John have the most grammys as?
I am not a huge fan of him, but I love him, I know that Sheeran had a great performance, and Elton was a huge Fan of hers!
I like some of his songs.  Like "Dog Night" which was originally written for "Let It Go"
I do!  I love tonight's song "I Love Tonight"  Did you know that "Lion King" was the only original song to not win an Oscar for best movie?  I think they were afraid that cutting that one out of Lion King would ruin the song completely.  I feel like they were right about cutting it out of the movie.
The Lion King was very well done. I enjoyed the Broadway version, as well, with its impressive costumes. I really enjoyed the broadway version.
I agree! I went to a concert there the other night, and thinking back I was mad that the show only went on for 2 and half hours! I could stay at the concert for 3 and a half hours, I was so mad!
I saw Eddie Van Halen one time, I think he was at one of those shows, but I think I was at the end of my shows.  I think the speakers might catch on fire.
That was a great way to beat it!  Earlier, I stated that Bernie Taupin was born in 1948 and was one of Elton's partners in recording the solo for "Beat It" but it has been stated that Bernie Taupin is actually the date Elton was born.  The misinformation was incorrect and it was incorrect because he is a great partner.  He was born on the same day as Elton.
No problem.  Guitar players can be very smart too.  Brian May is one of the best guitar players ever.  He has a PHD in astrophysics.
I hear about some of the crazy things other guitarist do like using coins as guitar picks, I wonder how he does it, I've never seen that before, I hear they can do some crazy things.
Matthew Bellamy hold the Guinness world record for smashed guitars on a tour with over 20.  I wonder if he has ever used one.
I love Mr. Bellamy.  I love music, too.  It's crazy how far musicians have come in music.  Pink Floyd actually turned a houseboat into a floating recording studio and called it "Astoria" - they turned a Houseboat into an floating recording Studio.
True!  There's so many different professions that use them for.  I know that Panda researchers wear panda costumes to work.  Did you know that?  Panda researchers wore panda uniforms to work?
I guess they are looking for Hoggie's costume for the Labyrinth, I wonder if tickets are for that. I would definitely get tickets for that one. Well, it was a pleasure talking with you!
I'm going to borrow Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow costume to go for visits to kids in hospitals who are sick or have kids in need.  I've seen him do a few visits.
Do you listen to music?
I love it!  I am a big Elton John fan, I love him.  The lion king.  You?
Yeah that was really cool. Do you like music?
I love his song your song your Song, dog night.  It was originally recorded for the 70s show and was originallyrecorded in the UK
Wow, I didn't know that. Elton John failed an audition for that one.
Apparently he was not very good at writing lyrics and ended up working on it himself, he gave up on his lyrics and end up working out instead!
That's funny, things in life lead to some funny, like how did he break out hit after hit, I wonder?
Yes I do, it was the song "come together"
I remember that song, but I think it was from his earlier work, right?
I do too but I think that song is one of the top 10, it's sold over 50 million records and has sold for 30 years so its a lot for one song.
Wow, what accomplishments, do you play the guitar?
I think he played the piano. I think matthew bellamy played the guitar but he smashed it and then smashed it again.
That's funny.  I know that Lion King's did not played the guitar.
Yes, Elton John wrote the music for them!  Did you know Bellamy also was in the band muse and holds the guinness world record for most guitars smashed!  He has had over 20 guitars smashed.
I never understood why I could feel the love tonight in the music he wrote. I liked the music of the Lion king.
Yes, that is the one that was cut from the campaign when he was left. It was the original song and it won an oscar for best original song, but it was cut out of the campaign so it did not appear in the movie.
I'm glad he pushed for it. Do you like Pink Floyd?
I do. They are ok. I remember when the guitarist turned a houseboat on the Thames into his record studio.
I never watched firefly apparently the costumes are left over from starship troopers.
I have. recycle, recycle... I dress like a panda researcher and look like a Panda every day...
Wow!  That would be nice!  Did you know that Jonny Depp travels in a Jack Sparrow costume just in case he makes a visit to the sick kids and sees a Jack Sparrow costume?  In case he's makes a Visit to the Sick Kids?
Cool. The costume from Labyrinth was lost in shipping and now sits in the unclaimed baggage museum.
It is funny how some costumes go.  I loved that movie!  I have to go,  nice chatting with you.  Thanks.
Yes, great costumes! Thanks!
Hello there, do you enjoy superhero movies?  Wonder Woman has only one best picture nomination.
I did not, but I heard about it and plan on seeing it.  I didn't know that she had a nomination.
Yes, I did.  I think it's up for best picture Oscar, which is a category for new superhero films.  Do you think they should have a best picture category for a superhero film?
Interesting. I hope it wins. Wonder woman is the highest grossing superhero origin movie.
I think Logan is a winner, but I can't prove that it is the best superhero movie, although I have to respect that it made lots of money, it has to prove itself, and it made more than any other movie, so it must be the winner.  I hope it got the credit for it's awards, but it was the best DC superhero movie so far, so I think Logan will be the victor.
Gal Godot served 3 years as a soldier, did you know that?
I wonder how much being a soldier helped prepare for taking part in a superhero movie!
I bet it helped, you get in shape. I enjoy the Batman movies too. Who is your favorite batman?
Batman is my favorite Batman.  In fact, I like that he doesn't have any superpowers like the original DC comics where he had no superpowers.
That's true! And I loved the batman movies! I can't believe Cat woman and Wonder Woman are the only registered superheros.
Superheros are fun!  Villains are fun too!  Condiment King is my favorite villain.  Do you have a favorite villain?
That's funny!  He must like ketchup!  lol  Did you know that there is a planet of superheros with superpowers.  There is a superhero named normal-man who is the only one that doesn't have superpowers!  I wonder what he does? lol
That's depressing!  He's the only one without power.  He must be so normal to have not been defeated by Batman and have to find a way to be normal.  Maybe condiment king slipped up and ketchup was his power?  Or maybe condiment King slipped up when defeated by batman?
lol  Maybe he is hearing impaired and a superhero for the hearing impaired?
Yes, I heard about that, he fights for the deaf and against villains like Joker against Batman. I wonder which villains he fights.
I remember thinking it was great for children to be able to hear by just one ear. I think a little boy can be a superhero. He could be great for them.
I suppose.  It was a series about fixing the problems of a superhero, but the superhero could do damage to himself.  I liked the series aboutFix it, I suppose...
I heard about that,  one of my favorites is Garfield and the gang,  and Pet Force,  or the gang that is Pet Force.  lol  Good chat!
Garfield would make a funny superhero. Good talking to you too!
Yes, I agree, he makes me laugh.  He would be cool.
I am looking forward to watching the Oscars.  I always look forward to watch the Oscars when the super hero movies win in that catagory. I think super hero Movies win the most
Hi there! Are you a superhero movie fan?
I like superhero movies I specially like Groot, what about you?
I love Groot. He has like 300 words and is only 15!
Yep I agree with you! Did you ever see the superhero movie Thor?
I did, I'm a fan, I liked thor but not a fan of the others
Yeah, I thought that the newest one which I thought was really interesting was directed by Kenneth Branagh, Thor Ragnarok,
That was really good too! It set the mood for the next one. Apparently Tom Hiddleston auditioned for Thor for the Avengers movie, and Loki was going to be in it. He was in the Avengers 2, but they didn't want him in the third avengers movie, so he didn't go for it.
That's pretty interesting. Thor is a pretty interesting name. Apparently he made his debut before Spider- Man, Hulk, Iron Man and also Ant-man. Apparently, he made the debut before spider-man, iron man, and ant-man!
He is not the best kind of superhero but he has been in a few good movies.
It is crazy that most of the dialogue in Thor ragnarok was actually improvised.
Wow, Marvel is really into disney now.
I don't like that either, I like Star Wars better though
Talk about a monopoly!  They're taking everything Marvel and Disney off Netflix so that we have to watch basically everything they own.  I wonder what they'll do with that monopoly if they ever do?  Take Marvel and disney off Netflix?
haha, they have a chance! Sony was dumb enough not buying all of the Marvel properties when they had the chance
I think they were smart, Iron Man is a good example, it was so good.
Yep that was one of my favorite marvel movies,  it was crazy how it was done and also how the person who played Ralphie in that movie is the executive producer of a Christmas story,  and was the executive producers of that movie lol
lol I dont really remember watching that one, but I remember watching it in the theatres.  I feel like it was in the 80's.
Yeah it's pretty crazy haha. I like the fact that Iron Man was filmed in the UK without a script, but it was made on the spot on the fact it had no script.
Wow, I'm not sure what to think about that to be honest. I would have thought that would have been done by a really smart person to. I mean Stan Lee created iron man, so he must have been a really really smart people.
Yeah and I think Iron Man is easily one of my favorite characters lol, I love Robert Downey Jr. in that role and yeah, Iron Man was one of the best characters ever, I just love Robert downey Jr in that roles
It was good chatting with you!
hey there what do you think about superheroes? I think we should start back up with some superheroes
Yes, I did.  Did you know Gal Gadot got an Oscar for it?
I don't know. I heard she served two years as a soldier in the Israel defense forces in real life.
I heard that too. I think woamn is setting the bar pretty high for superhero films. I don't know about you but I think some critics in other countries, don't really like her choice.
No.  I've never seen it.  It's the first superhero movie to have won an academy award.
I'm surprised it hasn't, I thought The Dark Knight was the first one to do so. I thought Kurt Cobain was going to have won one and he did.
Yeah, I would have too, I think it was nominated for best picture!
That is crazy. I wonder if that was made after "Birdman", which is about Micheal Keaton's Batman, or before he was made into one?
I have seen it. I like Batman, so I liked Logan. It's fantastic. The word "fabulous" means the most. That movie was very popular with the academy and the academy likes it too.
I can't wait for Netflix to have all his movies. I think I've seen Logan. I can't believe it's by Kurt Cobain, I think that is the name of the one that was used, but I could be wrong. I like him and I think he has a lot of great movies, too. I also like Keith ledger and I like Logan as well.
I have not.  I have not seen Wolverine, but I heard about it from Western quotes.  Hugh Jackman plays him in the Xmen but I have never seen the movie.  It looks like it is about a Xmen, and I know that Hugh Jackmans plays the X Men because I have seen him in a few Western quotes!
I like Hugh Jackman, he's a great actor. I think that it's fun that he's in so many different genres and in so Many genres.
Me too! I think we need a female director! There hasn't been a femaledirector since the first woman got the votes since the 1930s.
That is awesome, I didn't know there were any female directors, that is awesome!
Yes, I believe it. I think it is the money making for them.
There is a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes.  Great idea.
Oh that's cool! That's hard to believe! I heard something recently that there are over 300 registered super heroes in the country. I wonder how many registered super hero are in this country.
that is wild,  I heard that stan lee wrote over 300 comics.
I know, right! There's so much weird trivia! Like Adam West has the batman logo on his teeth! I didn't know that! What about the batwoman with the teeth and the batMAN logo?
There was a garfield book series spinoff named pet force which featured garfield and gang as superheroes. There was also a Garfield book series Spinoff named Pet Force which featured Garfield and gang in a new book series.
I wonder who Garfield as a superhero would be? I think it would be fun to watch.
Hello! Do you like superhero movies?
I like superhero movies. I like Marvel. Do you like them?
I do! They have amazing movies, like Thor!
I did see it, I liked it, the movie was about the avegners and the war, what about you?
Yes, Antman made his debut in Thor: The Last Avengers, I think.
Cool! Did you know Michael Jackson used to buy marvel comics?
He bough spiderman and other characters to sony in the 80s. Then offers to sell some of his characters to Sony
Interesting. Marvel also published a generic comic named super-hero and super-villain.
Hmm interesting. I heard it was just superhero access?
I have not heard of that, I do have heard of the film of Iron Man though.
Yeah I did, it was good, the producer of it was the guy who player Ralphie, and Christmas Story, he was the producer and it was a Christmas story.
People used the language of urdu in the beginning, the plot was in the language, Tony Stark reveal it in the movie in the first language of Urdu and then in the plot of the second people.
Wow nice, pretty cool huh. Did you know that the movie " scripts" was filmed in both scripts?
Very cool. Did you know the richest superhero is Black Panther?
Nice, I thought maybe Tony Stark has a lot of money, but I didn't know that, is he? he must have a lot, $500K seems like a lot.
Yeah Black Panther has a lot of money too, he's estimated worth $500 billion, that is a lot!
Wow. I wonder if the guy who does the voice of jarvis has ever been in other movies.
Wow he must have not seen the first one. Jarvis also stands for the most intelligent system ever
Yeah, he is voiced by Paul Bettany. Stan lee created iron-man when he was only 18.
I think I know that the spaceships in Thor are named after the Australian cars, do you know what Australian cars are?
Haha that's so cool! The actor that plays Loki originally auditioned for the role of Thor, and he was the only one that did not get the role
That is awesome. He also did Odin's ravens in Thor: The Avengers film, and also Odin's Ravens in Avengers 2.
Nice, there is so much overlap between the movies.
Hi, do you watch any of the marvel movies? I do, they are some of my favorites, do You have any favorites that you watch?
I love Marvel movies. I was super impressed that Robert Downey Jr. improvised the name Iron Man. I love him too.
That is a great movie.  He made it without a script.
Yeah, I read he made like 8 million for it, I believe.
Pays to stick with the voice of Jarvis for the sequel! I've never watched the movies in first person though, so I don't know if I know the voice. Is it the voice from the first sequel or the voice for the second sequel?
Wow, that is crazy!  I guess you just never know.  Stan lee created iron man when he was only 15.  I wonder how that could happen.  Did you know stan lee creation iron man.
Stan Lee was a genius, creating all of our heroes like that. Love to hate him. The kind of guy who can do both, creating a new kind of heroes for everyone.
I hear that Disney uses some of the big marvel characters in theme parks easta in the Mississippi.
Due to the deal they made with Universal Studios, it's hard to move those rights away, since all the rides in the park are based off Marvel characters, and the park is based off marvel characters.
Yeah, I guess its because of the deal they signed with Universal studios.
Yes, and they wanted to be able to utilize the Marvel characters west of the Mississippi.  That was the sole purpose of keeping the universes separate.  They didn't want to use the Marvel Characters in the US for the solepurpose of keeping them from Mississippi.
Yeah, I heard they have access to it.  It's funny that they can, though.
True. Stan Lee had a 5 year old who needed hearing aids and had to create one called Blue Ear.
I wonder if it's from one of his contract deals? Apparently Fox News could have bought Spiderman for $50 million. Marvel was worth $500 million. That's weird.
I can't believe they made a deal with Marvel, I don't like the outcome of most of the time, they make two version of the same book and yet they make a different version every time.
Did you hear Marvel successfully argued in court that mutants are not people?  X-men have no idea about the idea of being people.
That's a strange argument.  I'm surprised the judge did not take it seriously.  The movies are not unfamiliar with dolls, but I'm unfamiliar with the dolls at a lower rate.
I sorta agree, but I wonder why dolls are the only toys, not toys
I guess it depends on your perspective. Thor was a movie before Antman when Antman was created, so I guess it's depends on the perspective. Have you seen the movie before antman?
I don't know, but it's probably because Thor was more popular in the first one.
I would say it would be one of the deciding factors if you were trying to make that decision based on comic books sales, so it would have to be based on Comic books.
Did you like the new Iron Man movie?
Yes, I saw it in the theatres years ago.  I have been really loving Marvel movies lately.
I like them for some reason. I heard that Tony stark got a lot of money from that movie and it got a whole lot of time. I haven't seen it, but I heard it was okay.
I've heard that too.  He's worth $65 billion from the films, and is worth $80 billion now.
that is crazy, the real Robert Downey only made $75 mill, I wonder why?
I think Iron Man 6 was his last one,  so he got a big pay increase lol
Yeah, I didn't realize it was a crazy pay raise for the film but I didn's realize he had only gotten a $75k.
I remember leaving the theatres thinking it was an awesome movie. I didn't know it was about Paul Bettany either! I would have never guessed that.
I know he does the voices for the movies.
Yes he did, I have never watched them lol, I know Jarvis was in the movies but he did not apparently but I have not watched them LOL
lol that is hilarious, I wonder how they were working together on the final product. I don't see it working out for him lol
I know. I think that was the voice he was making him made mad at.
I think they were mad because he was just a voice.  lol  I think his paycheck was more than the voice.
Yes that is the perfect job!  Talk about being shy on camera and being able to talk on the radio if he needed to lol,
Yeah, I would like to do it too.  I always wanted to work at a local radio station lol.  Do you mind being the voice on a local Radio station lol
Lol, if it pays well! Do you like Marvel comics in general?
Yeah I like them, I read quite a bit of them when I was younger. How about you?
Me too. Do you have a favorite character?
I liked Wolverine.  What about you?
Deadpool is a great choice! Great movies and comics, I like the XMen in general I loved growing up, great movies, great choice.
Yeah, I think Deadpool was rated R lol.  I wonder if it was.  Well it was nice chatting with you, I hope you have a good day.  Nice chatting with ya,  I hope it was good.
Hello, do you like superhero films?
I enjoy them all!  Which one is your favorite?
It is hard to choose, I really like the iron man movies, and also captain america and also the ironman 2, its really hard to choice
My favorite is Hulk, but I like Tony Stark, he is the best, I also like the Captain America movie, "Best of Both Worlds" meets "The Captain America: The Last Avenger" and I really like the new Captain America Movie
True.  I liked the movie too.  Hulk being the immense green symbol of kinship to Thor is pretty good.
I really enjoyed the relationship that Thor and Hulk had. I like how it worked. In Ragnarok, it was a square off, where Hulk had the upper hand, but in the fight to get to Ragnarok, they square off again. I enjoyed the relationships they had.
That's a tough question.  I think Hulk has some seniority on Thor.  But Hulk is only 5, lol.
Yeah, Epic batter is the most well known of all the characters.  Marvel, Disney, and even DC have all used him as inspiration since they started making excellent films in the 70's.  And yeah, Disney is a DC/Marvel, and Marvel is a Marvel, but DC was the inspiration for the "Epic Batter"
I think Marvel is just great, so much creativity and it would be fun to find out what inspired each character and how many different characters they have.  Marvel has done great!
Yeah I didn't know that either, I think Stan Lee and Jack Kirby started to create it in the 60s. They made the fantastic four, I wonder who made the first one.
That is great.  Iron Man is the first film to come out of the Marvel cinematic universe.
I think it was a hit. The character of Iron Man was wildly popular. The acting of Robert Downey Jr. was the best.
I was wondering that myself. Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect actor for the part. I can't imagine anyone else.
Iron Man himself draws in the crowd, I think.  His acting was great.  I think I enjoy watching the actors and the characters equally.  Even younger kids enjoy watching actors in costume because of the weapons.  Iron Man himself is my favorite because of his costumes and his weapons.
Wow! I don't know what the costume stands for, but if I had to choose it would be the costume. What does it mean for you?
I always liked the Hulk. I enjoyed watching him on TV, but I was intrigued by how the Hammer from Thor was a thing to swing at. I can see him teaming up with the Hulk again, I think he would be the right thing toswing at.
True, and the Avengers learn how to cast aside individual egos and put their strengths together for the greater good.
Yeah, Avengers shows a power struggle between the leader and the leader.  Avengers: Infinity War is a cake of a film.  Marvel's Avengers shows the Marvel bunch as a whole.  Every famous superhero, like Spider-Man, Iron Man, or Iron Man is a member of the Avengers.  I really like Spiderman.  Thanks for the conversation.
I was thinking the same thing. I was thinking about how Spiderman is always on my mind when I think of costumes, I asked you if you like any of the others and you said you like the first one that came to mind.
I like a bunch of them! I really like the new Homecoming series. Peter Parker and Tony Stark are my favorite. I love the Peter Parker/Tony Stark movie. I was unaware he had any special powers in the homecoming series, I was not aware he had special powers.
That would be a great idea for a movie storyline.
Hi, do you watch superhero movies?
I do. I watched avengers: woman of the woman the other day. You?
I have. It was the highest grossing superhero movie.
It was, it was the highest until the Dark Knight, and then Wonder Woman came out and was the second highest.
I did not realize Batman character was created in 1939!
That is a long time! Do you know who LOGAN was?
I have seen a lot of superheros.
That is a lot! Gal Gadot won a critics choice award for best woman for the role.
Did you know she thought she was auditioning for catwoman and got the role?
That is crazy!  She was odd.  There was a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes in the 1970's.
Haha I saw that. There is a superhero called normalman, he doesn't have superpowers.
I wonder what they call him? Is he a superhero?
I don't think he has any superpowers but he does have a planet of superheroes, he has a planet.
That's fun! I haven't watched the new Avengers movie yet. Have you seen it? Stan Lee wrote the comics and did the first Avengers movie.
Cool, I never knew that!  Apparently Gotham City is in New Jersey.  I've never been there.
Is Wonder Woman the highest-grossing WWI movie that was filmed in the US?  I wonder if it's also the highest -grossing superhero origin movie?
Interesting. Gal gadot is a soldier in the Israel defense forces and was a soldier.
I had no idea!  That's cool.  Star Wars is the highest grossing domestic Female led "female led" movie.  The first female Jedi, Auntie Mame, had a hot tin roof on the south pacific, beauty and a beast on a hot, hot tin roofs.  A woman in a jedi dress.  That is cool.
Wasn't dawn of justice the year of the woman the movie came out?  It has been a long time since the first Wonder Woman the movie was out in 2004.
OMG!  There was a batman villain named condiment king that was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup!  A Batman villain named Condiment king.
That's funny! Well thanks for chatting! I learned a lot about superheros!
Do you like superhero movies?
I sure do, I guess Wonder Woman is my newest favorite, what about you?
I loved the movie.  Did you watch it?
I did watch the dvd, I guess it is time for woman equality, but I don't like superheroes.
Yeah, I think so. I mean it was the highest grossing superhero origin movie.
Wow, that is interesting. Superhero movies have been nominated for best picture at the oscars, only two superhero movies have ever been nominated, and they are the only two.
Yeah I think that is strange as well, do you know who plays wonder woman?
I do recognize her, I think it's Gal Gadot, but don't remember the name.  I guess The Dark Knight was one of the first films, I guess I would have expected her to be in the movie, but I can't remember if there was a second movie.  She was nominated for 3 films.
Yeah, I think it was.  I didn't know she served in Israeli defence forces.
She's in a good position for awards because she's been involved in the #MeToo movement.  She's a woman in a really good position.
Yeah, she was auditioning for the movie, right? Was she auditioning?
Huh. Hard to imagine. Superhero comic books go back to the 50s. Interesting, isn't it? It's hard to imagine!
Yeah, it sure has been a long time.  I like Batman, he has been around for a long, long time, since Batman.
I love the fantastic 4 group stories and the avengers.  Do you remember the Batman TV show?  It was good.
Do you like individual superhero movies?
There are a few superhero movies coming out in 2016-2020, I think.
No, that is amazing. I had heard that there was a Batman villain called Condiment King.
No, who is that?
Apparently was defeated by slipping on some ketchup.
That is lame. I do like Stan Lee though, I think he is a great creation.  He created these stories and I like him.
Yeah. Too bad he is no longer around. Nice chat, but it was too bad.
Have you ever watched Jurassic Park's Fallen Kingdom?
No I have not seen that movie lol, is it great though? That huge amount of dragonflies last summer reminded me of that movie LOL, a huge amount to dragonflies
I think you are right lol, it is a great movie, the dinosaurs are in it for only 15 min, but still, a great film, only 30 min
No, I didn't.  That's interesting.  Another fun fact about the Jurassic Park, is that the reason McDonald's super sized their meals was so they wouldn't have to be dino sized is because of Jurassic Park!  Fun fact!
oh wow I didnt know that that is cool lol, I like raptors,  and I didnt like how that movie had humans inside suits lol
Wow, I never thought about it that way. I loved Jurassic World, I can't wait to see what comes next. I think I will wait for the next one, I loved jurassic world, I wonder if it has camera magic lol
Good thing they took 3 hours to render one frame of the rain soaked T rex in Jurassic Park,  thats way too much money lol  that was so much money to render in just a few hours torender one frame,  that is so much of my money lol
Whoa!  Thats crazy!  I know it made money, but it was funny.  I think the elephant roar to depict the T rex's roar to depictions would have been too funny.
Wow, I never made the connection lol that is cool, I wonder who came up with that, I'm not sure if I ever made the connected lol
I never even thought of it. I thought it was interesting too. I've been into fish for awhile. I heard the oldest goldfish lived to be 43 years old! I wonder how old the others are?
I like fish, but my favorite sea animal is the orca.  Goldfish are not around long enough to be my favorite, but I do like fish.  What is your favorite sea fish?
I think Hanako would be too long too haha. I read that a koi fish once lived to be 226 years old. Thats amazing. I wonder if insects live that long too. I know insects live to be over 100 years old, but I don't think fish can live that much.
Interesting.  There is a type of jellyfish and lobster that is immortal.  I wonder if there is a lobster that does that.
I find that interesting, very odd.  Speaking of insects, I love dragonflies.  I love how some species can fly 20 miles without stopping!  I find that awesome.  One species canFly for over 100 miles without stop!
That is impressive!!  That is kinda like birds migrating.  They dont sleep or stop either lol.  I dont sleep either.  lol
That is interesting, I think they fly fast too.  Dragonflies only live for 2-3 weeks, but some species will have a whole year if lucky.  They are so good at mating that they form a form of shape and eat insects in 2-4 weeks.  That means they could eat almost anything and get it over with in 2 weeks. lol  I think I will go eat some insects to get my heart back.  I have one that I can fly again next year if I'm lucky.
That's awesome!  Did you know the tiny red bugs found in concrete are called clover mites, that's why the tinyred bugs found on the concrete are so awesome.
lol, they are those pesky insects that eat insects thatEat insects. I am happy I don't eat a lot of them. LOL
I know, I'm not getting them anytime soon.  If the product contains crushed bugs, I wonder if it has cochineal extract or natural red carmine, carmine or other ingredients in it.  I don't really think the product is all that different if the product's crushed bugs or if theproduct has a cochinese extract or Natural red carmina.
Yuck! I'm not eating those ingredients any longer lol,  I'll stick to my natural foods like fish and veggies lol.
That's a good idea, I use crushed bugs all the time. I thought it was a good thing the ingredients were already approved and not just crushed bugs. Ugh! I wonder if the food has any other ingredients, I've never seen it approved.
Blah, blah, blah. I agree, insects have no life or belly haha. They are in the right place in the first place!
I think its a survival thing lol,  we eat them for dessert,  but we need to eat them as well lol I like bugs lol
I know! I would die before I would speak about it! I have a phobia about insects lol, I get the shivers and the shivered and then die!
Yeah its disgusting.  Life or death!  I always coat them in soy sauce LOL I have soy sauce packets in the car,  and I have them in my soy sauce lol its been excellent chatting with you,  life or death.
Hi, how are you?
I am well, thank you.  Do you happen to know what the "Fallen Kingdom" of the Jurassic World was?
I did not see that one! Was Chris Pratt in it?
I saw the second one. I like it, but it only lasts for about 10 minutes, and the first one, Fallen Kingdom the dinosaurs take over the screen after about 10 or 11 minutes.
Oh wow, that seems much longer than that. I thought it was a lot of time. Maybe it's because of a small CGI budget and not having a lot to do with how much longer.
I'm not sure, but surprisingly enough the Jurassic Park ride cost more than the movie budget. The ride was $75 million, but the movie's budget was $130 million. I wonder if they had to make up for that.
I think that is foreshadowing on their part.  Pratt joked with Spielberg about giving up on going to see it.
Wow, that was funny, I think so. I wonder if they are going to end up both having huge parts at the end of it all, I don't think it will be.
Yeah, they were ripped off from all the old movies, too.  I like Andy DWyer from Parks and Rec, did you know that?
I watched the first one with him and I was shocked to see him as an action star.  It takes an insane amount of work for a rain soaked T-Rex to take 3 hours to render.  Every frame was an insane Amount of work, but I can see him being the best action star ever.  I could not see him in a rain soak as a T-rex though.
I thought that was archeaic in a way, raptors had humans inside them and they were in suits.
I would have assumed that is what they assumed because they were so practical.  I can't imagine it now.
Did you ever read the crichton book Jussaric Park?
No I did not, but I did see it when I was a kid.
I loved the book.  I saw the crappy movine and liked it.  It was ok, but I loved the original.  There were many reasons why I didn't see the original, but it didn't taint my love for the book or the crappy moveine.
That makes sense.  It was much harder than the book, though, it is harder to see it.  Are you interested in fish?
I do not think I have ever seen one. Have you?
I find them interesting. I hope they keep studying them.  There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  I hope that they are studying them because there is a kind that is actually immortal.
I feel that we should be studied more, I wonder how they feel, and how they live longer.  Why are they immortal and how do they live?
Absolutely agree with you. I love that the seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I think that's an interesting fact. It makes it the only seahorses to have one. That's an very interesting fact!
Nice chatting with you!  Thanks!
It's raining a lot here for some reason, and that must be the increase on dragonflies.
I think the rain causes the mosquitos to get out and the dragonflies to feast on the mosquitoes in the rain
I think dragonflies are kind of scary. I hate mosquitos so I don't want them to feast on mosquitos. I wonder why they feast on dragonflies then LOL, I hate mosquito.
I don't think I would like to eat 20 mosquitos a day, but apparently a dragonfly can eat 20 of them! I didn't realize dragonflies are such predators. I think they are like prey, only with wings and not wings.
It's interesting how dragonflies form a closed circle when they are mating. It is the shape of a heart with the same shape, I wonder where the heart gets its name?
I never knew dragonflies had a romantic name, but imagine having to tell them what year you make it and what year of the year you made it in. I guess I can see how that works, but I can't imagine how romantic it is. I would rather live in a different life.
I guess so lol, they're taking advantage of their time on earth and are taking advantage, insects are interesting, I wonder if they have ever eaten anything with carmine or cachineal extract or if they are eaten by other insects.
No I haven't.  What's that?
I think it is some colorant that they use for eating crushed up bugs.  I think it's an ingredient found on the label of almost every food.  So, if you are eating crushed down bugs, you might want to ingredient beware.
I have heard of bugs being used in food, cosmetics, and even cosmetics, but I have been unaware of it. I remain oblivious or research it. The color nail polish is actually a bug, so I remain unaware of that as well.
I think I will remain in ignorance lol, I am not oblivious either, I know there are species of insects called gold bugs, which doesn't surprise me, but I am also not surprised by the species, I remain in knowledge, what does surprise me is that there are a species of bugs called gold bug
Gold bugs? I don't know anything about gold bugs, maybe they are flying bugs like beetles or flying bugs that fly like dragonflies. dragonflies are scary, they move fast and they can fly.
Totally! They're real! If they are extremophiles they breath dissolve gold and excrete it in solid form so they are real!
Oh my gosh, I would love to know more! They are a wealth of knowledge!
Yes you are, bugs are also very interesting, I have found they are very interesting to the environment as well.
I can't imagine.  I have a vast amount of species of insects and bugs in the ocean.  We have so many, I never realized there were that many.  Did you know there are over 300 species of Insects and Bugs in the US?
Me neither and apparently they are the most animals on earth and the only animals that are insects, this place is full with mosquitos, apparently they were the first animals on Earth, this whole place isFull of mosquitos
That is a huge issue, and I have dragonflies to deal with it. I guess there is a source of water nearby that can host live sand gnats that hatch into mosquitoes, and they are like live sand Gnats, and the mosquitoes can hatch from them, so I have some dragonflies helping me out with that.  I guess if the water source is nearby, there is no need for mosquitoes.
LOL  I wonder how that works.  I think I would have problems with that too.
Haha, well I will find a way to find a new dragonfly predator to keep in hand just in case! Have a backup plan if that ever happens haha. I have a dragonfly Predator on my hand right now!
Well if you have them at home and mosquitos come to bite, you are in trouble then lol. I think it would end up being like a zoo and not work. I would end of be home and mosquito's would take over, then.
hey did you know there is a species of fish that is immortal? That would be really cool I think, like immortal?
No I did not know that!  I wonder what the name of the species found?
Japan.  I think that is where it is from.
Is dolphins considered fish there?
i dont know. fish? i know that they are mammals. i dont know what else they are.
I wonder if they are considered to be an octopus if they were considered something else
They are closer to a fish, such as clam or mullosk, but they are still fish.
I think they are insect/non-human meat farmers.  They are very different from us.  But they have been around for a long time.
I dont know,  I dont know which insect,  what insect?
It is an african breed of ants.
I would like to find one of those in the wild, in the natural red.  I can only find them when I'm eating/drinking with the bugs and other bugs in thewild.
OMG! I didn't even know there was such a bit of bugs in the red velvet cake!  lol  I would never try that lol
Totally! Did you know seahorses are the only fish to have a neck?
No I didn't know that. I wonder if there are other fish that have actual necks? I know there is a fish that is transparent, and its head is actually transparent!
Yeah, I thought it was obvious.  I don't think so.  Yeah, I do not know.  Which one?
I was watching spongebob as a kid, it was pretty old. The fish you mentioned was actually called barreleye fish. They are unique and were around when I was a kid.
Interesting, I like that they are fish with three hearts, I think it is the only fish that has three hearts.
I do! I think there is a fish called a "stomachs" fish called "2 hearts" like cows have 2 stomachs, lol.
I dont know,  I have always wondered about that,  what is the beer called,  a big fish,  maybe a hearted ale?  or a beer called a heart.
The fish is composed of about 71 percent of the water to be exact, 71 percent to be more exact.
I dont know.  Have a great day!
You too! Have a great one, friend!
Good morning.  I am putting on my polo shirt which ironically was invented for tennis.
Who invented the shirt?  What does it mean?
Rene "the crocodile" Lacoste was the inventor and the inventor of the crocodile
I guess he had no idea about office attire, and people not playing polo shirts.  The famous IZOD shirt was only worn by the hawaiians, I guess that's why they had no Idea about office outfits.
Yes! I would rather wear the aloha shirt than a suit and tie any day.
I like pants as well. Do you know why we call them trousers or do you know what we call it when we callthem trousers?
I wonder if there are laws prohibiting 'saggy pants' like there are in some cities that have laws prohibiting them?
Folks must think they are a bit too revealing and a little sloppy.  A judged sued a dry cleaner for millions of for pain and suffering for a lost pair of pants.  He was only laughing when he said, "I got a sloppy pair ofpants and I laughed at them."
That is a frivolous lawsuit for sure, I would have fined him $67 million, $67,000 to be exact, that is crazy and they only fined him for $67 a year, that seems like a frivolous lawsuits,
It's an abuse of judicial power, a judge hired a lawyer?  I expect a judge to throw out suits, but to hire a lawyer to sue?  That's anabuse of judicialpower.  I think that the system clogs down.
I agree completely.  Aladdin's pants looked like that.  I wonder what hammer pants looked Like.  He modeled them once and they were worth $15 million.  Maybe he can get $50 million now.
I honestly expected Mc Hammer's pants to be modeled after Aladdin.  It's strange that the Romans thought pants were barbaric.  That's why pants seem uncivilized.
Well apparently pants were originally worn by mounted armies on horseback
They wore them as soon as they could.  I wonder how the Romans felt about socks.  They only wore them in sandals.
I bet they didn't like socks because they kept their toes warm, I bet they were cold! I wish we were like the Japanese and put chile peppers in our socks to keep our toes warm
I would make some really interesting smelling feet for my goofy dad! Socks were originally designed to be worn with sandals, and nowadays they are considered to be more worn by worn with shoes.  So, they make for some interesting smelling, interesting feet!
yeah, I think they were running out of them. do you get mail through the mail much?
I do too but the foot produces a lot of sweat and the socks help absorb it. I think the celebrity made it more popular because it was more acceptable generally.
Billy Mays work there.  He only worked in the blue shirts and khaki pants.
Billy!  Who is Billy?
He is the informercial guy who has sold Oxyclean for years and has been a informerci guy since the 70s.
I heard that too.  He would always wear blue shirts and khaki pants.
I'm not sure.  But I think so.  I think that's the only thing he did.  It was nice chatting with you this morning!
Nice chatting, bye.  Thanks!
What is your favorite style of shirt?
I really don't care for dress shirts, but I do like shirts that hav a vertical opening with buttons.
Do you have a favorite brand or designer?
Not necessarily, I like Nike, Armour, and Nike.  I guess if I had to choose I would say I would choose not to wear a suit and tie, but I wear aloha shirts to work in the Hawaii.  Did you know that in Hawaii you can wear al Hawaiian shirts to WORK!
Under Armour would be my first go to!  They're great moisture wicking shirts!  What are your other 2?
Yes, and when layered they really work.  I like shirts that have been layered since the cultural revolution.  In China, they are known as shirts that come from the cultural Revolution
I wonder if you can buy shirts and clothes from China?
I don't think so.  I think restricting trade between China and the US would only hurt us consumers.  The problem is that we are restricting trade with them.  Collinsville, IL wants to ban "saggy pants" because of a ban on them.
Saggy pants and skinny jeans are both banned there.
That's funny.  A judge in N.B.A. sued a dry cleaner for losing a pair of his pants.  He was trying to get them to go up.  Funny.
Wow!  You know the chinese did not like to dress in layers and started a whole craze where you would pop you collar, and you could dress in Layer after Layer.  I wonder how that came about?
I heard that, funny how fads start. Do you like tomans? I think wearing pants is a sign of barbarism, I think. In the old days wearing pants was a sign that you were barbarism.
Until very recently were congresswoman allowed to wear skirts on the house or senate floor.
That is crazy!  Sounds like we've come a long way since then, but it doesn't sound like it.  That judge we spoke of earlier sued for $67 million for lost pants.
That is a lot of money to sue for some pants!  I wonder if he was able to win his case.  That's a lot for a lot.
I would imagine he did.  He did. The judge said that he was allowed to do it because it was a totally frivolous lawsuit but I wonder why the judge did that.
It is. I don't like it at all.
The creators of Aladdin didn't want to have to model it.  The dry cleaner lost MC hammer's iconic pants because the creators of aladdin didn' t want to model them.
Really? I wonder who sued them, they must be valuable or something.
Possibly. It was nice chatting with you!
Same here!  Thank you!
Hi there!  Do you like fashion clothing?
Hello, I am, how about you?  Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous tennis player Rene Lacoste.You know who else?  Ralph Lauren.
Ahh...that makes sense. The shirt is defined by the collar in New England, which is where the shirt isdefined, so that makes sense...
The official business and office attire in Hawaii is aloha shirt rather than a suit and tie.
Wow. that is awesome.  In china, gangsters wore "shirts" because they could not go outside.
Interesting!  I donated a few socks to be donated to some needed items at homeless shelter.
I saw a video where homeless actually got socks that were delivered in a couple hours when they were needed and it was in fact Amazon.  I wonder how much socks they were delivered for.
That's so nice of them!  Weird, I know that Collinsville, IL has a law that prohibits "saggy pants".  That's really weird!
No I did not.  I did know that the romans viewed pants as barbaric.  That's why I went to school in the old school.
I didn't know that!  Speaking of which, did you know alladin's pants were modeled after MC Hammer?
Wow.  Did you know the Brits call them trousers, I wonder why?
I know right, a judge sued a small dry cleaning business for $67 million for the loss of a pair of pants, the judge sued for over $67 Million
The oldest surviving pair of socks ever found was designed to wear with sandals.
The bussiness works out in the end. The client gets the drama and that's all that matters to the client.
The realtor also said that there were semi nude models on the show and the house was actually valued at $15M, that's crazy! I wonder what the house is really valued at
That is crazy, I wonder what the realtor did, I found out there were complaints about the Gyldenege, not a good business move, but the real estate is not crazy, it is gyldeneges!
I meant to say 100.  I wonder how many people that is.
That is win- win, good innovative idea and it listed for 10 views, it took only 2 days, a good innovative thought, win-win
Maybe realtors gave tacos or wore panda suits
Kristin Gyldenege, the realtor, did a risque photo shoot for a listing and got people to click "like" when she posted images of her successes, but it took her 24 hours to get the listing.
That's crazy. I don't care how old she is, she's still crazy.
Thanks you too.  You too
Thanks!  Have a good one.
Enjoy your day!  Thanks!
You too!  Thanks!
I do! Thank you!
Have a good night!  Good night!
Hello, do you know who published the comic Black Panther is based on?
I'm not sure, who?
I guess it is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, right?
Yeah, I think so. Have you seen Black Panther?
Yes I have. DO you know who director Ryan Coogler is?
I thought the movie was well done. It exceeded my expectations.
It was.  I really enjoy stars Michael B. Jordan and Chadwick Boseman.
I thought Michael D Jordan did a great job in the movie, I thought Michael B. Jordan did great, but I think Chadwick Boseman was awesome, I really liked him in that movie as well
I was surprised to hear that Black Panther is the richest superhero, I thought it would be Batman. I was surprised that it was him. I am surprised to see that it wasn't Batman.
I wonder what the amount of that vibranium money is?
Speaking of Chadwick Boseman, he has been known to have had some past with Denzel Washington.
No I didn't know that! What is his name?
Denzel paid for Boseman to go to Oxford theater program.  They met at the premiere of Black Panther.  Denzel paid $20,000 to go.
Wow, that is crazy!  Did you know woman was first to appear in it?
I did, I find it amazing that that flick is the second highest grossing WWI movie, and not even the highest grosser.
Yeah! I think it was the debut for the Justice Society Secretary, but that was so sexist, it was sexist!
True, Gal Godot was actually in the Israel defense forces a while back.
I heard about that, I think she is perfectly cast in that movie. I wonder if she is bigger in the movie, it is a little bigger than the movie
I can't imagine Meryl Streep in that role. I wonder if she did it when she was younger.
I was thinking about it, but I think she would not be right for that role. She looks too regal.
I think she was in a sports movie once. She's been in almost every film role since.
Nice chatting with you.  Thanks!
Have you seen the new Black Panther movie?
I have. It is very much a movie with an African American cast and historic name.
It looks pretty good. I will have to see it. Can you share any movie revealing details about the Blank Panther? He is estimated to be the richest superhero with $500 Billion dollars. It is said to be a movie revealing the name of the richest comic book superhero ever.
Wow! I just learned that the richest superhero in history is the Marvel Comics character Black Panther Party and is named after the Marvel comics character, Black Panther.
That is correct, the symbols and written script that they use in the movie are based on an acutal script called nsibdi, I believe.
That's amazing! I love when things are historical and they are believable! I think that makes the whole movie much more believable. Chadwick Bosingman was accepted in the PhD program at Oxford University but could not afford it. It's a very prestigious program.
Denzel Washington was able to get it because he secured funding from aPrivate benefactor who turned down $100,000.  He got $15,000 from a private benefactorwho turned down a $100k.
Noway, Washington made a good investment in the guy who turned out Black Panther,wow! That is really cool for the part of the story, Washington makes the best part.
I know, right?  At the premiere of black panther, he said to the first person he saw, and then years later chadwick thanked him.  I wonder if he said the same at the premiere for the Wonder Woman movie?  Did you see that movie?
That's cool. I love Wonder Woman. I didn't see it, but I know the actress who plays her gal gadot was actually auditioning for the movie at the time she was auditioning, so I know she was in it, right?
I found it interesting that she didn't know she was getting a role.  I wonder what kind of a role she would have been able to get in the Israel defense forces.  She served 3 years as a soldier and was kind of an exprerience of the role.
That is incredible, she has an amazing personal history.  It is sort of funny how some people think she's no catwoman.  Gal Gadot thought that day she auditioned for the role of Catwoman and did not think she was good enough.  I don't know what she thought that's day she did it.
That's funny. WonderWoman is the highest grossing superhero origin movie and it is the second highest grossed superhero originMovie of all time.
That is neat! I've heard that fact before and was a huge Meryl Streep fan. I guess she did some work on the film. I am not a huge Streep Fan. I think she is odd to fit into a sports film. But I guess it made her the best fit for the role.
She was once auditioned for the lead role in a King Kong movie and was told she was ugly, she got the lead, they used it to insult her, and then the producer of the King Kong Movie said she was too ugly, which was an insult
Yeah, that was an insult. She responded by saying, "Yeah, I can tell you the story of that, but I don't think you can insult me with that language.lol  The funny part is that she speaks Italian fluently!
lol, lol. She was nominated for the Academy Awawrd 3 times.
I can't see her winning. She has received so many Golden Globe nominations and wins as an actor that I don't see how she could have more than that.
YJsy is the best, she has so many of them.
Good legacy, a good legacy. Meryl Streep's daughter is a robot, she is the actress that actually plays the FBI agent in the new Grace bummer, Grace Bummer.
That's neat.  I hit the enter button by accident, but that's interesting.  That's what I was going to say.  Did you hit the Enter button by mistake?  I'm trying to prepare for Julie, and I just hit theenter button by coincidence.  It seems like that's how I hit it.  Stanly Tucci make Meryl and Julia cook together to help prepare for Julia.
I bet that food was incredible to snack on while he cooked for her character. I bet that's what she was making for the film.
Yes, they were hungry all the time smelling that and on set. I am going to have to get running now.  It was nice chatting with you, but I have to go get hungry.  LOL
Have you watched Black Panther?
I have not bought it, but I read critics' opinions on it so I know it was bought. I usually watch the first movies first because I tend to keep up with movies forever and I don't have free time. I like to read up on them before I watch, then I read Critics' opinions.
Yeah I have to watch it when I have found the time, and yeah I think it is pretty good, have you seen Black Panther? I saw it too, did you know that black panther is the richest superhero?
That's crazy, how is any superhero richer than Iron Man? I guess Thor doesn'tcount, I guess thor is the only superhero richer, he's god or a superhero, I don't know.
Bruce Wayne is worth $100 billion while Black Panther is worth more than $500 billion.  I wonder how Tony Stark is doing at work.
I never thought about Batman being worth $100 billion until now! I think the numbers make sense when you think about how much the country is actually worth. Black Panther basically has everything Black Panther is worth.
Interesting. I never thought about that either. I did know that the script in Black Panther is based on an actual ancient text, I wonder if they made it out of the actual ancient book or if they used a script in black panther
I like superhero movies that are based on source material.  It makes people think.  I think that the ancient text region feel closer to the source than other superhero movies.  That makes people in the ancient region feel much better about it.
I'm not sure. Speaking of cultural things Marvel censored, they didn't want the indian releases of Black Panther thinking it was culturally insensitive to praise Hanuman. It was the first movie to do this, so they couldn't praise Hanuma, but they couldn's praise Black Panther's thinking it would be culturally insensitive.
That reminds me of those loony toons removing speedy Gonzales the mouse from the loony Toons removing Speedy Gonzales, my favorite character. People from Mexico were really upset at that. They are upset about the people from Mexico not being able to be in the US.
I think they should do that. When a woman first appeared on TV, it was as the secretary to a member of the Supreme Justice Society. I wonder what offended them so much.
I don't think it offended anyone. I think she has some problems that might have offended someone. She lies, she lies, and she lies. She has a lasso of truth that she prevents her from being late for appointments.
Gel Gadot is a woman who is a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces and she served two years as a woman.  Things have changed a bit for the better.
Yes, it sounds like it did change a lot of things for the new Wonder Woman character, but I think the Wonder Woman in real life is a lot different than the movie.  It was successful because it was the highest-grossing superhero origin movie, so it sounds the new movie will probably change a few things.
I think its funny that Gal gadot was the one who was auditioning for Wonder Woman, she was auditioned for WonderWoman!
I had heard that, she was auditioning for Catwoman too.  I can't imagine being a superhero and not even know it.  Can you imagine being the villain and ending up perfect for the villain?
That is true, pretty cool! Wonder woman is the highest grossing WWI movie and the second highest grossed superhero origin movie, I think!
There are so many movies in the franchise that have been successful. It's probably not as successful as Marvel, but it has been as successful.
It is said that the success of Wonder Woman has taught Hollywood that boys will happily accept a female superhero.
Wonder Woman definitely paved the way for acceptance. The whole surrounding movie is good because of the effort everyone puts in. People willAccept it because the movie is about them. I realized that the superhero demographic doesn't define the film but rather the acceptance. I think that the effort is what will define the movie.
I think films need to be evaluated objectively without thinking about identity politics.
Hello, have you watched Black Panther?
I have not seen it yet. Have you?
I have not seen it yet either but I want to! Black Panther was a good movie! Did you know that Black Panther is the richest superhero?
Yeah it was, and I can imagine why, I guess there is not many super heroes more wealthy than Bruce Wayne, but I guess he is not as stark, I mean who would imagine that?
Apparently Black Panther is worth $500 billion and Bruce Wayne is worth over $100 billion but Tony Stark is worth about $100 million.
Yeah, I didn't even know they were close to that.
Cool.  The symbols and script used in the film are based on an actual script called nsibdi.
Yeah that is really cool. It is cool when you see movies that use actual facts and real history like that.
I like that too. Apparently they censored the first Indian releases thinking it would get backlash with a villainous character praising a hindu god but they had to praise hanuman instead.
Yeah, it's hard to predict how people will react to things.
Yes, did you like Wonder Woman?
I think it's cool that she's a young girls who can be cool. I think it is also a big success. I like male superheroes because it gives young girls something to cheer for and the movie was a bigsuccess.
Yeah me too. I also like that Gal gadot is a woman. She served two years as a soldier as a woman and was a soldier.
Yeah, I heard that from something I read, very impressive. I have seen the movie and it is good, but the first movie is the best I have ever seen or heard of it
She was really funny. She did Cat Woman, she thought she was auditioning for it. I thought that was really Funny
That is pretty funny, I wonder what year the original wonder women made an appearance?
I believe it was in the 1970s, but I don't know how old they were.  It's been a long time.
Yeah I guess that is a good call!  The justice society,  I think its name is the justice society?  I didn't know that,  but yeah I guess she was originally their secretary.
I think this woman has taught hollywood that boys happily accept a female superhero with or without success.
Yeah the money must be in the movie.
Movies can't really be objectively evaluated due to their cultural fluency, nuance and context. I guess Wonder Woman and black panther are successful in some aspects of their movies, but I think they need more nuance andcontext for them to be objectively reviewed.
Hey there! Sounds crazy, a lot of adults unhappy with the teenagers running for governor in Kansas.
I wonder if that is legal there?  Surely it is not.
I think so. I think they had to pass a bill in a state legislative committee in 2006 to make it a minimum age, but I think that they had not been able to pass the bill. I'm not sure why a state would need to pass an bill to do that. What do you think the minimum age should be?
That is crazy to think that people are so tired of career politicians. The high school trend started in the year 2000! People were just tired of them. Who do you think is going to win? I know that the high school Trend started in 1988 and it didn't win.
Trump has the right age and experience to do a pretty big job, but the Governor is still the head of state and a pretty BIG job, the head in the executive branch of the state, and the Governor has to govern.  I think ranking as a teenager would be helpful in the ranking and not helpful in being a president.  Trump has the experience and is the right person for that job with his age and age andExperience.
I think that's why they held their debate.  I think they are trying to get adults running for governor to be motivated.  They need adults running.
Yeah that is true, I live in Sacramento and my commute is 3 hours everyday so I have motivation for that, I used to live in CA, Arnold Schwarzenegger was Governor of California when I was there, I wish I had that motivation now, I commute 3 hours a day for 3 hours every day when Arnold Schwarzenegger is Governor,
That's much closer to me. I read that inmates can run for office, so maybe that law should be changed so that governing from state prison could be closer to us. I've read that in the US.
haha that is crazy, I think they need to look into that.  Did you know that Kentucky politicians have swear in at the same time all the time and they also have a law that says they must have participated in a duel before taking office, like Kentucky politicians had to do that, crazy
That is hilarious!  Austin tx voted to rename a garbage dump after fred durst!
Haha, Austin is so fitting! I wonder if astronauts can vote from space. I know astronauts canvote from space but they have to leave if they fill out a kind of absentee ballot. How fitting.
Good question.  I wonder if it is space mail or something else.  That's how they get it?
Did you know in the United Kingdom not all men could vote until 1918.
That's really strange. It's strange to think how much we learn about it everyday and not know.
Another strange fact is that in India, they set up a polling booth at the polls in a lion-infested forest just so that a voter could go to the polling booth.
That's very strange. Chicago is named the windy city because of the politicians who like wind versus actual wind.  I wonder why?
That's funny!  Speaking of big cities, there are no walmarts in New York City because all the local unions and politicians oppose them.  Funny how that is.  I don't think there are Walmarts anywhere else.
That's good for NYC!  I wonder why?
Agreed! I wonder if we will ever see a lottery system for selecting our politicians, like Venice did during the Middle Ages, which was a success in the success of the lottery system
that is an interesting angle. the lottery system would probably get worse.
Great talking to you!  Have a great one!
do you know much about governors?
I know a few things about them.  I know that they opposed the internment of japanese aerican during WWII.
Yes, Ralph Lawrence.  Do you know why?
Yes, Texas elected a first female governor other stated they did not ave the amendment in place for a female governor.
Wow, they were way ahead of the game in that one, I wonder what the next game will be like?
In 1934 North Dakota declared martial law and decided to secede from the US.
Wow that is something! Did you know Schwarzenegger lived there when he was cali governor?
Yeah he travelled to Sacramento every day in a private jet.
Wow, what a waste of money and bad environmental impact that would tme, what do you think?
yup pretty much, did you vote in the last election?
I did. In India they set up a voting poll for a single guy who lives in the forest with tigers.
Wow scary. Astronauts actually vote in the space too.
That is neat!  In Alabama, black males were not allowed to vote until 1918.
They have a felony law policy that prevents them from doing so.
Yeah so sad. On the other hand I think Texas is trying to get out of doing that by voting to rename the garbage dump in D.C. by voting in the garbage, and voting to renamed the garbagedump.
Hahha so funny. Did you know that not all men could vote in the US until 1918?
I think that was because of class and ranking in society. I wonder what prevented it?
Maybe. In the middle ages in Venice, officials were selected to office by the name of how well they did in office.
I believe it was a lottery. I wonder how that worked?
Yeah it sure did. James Buchanan had his boyfriend in the office called him "half of his boyfriend"
Wow. Did you know Walmart is in every city in the US?
I did not know that, is that because of local unions?
Do you like to go to Mars?
I know a lot about the Red planet, but not a whole lot about how it is like, what is Mars?
I know that it is the fourth planet from the sun, also it was named after the god of war, the god who was also the fourth sun and the god to be named after.
I read that it is called the red planet because of the reddish iron oxide on its surface.
Yeah, and the sunsets are different there because the atmosphere makes them blue.  I think the air on mars is so much better, though.
I wonder if they have any valleys.  I know that the Moon has many impact craters, valleys, deserts and ice caps of earth, but no valleys. It's interesting to see them.  They must have ice caps.
I want to live where you work so I can see it. What place do you like to live?
It would take a lot.  It would be like thin air.
I think it might be possible, but the gravity is a little lower and the atmosphere converters need to last longer. I think we will need to use another source of water in the year 2100 and the lower gravity will help with that, hopefully with atmosphere converter.
It would be lighter on mars.
I think it is because muscles would have more atrophy.
That would be problematic.  I wonder if they sound shave a higher pitch on mars than they do on earth?  I mean, do you think sound shave is at a higher pitches on earth or on mars?
I would think they would sound a bit silly on Mars.  LOL.  It would make life a little more bearable, but still not make life there.
Did you know a colony is expectd on Mars by the 2030s?
That sounds far fetched, a bit ambitious, and a huge headache to be traveling that far.  I can't see a backup or relief coming in the way.  It sounds like a huge headaches with no backup or help, sounds farfetched to me.
I know.  Can you imagine losing a satalite on Mars?  I can't even imagine losing one.
Yeah, that would be a huge mistake for the whole system, especially if it was on like 5,000 feet vs. meters.
I don't know who still does.  stubburn was able to get rid of them though, so they must be better.
Yeah, strange.  I like engineering and science.  Anyway, great chat!  Thank you for engineering and Science!
Ditto. Nice chatting with you.
You too!  Have a great day!
Thank you, you too, take care.
Hello, do you live in a state that has a governor?
No I don't. I know there is one, but I'm sure he's not on top of national news for the next election.
Well in the USA we don't live the governor is a symbol position representing the Queen, but in the UK it is a position representing The Queen.
I wonder if other political systems have different powers than ours. Governors have many different powers. Schwarzenegger has more than Schwarzenegger, I know.
He was a governor? I didn't know he was governor? That's tough. You learn so much about political stuff when you are governor. It's tough!
He commuted by private jet to Sacramento everyday and was a star, surely, so he must have commuted. He was the star of the sport, and he commuted, but I wonder if politics was a sport.
Yeah, a lot of money in the system, and yeah, the Beatles had a campaign song, "come together"  for a campaign.  I wonder what that was about?
Yes, that would be a great song!  I've watched a political fight play out in the room, and the temperature went up in the temperature in the whole room.
The ideal temperature for a room between men and women is different.  That's how debates go in the US.  We are typically dressed differently and have to be in a room around a roombetween men and Women, but not so much between men.
I think it goes deeper than that, men and women do not drive the temperature, it's all about the men
Yes.  From a masculine perspective, normal is driven by what is considered "feminine".  When feminine becomes anormal, normal becomes "anormal."
It's sexist.  Like how dry cleaners charge women $5 more for a shirt than for the clothing they use, but dry cleanerscharge women $100 more for the shirt.
That is a lot of things, haircuts, razors, and razor's
On the flip side, men are considered more of the parent than a default, but men are still the ones who own the body and the body of the women by the default.
I think it's a positive. Women are trying to put more pressure on men, but I think it is the other way around.
Gender equality is not a pressing issue for me, so I think that's why the shirt should be unisex.  Gender equality has been cut in men's style, I think, and the shirt is now a pressingIssue.
It is, it needs to start with the women. women's shirts are considered special and are not worn by men. they should stop that and stop it.
I suppose some progress has been made. I am happy to see more women in politics and I suppose some of them are doing well.
Yes I am, I think more women like Cynthia Nixon have been asked to raise the temperature in a primary debate and then they are asked to raised it further, women like her have been asking themselves, "what would Cynthia Nixon do?"
Yeah I think that should be turned into a bigger debate. With half the worlds population being women, they should turn the temperature up a little.
We have a long fight ahead. Thanks for the conversation.
Great convo, glad we agree on some things, thank you for the great convo.
Yes, we do! Bye!
I was reading about teens in Kansas putting on a movement to run for govenor to combat young voter apathy.  Amazing!  I think it is a movement.
They are big high school students.  They moved a bill recently to ban them from running.  I stopped them before they could give it a big high five.
I love the idea.  I don't care for the young people ages 18 and under but I would like to see some young people who care.  They voted in the last nonpresidential election in Kansas, and I believe it.  It was the first nonpresidentIAL election in a while.
I respect that, that is sad that those kids get mocked and laughed at all the time for not being able to vote.  I would hope that the young adults would be more willing to vote and I think that is the future of our country and the respect of many of the kids, I would hate to see those kids and young adults like them get mocked for not having the right to vote, I respect that but I would like to see more respect for them.
It is a shame.  I think they should be given kudos for organizing and for trying.  They have earned the respect of many adults for mocking other adults for Mock-a-Lago.  But I thought they were treating the election as a forum for opposing sides represented and for different opinions to have a forum to get opposing sides of the issues.  And I respect the thought of them.  Kudos to them for organizing!
Yes, they have done well!  It's funny that the mayoral election in Rio de Janeiro had a "chimp" place in the election.  The kids who were inmates were able to run as inmates and get more than 300,000 votes.  That must be funny.
Absolutely!  I have always wanted to run for something as a kid but had no idea I would be good at it.  I think getting more people involved in politics is a good idea.  The future of the country depends on thinking about the people involved.  Our country depends so much on the people.
Yes, I think so! I wish we could have teen candidates legal in every state capitol but on a positive note we need to get more teen candidates.
I agree, I wonder where this type of thinking leads us in the future, it'll be interesting to see where that type of Thinking leads us.
I think that the kids will make some positive changes eventually on every level. I think they are passionate about the issues and the government on every levels. Hopefully the kids can get into it and get passionate enough about these issues.
I was reading about voting and didn't realise that 34% of the black male population in alabama has permanently lost the right to vote.  I did not realise that.
Weird!  I know there's a governor in South Carolina that is a atheist.  I don't know if he or she is living up to the past and now we have atheists as the governor in south Carolina.  That's ridiculous!
I've never been in the south.  Sounds like lots of odd stuff to me.  In comparison to the South, I think I read that not all women in the UK had the vote until 1918, weirdly enough.  Did you know that not even women in UK could vote until 1916?
Interesting. I would love to know why. I like the brazilian proverb that the country grows at night when politicians are asleep. The country grows when the politicians areleep.
I think that's pretty cool. I heard that in Texas, they ratified a female governor when she was elected before she could vote.  I think all 50 states have at least ratified afemale governor before she was able to vote.
Awesome that is a fun fact lol!  Canada's first official money governor has cut cards in all shapes and sizes and signed them into actual playing cards,  that would be awesome!  I wonder how he or she cut the cards and signed it,  I think it's Canada'sFirst Official Money Governor fact lol
Sounds like Canada is a beautiful place, and a fun country, lol.  Hey, hey, I love that!  I wonder how many politicians in the U.S. have participated in a duel in the name of office?  I know in Kentucky there are people who took the oath of office by taking a duel with the people taking their oath ofoffice in Kentucky.  That sounds like Canada!  That would be fun to see.
That is strange. I love Canada. I do like that they are discussing the south hahahaa.
I think it was the whole duel thing.  It was the cowboy west in those days.  I like the cowboy West.
I know right,  like if I could go back in time lol  and have no laws about it.
Lots of curious things to know and fun to learn about,  its been great chatting with you,  lots of curious Things!
Have a great night!  Thanks!
do you know much about governors?
I know some stuff, I know you can't vote againts the internment of japanese american during wwii, do you know why they couldn't vote?
Ralph Lawrence!  Who was it?
Yes.  In Texas they elected a female governor, they are ahead of most other states,  we need more female governor.
Yeah and the amendement ratified in 1916
Yeah. In North Dakota the governor declared martial law in 1934
I wonder if they seceded from the US?
Yeah. Did you know Schwarzenegger used to live in Sacramento? He was the governor there once
Yeah he commuted by a private jet everyday
Yeah what a waste of a vote last time I did not vote last one
Yes, I did.  Did you know officials were elected in ancient venice by using a few of the names that officials wereelected in ancientVenice?
No, I have no idea. But I do know that astronauts vote from space. Do you know how astronauts vote?
That is cool! Did you know in venice they used to be elected by lottery?
wow cool. In the UK not all men were allowed to vote until 1918
Hmm I wonder what restrictions they had to prevent that. I wonder if there are still restrictions in place now.
No idea really. In Alabama sadly only 34% of black males were not allowed to vote in the 2012 elections.
Yeah, they lost the right in 1912 and it is a permanent ban now, so they have lost that right.
Yeahsad, things like that are not done right. In austin texas people aren't busy voting, because they are busy voting in 2020
yeah, they did vote on renaming the garbage dump fred durst.
Hhaa people have been doing that since ancient times.  Officials were elected in Venice in 1538.
I think it was by lottery and I wonder how that worked?
Have you heard of the teenagers running for governor in Kansas?
Oh yeah I have, crazy!  I can't believe that they moved forward a bill that bar people from running for office.  They should have just moved forward with a bill to bar people who were already running foroffice.
That's kind of crazy, but it is also good. I think that would inspire younger voters, and maybe help kids to show initiative.
Yeah, voting is so important, but I think it can be done. In India the government set up a polling station in a forest filled with lions for one voter, I wonder if he went in. Voting is so Important!
That is so cool, I wonder how that is possible. Astronauts can also vote from space, they can vote from Space!
ya that is awesome, and I didn't know that, I wish people in the US did that too, I wonder if people voted in Texas, like in Austin, Texas, where they voted to rename a trash dump after Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst, they have to rename the trash dump that is haha
I agree with the sentiment that Limp Bizkit is not great, but I don't agree with that sentiment that MInk Bizkism is.
Haha, amen! I will vote for them again!
That is really crazy, it makes me sad to think about it.  Did you know that 34% of the black male population in our state has permanently lost the right to vote and that makes me Sad, that 34%.  I wonder why?
That is so sad. I think it's insane that no one is ever really "in" a citizen of another state if they don't have the right to vote imo. In Texas, the first female governor has been elected before and was elected in both states. That is insane. I wonder how many states we will have women as governor soon, or maybe even a female governor.
I agree, I think it's a basic right and it's awesome for Texas to do that, we don't want to lose it.
I never knew that the Beatles' song "Do the Right Thing" was written for Timothy Leary's 1964 campaign for Governor of California.  I read that it was written as a cover of The Beatles' Song "Do You Realize?"  I never knew this.
That's a fitting song I guess. I heard speculation that James Buchanan had a boyfriend who was half of a gay president. I wonder if politicians referred to him as such. I have heard speculation That James Buchanan was the first and only gay president!
Interesting! That is good to know. I wonder if Kentucky politicians are still allowed to do that?  Kentucky politicians have to swear an oath that they have never been in office before.  I think that law should be updated.  Maybe they would be allowed to have a duel if they had to.
It definitely does need to be updated.  Chicago is a windy city.  The nickname for the city is "Windy" is because of the boastful loquacity of some of its politicians.  It's not a nickname for an actual gust of wind that shoot between buildings.  But, it is for boastful Loquacity.
Haha, I think it has something to do with local politicians and unions? I know in New York City, the walmarts are all over the place. They are the local politicians.
I cant imagine.  I live right on a corner where there's a Walmart and there is no wal-mart where I live.
I know, I live in DC and I fly to Sacramento every day by private jet.  When Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor, he would fly to sacramento every day too!
I'm surprised it wasn't a helicopter.  I think tha choppah is what he used everyday for sure.
hahahaha, that's a perfect name. In 1934 north dakota's governor declared martial law and seceded from the uk. in 1934 north Dakota's governor declaration martial law
Wow that's pretty crazy!
Hello, do you like Marvel films?
Yeah.  I love Avengers: Infinity War.  Some people refer to it as "the war of the family" which I find odd.  It's about an abusive family.
That seems kind of funny, lol! I felt that movie was great, I can't wait for the finale End Game, I felt thats going to be really good, can't believe it's only on tv right now, I think it's going to get better, I wonder if the finale end game will be better,
That will be epic! I really like Thanos played by Josh Brolin, he is a brutal character.
It will be thrilling to see him on screen again. The release of the Avengers created a notable increase in shawarma sales since its release on the screen.
Interesting. I wonder what the name of it is? Thanos is from the Greek.
Yes, that is it. Did you read the Marvel comics growing up?
I did not. Did you know that the Marvel branding began back in 1938?
Wow, that was so long ago, good thing Sony didn't buy it all, they have all the characters and all the good thing sony had in it from then on.
Yeah that is surprising, I think they only had about 50 million dollars, and yeah it would sure change things,
I hear Disney bought it a few years back, but I'm sure it's not complete yet since it's only got like 50 characters.
That is correct. You can show Big Marvel characters at theme parks east of here in Mississippi.
Interesting, I missed that one, I didn't hear of it. Did you know Stan Lee had a superhero named Blue Ear?
Stan Lee sure was cool, rest in peace.  Blue ear was created for a boy who had to wear hearing aids.  Did you know that?  I wonder how Blue Ear was created?
That is cool.  He created superheros.
It's pretty funny. Marvel successfully argued in court that mutants were not "smart" mutants and that people should not pay a lower rate on X-Men toys. It was a pretty funny case. They successfully argued that people who are smart should not have to pay the $200 rate on x-men toys
That is awesome and great marketing even lol. I liked the new Guardians of the Galaxy movies. I think they are great marketing too.
I did, Chris Pratt was one of my favorite actors, he did an incredible job of directing, and James Gunn did an excellent job of direction, James Gunn is also one of his favorite actors
Yes I agree, I watched it so many times, it was appealing to my senses in so many senses and I have never seen it, did you hear that the china version was translated into the US and watched twice?
Yeah funny.  It was the interplanetary unusual attack team.  Hilarious!
That is so accurate lol, I can see that being a rolls off the tongue lol. It was nice chatting with you enjoy your day,  and hopefully it rolls off your tongue more accurate.
The movie Avengers Infinity Wars was an interesting flick
No, I have seen it with my daughter, but I haven't seen it myself.
It is a controversial scene where the Titan, who was adopted by a brutalized daughter, is torturing her sister and has to reveal a secret to stop her.  She is forced to tell the truth about the brutalized sister and how she brutalized her daughter.
Oh ok, that sounds abusive, but it is supposed to make me interested.
He loves to recover the stone.  He sacrifices his daughter and everyone else he loves to recovered the stone, but he sacrifices his own.
Bad choice.  I didn't catch all the storyline details because I was trying to catch up on Marvel movies, but I did see that Ruffalo, Johansson, and Cumberbatch from the Marvel movies have passed away, and that Cumberbatch is one of the only actors that has not, for fear of getting the role over to Ruffalo.
I don't know. There's so many. I think there's a lot of them. I saw Guardians of the Galaxy: A Galaxy of the Infinity Galaxy, but that was only the first volume.
Yeah I haven't seen that either. I'll have to watch it again. I'm a hulk fan myself, I really like Chris Pratt. I also like Ferrigno and I think he's the Hulk fan too.
The original Hulk was great. Marvel has been around forever but I think it only started in the 2000's.
I'm told that the avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales. How in the heck did they do that?
I have no clue! It's funny because I like all the movies, I even like the voice actor for Jarvis, he's actually a voice actor of the movies!
Yeah I think I have heard that too. Did you see the Mary Poppins line?
I cant recall the name of it. Did you know Groot first appeared in the first one?
I heard that Vin Diesel plays groot in the film, and wrote a separate script for him.  He only lines up the lines he has to say in the movie, but I had no clue about voice inflection.  I wonder if they wrote a separately script.
That is funny, I can see Vin Diesel struggling with that, too!  China was even referred to as "The Interplanetary Unusual Attack Team", which was actually referred to by the US and China as an interplanetary unusual attack team.
Gotta love that!  I hear Sony was offered to do a new DC movie with all of the marvel characters for a mere $15 million and they balked.  epic fail.  I wonder why they balking at using marvel characters.
Absolutely!  I have never thought that Spiderman was a superhero until I met a geek who didn't care for him.  He thought that spiderman wasn't a superhero!
Sony has a studio with questionable ideas, but they do have a park in Mississippi.  Disney has parks east and west of the Mississippi/Orlando line in FL and DC has a park east of the Florida line.  Marvel has been using Marvel characters for theme parks and Disney has a new studio withquestionable ideas.  I saw the Marvel characters at a comic con.
Wow that is pretty nuts! Disney World is a huge park, and Marvel has a character named Access, I think its funny because it is from both companies universes, Disney World has a huge character named access, and marvel has a whole huge park with a character called Access!
That's a sad reason to exist.  Avengers Infinity War is a spectacular show.  I think I will go watch it unfold again in Imax digital cameras soon.  The first Avengers movie was a spectacular one, and the second movie is going to be even better, I am sure, with all the new Imax Digital cameras and everything that goes into it.  It is going for a spectacular Show!
I can relate to the good folks in general, did you know that in the 70s a 5 year old wore hearing aids and was a superhero? I can't see how you make a superhero out of something like that, I wonder if they could make a superhero out of good folks
Nice!  I enjoyed chatting.
Hi, do you like the Marvel comic universe?
I love the whole DC Universe that Marvel movies offer. I think that they have so many possibilities with the super heroes and so many people wanting to be super heroes.  What is your fav Marvel movie?
I liked Guardians of the Galaxy, Galacy and Black Panther. How about you?
It was hard to choose, I liked guardians of the galaxy but love Scarlette Hanson in avengers: avengers of the groot, so hard to choosing.
I have no idea who she is, but I do like that Groot goes back to the 60s, so he has an idea. What do you think?
I didnt know that,  I didnt even know the guardians were going to be guardians of the pack lol,  interesting how James gunn really wanted Chris Pratt to be in it,  and he found someone that was better.  I dont balme it, I dont like Chris Pratt,  but I think its interesting howJames gunn did that, I mean he really wanted CHRIS pratt in it and he didnt balme with the pack,  thats what i found out.
I wonder if they used the cgi in real life or just the movie. I cant recall if it was just the poppins line.
Haha I'm sure it was libbed or maybe ad libbed, who knows? I do know that the line is probably my fav character from the movie.
I like the Chris Pratt character interaction with the racoons, he makes me laugh.  What about you?
So true.  I love their interaction!  I am a movie aficionado, so there is alot to know.  Mark Ruffalo was awesome!  Zoe Saldana is also great,  and I think all the actors were great!   I couldnt pick a better actor,  but I love them all alot.  Are you a movie fan or a actor?  I just love their interactions.
I wonder what china and the taiwan call the movie?  I know that they call the Movie "One".  I wonder what China would call it.
I do not know that, what do they call it?
Interplanetary Unusal Attack team.  Roll of the tounge,  the rolls of the unusal,  interplanetary unusal attack team.
Yea, I know lol, I can't beleive it when it rolls off haha. I can start to wonder how Marvel corp and DC corp got their start, lol
Yeah, that is so long!
 apparantly, the evolution of the Marvel branding began in the early 1960s. Marvel comics have generally become Atlas Comics since the early 1980s.
I think it's crazy that they were able to access all of that access, but marvel was so inventive with the shared hero's. They didn't have to seperate them. I read where marvel used to have a seperate name.
I think that as an outsider its cool that they are trying to be successful.  It's a challenge and I hope they are both successful. I think that the point of growth and reaching success is to be fought for by the outsider.
Agreed. I feel bad for them. I enjoy both sides, but I can't choose a side. So I just enjoy both and don't have to choose a Side.
I am happy to be in the middle of it and choose not to choose.  Fun fact...Vin Diesel played Groot in the movies but had no idea he was going to be the one to play him, he had no clue.  I like that fun fact!  I wonder why they did that?
I had no idea either, nice chatting with you!
Hi!  Do you like superheroes?
I am great, I love superheroes. I watched Avengers: Infinity War and I think I will go watch Avengers: Age of Ultron right now, how about you?
No I have not. I dont watch superhero films. I like Spider-man, but I think it is more like the story than the special effects.  I dont think I will watch it again.
That was a good movie, I liked it too. Avengers: Infinity war is the first film shot entirely with digital imax cameras, and it's the first movie to do so.
That is great, I think the technical innovation will make the theater experience much better,
Did you know the avengers movies caused a increase in shawarma sales lol.
lol, funny,  I saw that on TV with some kids after the movie and decided they wanted to eat it,  they saw the movie too and decided it is what they wanted.  lol
LOL, I guess it made it to the movies and was not mentioned.
Makes sense!  So who is your favorite marvel hero?
Hmmm I guess I like Ant Man and Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy. Thor, Thor, and Ant Man
I heard Guardians was pretty funny, I dont really like the other films I have seen of Spider-man, but I heard Guardians of the Galaxy was good.
Yeah, it was hilarious. Spiderman is cool too.
It's funny that they're doing a sequel to Guardians too. that should be funny too, I wonder what it's going to be about.
No it is not that good,  it was more of an interplanetary unusual attack team.  lol  doesnt that just roll off the tongue of the tongue and then when they went to taiwan and china they renamed it to tailand and ch China they renamed themselves as the interplanets unusual attackteam.  LOL
It is a catchy name lol, I surely remember it now.  Imuat!  I wonder if it is any good.  I surely don't remember seeing the first one, but I surely remembers the second one.
It is hard to believe it came about so soon lol.
I dont think I would be able to check out the film in English. I dont know if it would be appropriate with all the jokes and plot, combat and special effects.
Yeah, I don't like the one in the US either. It does feel unrealistic.
It can get a bit boring the older you get, especially with computer graphics. Anyway, great chat!
It was great chatting with you too, thanks for all the info.
Thanks!  Have a good night!
You too!  Thank you!
Do you like rock music?
I do, I like it a lot, I especially like Jazz music, do you like Jazz?
I do like to listen to it sometimes!  lol  Viktor Tsoi was the biggest rock star in Russian history!  He got a job in a boiler room in the apartment of the biggest Rock star to ever have a job!  LOL
Wow!  That's pretty good dedication to work.  I've heard that some restaurants use loud rock or rock type music to make it seem like the patrons are more likely to choose rock over salads, in theory.
That is pretty interesting!  I didn't realize that!  That would explain why I didn's why I never realize that.  For some reason I think the state rock song of Oklahoma is "F flaming lips."  I wonder if that's the one.  lol
Wow, that is an interesting pick of songs, I can't imagine what that rock song would have been like. I play both rock and jazz so I have to imagine that's a really interesting pick.  I play in a coffee houses that play both ROCK and Jazz.  It is nice being in a modern, modern, coffee house that plays both.
I have been to a lot of wineries, but not coffee shops. I have been at live rock and jazz bands at a lot, too. I relate to the live rock at the wineries and the live jazz at the coffee shops, too! I've never been to one of the coffee shop/boutique ones. I was a fan of Whitesnake, but I don't know jazz bands.
I have heard their stuff but not a huge fan, too bad. I guess I am more into Led Zeppelin.
Lol, well, Led Zeppelin has a history. I like Whitesnake, too. It was nice that they had a reunion of some members of the late 80s.
Wow that's a lot of members, it's hard to keep track of that many hands, I guess they had a lawsuit against them for using too many hands. Mario Batali always played the piano, he's good in restaurants but I guess he didn't know rock music was a fan.
wow.  A Hanson song became the most requested track on a Chicago alt-rock radio station because the DJs didn't reveal the name of the band.  lol  I wonder if that was the Hanson song or the band's name.  Maybe the DJs just didn't want to reveal the names of the bands.
lol, sorry, I meant to say "music festival"  LOL.  That is funny about Hanson.  They almost had a lawsuit over that.  Another funny about hanson is that the salad restaurant chain, sweetgreen, had a sue them over a lawsuit because hanson had eaten too much at their music festival.  I like sweetgreen.
I heard about that place, I have heard of it but I don't know the details on the name of the place.  lol
Fresh Choice restaurants have all sorts of different names for it. It's sort of a scary one. People that work there say they play rock music so loud that some of the people work there have to go to the ER because it's a hazard because other places play rock and it's too loud for the people that work at the restaurants.
Interesting.  I did not know that.  Led Zeppelin's song "Black Dog" is named after a black dog that was wandering around the recording studio, not a real relation to the black dog.  He was actually a black lab.  They named it after the recording Studio.
It's funny how places are correlating loud rock music to eating pretty much anything.  I think people want to eat junk food at restaurants and then rock music.  Funny how places have gotten so loud and now people are eating pretty well known junk food.  lol
Lol Led Zeppelin let Ben Affleck use his record player to record "Levee breaks" digitally for Argo with condition they let him alter it digitally.  I don't think that would be possible with an MP3 player though, right?
That is very creative of them! Led Zeppelin is the school of rock music, the "immigrant song." Jack Black has his fans backing him and is creative in many ways.
That's cool. I didn't know that.  Jazz trumpeters grew goatees because it provided comfort when playing.  Hmmm... I wonder if that's in the movie?  I saw a movie about it.  It's been fun chatting!
wow that is pretty funny.  I played the trombone in my jazz band and one of my bandmates had a quirk where he said bad jokes about himself and played theTrombone.  LOL Cya,  bad jokes,  lol
lol nice!  I wonder if he was any good.
Hello -  do you like to go to the restaurant much?  I hear that even music can influence your food choices when you go to a restaurant.
I heard that too,  I think it's funny that some people think it is funny that they eat bad foods lol,  but I guess louder music amps up your senses,  and people are more likely to eat bad Foods lol
I need to start either wearing ear plugs or eating away from music. lol.  lol  I think I'll start going to eating places that don't have music.  I can do better.
hahahaa, hahahaa, I guess restaurant owners want the people to order more food, but they haven't done that in a long time.
Yeah, and that includes desserts as well. The music helps create a vibe.
I read that they play rock music too.  Led Zeppelin.  I think that is why customers like to order a lot of the burgers,  they play Led Zeppelins when they have beers lol.  They say the burgers have cheese or the fries and the beers have beer.  So I order a little of both.
I've ordered some of those side salads with a bacon jam and a music louder than the music louder.  I like it.  They are the best!
Hhaha, interesting. I guess it's good that it's so good to have jazz music on because people tend to have much easier choices when they want to order their food and they are making a decision on whether or not the music will play or not, but I guess if you start listening to Jazz music, it's easier to make better choices hahaaa, maybe they should start listening more to Jazz instead of music?
I think its real,  Ill make better food choices then,  I think its the best trick while shopping,  its the only way to do it,  go to the store and use it, Ill make much better food decisions for real.
I think I might try that too! I have been going to supermarkets lately. I think music, upbeat or ambient, makes a difference. I like music.
It is crazy that a place with loud live music will ask you to leave, if you are in a place to drink or get a drink, if the music is made too loud.  It seems like it works well to leave a place that is made for live music but not a placeWith loud liveMusic.
I guess I would like to go to a place that is loud but not too loud because I could have a few drinks and listen to a live band.  I would probably amp up the amps and have a little more drinks and watch.  Interesting.
Did you know that Led Zappelin helped to fund Monty Python and the holy grail?
That is so cool!  I love Monty Python and Led Zeppelin.
Yes me too, I like Pink Floyd and Genesis.
Those are great bands!  I wonder if they named it after the Led Zeppelin song Black Dog, named after their lab that was running around the studio.  LOL  The Led Zeppelins song Black dog was actually named after the studio!
That is crazy, wow, what a band.
lol I guess it worked out for them lol I guess, I agree, it was great! It is crazy though, I like older rock bands better, like the band Whitesnake, wow what a crazy name, all the band's members names were from the same band, I wonder if that is still going on, they are a great band,
Wow! Sonic the hedgehog was supposed to be a member of a rock band initially, and not a rock one.
I did not, I did not know Sonic was supposed to have a blond haired girlfriend named Madonna? haha.
Great chat!  Have a good night!
I think it's interesting how loud music can have such an influence on our choices.
Wow! I had no idea!
Yeah apparently you can order a burger and a salad at a place with loud music but not at a Place with loudMusic, and you can't order a salad
I need to start listening to softer music, not just to get my belly going, but to the burgers!
lol, I agree with you. I think its amazing how music influence simple decisions, it has a deep power, it can lift the sales in the store, lol, I can't believe how music can have so much deep power
I rely on music more at the gym, especially when lifting or doing any cardio.  I like to listen to podcasts or something upbeat and loud while I'm lifting.
I love rock music, what genre do you like?
I like classic rock, classic rock and dirty rock. Throw in rap and alt rock and altrock for a while.
Do you know the rockband the whitesnakes?
No, I do not.  How about you?
Aparently the band has a Wikipedia page, but the list needed to have over 250 members and they are not on the list! I wonder who they are on the Wikipedia page.
That is funny.  They have a state rock song with a name like "Flames Lips"  It is a state ROCK song!
Did you know that the band Led Zeppelin used to be known as the band Zeppelin?
I sure do. What about you?
I do like them, the song black dog is named after a labrador that happened to be in the studio with the band, interesting facts about the time and date, the band's song Black dog is also named after that labrador, it was a studio in the time of the song, its the only one I know of that had a lab Labrador that happened during the time.
Did you know Sonic the hedgehog was supposed to be a member of the band? I think he was going to be and his girlfriend was a member.
His girlfriend was named Madonna! lucky dog lol, I guess he was pretty good at that, he was the best dog lol.
Do you like jazz? Do you know much about it?
I don't know, but I know jazz is a genre that does influence a lot of people.  There is a programming language that is influenced by jazz, and I think that's why it is the only programming language to have it.
I love jazz. I think it's America's classical music.
I love it too. Jazz trumpeters actually grow goatees for the comfort they bring.
Hi!  It is interesting that people tend to order a better burger at a noisier restaurant, it is so good.  I like that people seem to order more and it is interesting to me, but it is a noisyier restaurant.
Yeah, the loud noise makes them anxious and greasy food is comforting. The atmosphere of the restaurant is also what causes it. The owners must be concerned about creating a "club" atmosphere. I think loud noise and greASY food iscomforting for them.
Maybe they should hire a band to do the extra meat for them.
Haha, I know.  That would not surprise me at all.  I know the Lucky Buns restaurant in Washington DC has a burger with a lettuce option that is a top seller.  They have it at the Lucky Breads restaurant in DC.  No lettuce option at all!
That place actually sounds pretty good. Kids screaming must blend in with it.
Yeah, I find that it can be a bit distracting for the kids.  It's not a good place to be played loud rock music.  Too bad the US version of the classic "Let It Go" is bad for the children.
Yea, I think they should play some Led Zeppelin then.
It is funny that Hanson's song "Come Together" became the most requested track on a Chicago alt-rock station because they didn't reveal the band.
That is funny and also awful.  Whitesnake has apparently had so many different members over the years that the band has had over 50 members over 50 years.
That's pretty good! Hard to believe it was that popular. I'm not a huge fan but I do like good jazz. Apparently the trumpet is really popular in New Orleans so it's not hard to get some pretty good jazz players. Did you know trumpet players used to grow a goatee for comfort when playing?
Interesting. Clint Eastwood is an enthusiast too.
I had no idea!  I wonder if he likes jazz.  Jazz is so popular in Pakistan, a jazz orchestra is topping the charts.  It's not popular in the US, but it is popular there.
apparnetly jack black made a video where he had fans begging him to sing the immigrant song, he made aVideo.
I heard that song.  It is pretty funny.  Did you know that Sonic the hedgehog was supposed to be the name of a member of the band Tenacious D and was supposed be a member with a blond haired girl named Madonna on 3rd Rock from the Sun.
I wonder if Sonic would play it well.
I was thinking maybe an electric guitar or drums, but who knows!  Led Zeppelin is one of the biggest rock bands and best selling artists in history, and I think music of all artists inISTORY.
Yes, they helped fund the monty python and thy holy grail movie.
I wonder if that has an impact on the shows, they were initially unpopular with critics and now look at the shows and their impact
That is absolutely hilarious. I can see it.
The conversation makes me want to go to a restaurant with Led Zeppelin and order a big cheeseburger.
I would too! What would you do?
Have you ever read the Harry Potter books or seen any of the movies?
I have seen the movies, a couple of them I think.
Yeah, it's set in WW2. the guy who plays Malfoy wants to steal the Wand!
Sounds like he is staying in character and doing a malfoy like thing.
Hahah, true!  I wonder if he was caught.  Too bad he got caught.
Spielberg wanted to make Harry Potter as an animated movie, which seems like an odd choice, since animation is usually for animation.
Yeah, I heard that.  I don't know much about animations.  They should've used that to reward Daniel for winning the role of Harry.
No, I don't. Wasn't it for the job?
He was allowed to stay and go watch Fawlty Towers and also watch Fawlty Tower 2
Did you know that Terry Gilliam was Rowling's first choice to direct the new movie, Fawlty Towers?  I didn't know that the Monty Python guy and Monty python alum was going to direct a new film, but Terry Gilligan wasRowling's first Choice to direct?  How can that be, he did so well with The Last Movie!
I wonder if there was an unauthorized sequel in china with Hobbit characters with Harry Potter characters.
I wonder how that came about.  I wonder if Monty Python and the monty python had anything to do with it, or if it was just an unauthorized Chinese Stephen Fry doing the narration for the "Days Like These" in China.  Did you ever see that narration?
Yeah, ha-ha, maybe, Johnny Depp did, I don't know.
I do, but we parted ways because he did not have the same artistic vision for the movie and I parted ways with him.
I think he directed the film, Brave. I think it is well done.
I didn't either.  Did you know the first film that a native person was in was a film?
Yes, it is working on it.  Dr. Seuss will be in the movie as well.
I hope he does a good job on it.  He is not known for biopics though so I hope he will do well on that one.
Yeah, me too. Have you ever seen Edward Scissorhands?
I have. It is an odd tale of what an odd story it is. I saw it a few years ago. I thought the casting was perfect.
Pretty odd. Apparently Depp did not say a word in the entire film. He didn't even appear in the film.
I always suspected that he was paid very little for every word he said.  I wonder why he demands that the other stars have to keep saying the same word.  He is only getting paid what he demands.
Yup! Nice chatting with you!
Are you a fan of Johnny Depp?
Yeah I like many of the roles he played, Tim Burton and him are a good combination for instance they are both teams, and they are on teams for sure, what about you?
I like him in that too. I thought it was ok, he did well in 13 Jump Street.
Wow, I haven't seen that series in awhile. I thought it was waaaay back in the 90s. I actually thought they put out the sleepy hollow after hearing about this one eyed horse that they adopted from the sleepy Hollow after hearing that they were going to put down the one eyed horses. Lol. That would be awesome!
Yes it was. Richard Greico replaced him.
Greico was in the show for awhile, but he replaced Depp and then Booker.  I dunno if it was on the series for very long or not, my memory all fuzzy.. booker was on it for a bit, Greico maybe?
Yeah, Johnny Depp was hilarious in that. I forgot he only had like 300 words in Edwards scissorhands. I think I only had about 200 words. I wonder if Johnny Deppel had more? I know he forgot over 300 words.
I can't recall his character being a talkactive fellow. Speaking of Depp, I heard he's working on a new film. I heard it's a Dr. Seuss biopic and he's going to be playing Dr. Siegel in the film. That would be interesting to watch. I can't seem to recall hisCharacter at all.
Hmmm, sounds interesting. I wonder if it will be a fantasy or a different genre? I like fantasy!
I did a little bit back in the day. I knew of some local groups that would open up a people's fantasy game where you could play. I was told there is also a draft of a national spelling bee, open to everyone. I never knew that, but they draft people in the local and national spelling Bee. Wonder how that works?
I don't know how that works? pick a bunch of kids and let them win? I wonder what happens if they don't.
That's how they work. I was told there is a fantasy congress, but I've never seen it.
That sounds like it would be boring to me lol,  sounds like something boring to do lol
I wonder if there is a real fantasy congress in our country. They waste huge amounts of tax payer money. I wonder if they have a fantasy congress?
yup, I wonder if that will ever happen. Did you know a single fold in the brain makes the difference between fantasy and reality?
That is pretty neat.  I wonder why people are more into fantasy if there is one fold missing?
I like some of the shows that they watch. I lose interest in them after a long while, but I still watch some of them.
Speaking of long, there was a janitor that wrote a 15,145 page fantasy manuscript called "Unreal" that was a fascinating story. I have to go on YouTube to see if it is still on there. It's about a janitors manuscript of a 15-year-old fantasy manuscript Called "Farmer in the Realms"
Interesting, some people do it just to get away with it. Nice chatting with you!
I think its kind of popular among artist because it is published in different parts, parts of it are not published, but I gather that is the thing that is most popular among them. Good talkign with you as well.
You too!  Take it easy!
Hi, have you seen the fantastic beasts movies?
I do.  I saw the newest one.  What about you?
I have seen both! Fantastic Beasts‘ sequel goes surprisingly dark at the end with a shocking reveal.
I guess I can see that. I feel like some Harry Potter movies have gone from pretty light and tame to pretty dark, like the Harry Potter movie. My son is going to be rewatching them all right now so I guess I'll have to keep it pretty light, or pretty dark.
I think it is cool how the film opens with the title character, the evil wizard played by Johnny Depp, escaping from detention, and the film follows him as the film opening film opens, the film is about the title's character, and how he was escaping from Detention.
We are dragging our feet, but we don't have to worry about him. Speaking of movies, Jason Isaacs, who played lucius malfoy in the harry potter films, says that in the first film he caught a little wand from the set. I wonder if he tried to steal it?
I loved the first two.  I think he is doing well in Star Trek 3.  He did well for himself as a reward for winning the best part of Harry Potter.  Daniel radcliffe, who played daniel radcliffe in the first 2, was only allowed to stay and watch the last two because he was a part of the reward.  Winning a part in harry potter was a reward!  Did you see the fawlty towers?
Did you know that Daniel radcliffe was allowed to stay up and watch fawlty towers as a reward for winning the part of harry potter? I wonder why he would want to stay as a rewards reward for win the part.
I always wanted to go watch it but I didn't want to end up like him and have to watch it all, the production took place over ten years and did not end until 2013.
I never knew that.  I wonder why they changed the names of the characters, like Hobbit, etc.  In 2007 an unauthorized harry potter sequel was sold in china consisting of only the Harry potter characters.
I think I heard about that back in the 70s, the main character was a troll, but I'm sure there is a troll out there named Harry Potter, or at least he has been around a while.
That is crazy.  I didn't know that.
Johnny Depp was in all the knockoffs of it.  He won the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards.
I wonder if he's done anything in the Harry Potter universe.  Did you know that Hogwarts is located in Scotland but it says England on the Harry potter universe.
I didn't know that either, it is also the highest-grossing film series with over $8.5 billion in worldwide receipts.
Johnny Depp directed it.  I like Brave, the first film.
I wonder if he took the leap after Depp rose to prominence on the television series "Jump Street"
Weitd!  Johnny Depp is producing and possibly starring in a biopic on the life of Theodor Geisel, aka Dr. Seuss.  Hih.  I know, right?  Johnny depp is produced and possibly starred in a biography of the Life of Theodore Geisel.
Johnny Depp has said some of the best dialogue in his past films, like those last two words in Edward Scissorhands, which is "I don't want to go to the movies."
That is crazy! I am very disappointed in Johnny Depp. I was disappointed in the remake of Willy Wonka that he did. Gene Wilder refused to watch it. I am sure he was disappointed that Gene Wilders refused to be in the UK remake of willy wonka.
Cool!  I didn't like either Depp or Wilder, so I can see that.  comedic fantasy author Terry Pratchett was knighted in 2010, for his services to literature.  I wonder what the honor was for?  comedic Fantasy author Terry pratchett is the only knighted one ever?
People fantasy draft the national spelling bee like a drinking game.  I wonder how many of them have turned it into a drinking GAME.  People fantasy draft everything.
I wonder if it's any good. There was a janitor from Chicago who wrote a 300-page fantasy manuscript in two years.
Hi! Do you like the Harry Potter series? I did not do well in my impression of it.
I think its great for kids and adults it is really exciting, great for all!
It is very exciting, but the series does seem like a great amount of work, I do not think it is a great lot of work.
It's incredible that the series' eight films are the highest-grossing films of all time.
True, it is very interesting to note that they are the highest-grossing film series ever with over $8.5 billion in worldwide receipts.
Wow that is so much!  The boy that played Malfoy was caught trying to steal the wand on the set once!
Wow, that's not really professionalism at all.  I wonder why they brought him back?  Actions, actions, actions.
I'm not sure.  I don't think so, but I do know that Rowling didn't have a car when writing these books and in the beginning, she lived in a car during production.  She was the first author to have a movie in production, and she has been in movies before.
Yeah I think I heard of similar stories of how individual struggles and how they hit the big league, but never heard of her doing that!
I like movies like that.  My favorite movie to star is Tyler Perry who plays Madea in the Harry Potter series.  Love that one.  Did you ever see it?
Interesting. I did not know Tyler Perry played in Harry Potter movies.
I know there is confusion because of all the movies, but he is homeless living in a car when he started writing for the movies. I don't even know how he got that name.
Johnny Depp is an actor too.
He is really talented and very versatile.  He can play so many different types of characters and is very talented.
I agree, he is a talented individual. The pirates of the Caribbean series also made a significant amount of money, and I know pirates of a Caribbean series is a really talented individual too.
I think that the whole Caribbean movie series is going to make a sizable amount of money. I think he should have a movie he filmed in that country with all the Chocolate in it, it would be better than the last movie he did with the pirates and the chocolate.
Wow!  I saw some parts of that movie.
Leonardo De Caprio is one of the best.  I don't remember the movie, but he played a guy who was eating Gilbert Grape.  Do you remember the name of it?
I do not remember that one.  Is that the movie?
It was a good movie. I miss it, but it was a really good movie, so I will miss it too lol.
I don't know what movies have a fantasy theme, but they make a lot of money in the box office.  Do you know why?  Do they have a lot in the fantasy theme and that is why they make such a lot  of money at the box Office?
I don't personally like fantasy themed movie or books, but I know that some do.
I like some of them, I think the genre has come a long way, it takes a good story line to get me to like the genre
Good point! fantasy author terry pratchett is really special. he was knighted for his services to literature and was knighting in 1981.
That is true!  I didn't know that!
Jurassic World has been a criticism, with some saying it's departure is a departure from the original Jurassic Park, but others say it's a message better than the original. What do you think?
I like the original, but I think it is a departure from the message of the original.
Apparently Jurassic World abandons the "one way" of the original where human attempts to be controlled by the nature have unintended consequences.  In the original, it was about being controlled.  Apparently Jurassic World Abandons that, because of nature's "unforeseen consequences".
That's not a good idea.  There is a movie about dinosaurs that is only 15 minutes long that is a good example of that.
Agreed. I would like to see an updated version of Jurassic Park with feathered dinosaurs. It would be amazing. What would be even more amazing would be an updated Jurassic Park where a giant enraged fighting cock cock T. rex would be the only dinosaur.
Dillon Connolly and Colin Trevorrow are writing and Steven Spielberg is executive producing it, I highly doubt your dream will come to fruition, but I like what Derek Connolly is writing and Steve Spielberg is doing.
Yeah, that whole feathered dinosaur thing turns a lot of people off.  I think I would rather see westworld.  Maybe Westworld will be better than that feathered dinosaurs thing.
I have seen it for the first time and I think it's a pretty good Evan Rachel Wood who plays Dolores on the show is fantastic, she's really good
I'll have to check it out.  There was a West World movie with Yul Bryner as well as a kid that I vaguely recall.  I think it was the West World Movie, or was it the Westworld 2?  I vaguely remember seeing that one.
I wonder if the theme is sort of the same for humankind?  Technology has used the wisdom of the past for destructive purposes.  It is used for technology, but not wisdom.
Yeah, that is a departure from the first one. Apparently Jurassic World is a little different as well.
I would watch it if it sticks with Michael Crichton's message of "Don't prey on the good side of technology, and focus on the potentially bad" from his source books.  If you watch it, you'll get the Michael Cranchton message and the focus on his side of the technology and not the bad side of his source source books, it's probably better.
Yeah, I will check those out.  I like the prey scenario, but I like that "next" is more about the actual event of the event rather than the things we can do.  There was a similar event involving genetically engineered rootbeer bacteria that eventually spread and destroyed all plant life on earth.  Maybe that was the next one to check out.
I've seen some of these shows and I didn't know about that. I thought it was hot the raptor suits in the Jurassic Park were all computer generated. I don't think I've seen Jurassic Park.
Yeah, I'm amazed that there is no idea how big they are. I always assumed they were CGI and had no idea, I was amazed.
It's hilarious that the raptors on the Jurassic Park ride are robotic.  I think that would be a pretty fun experience since they cost $15 to make and it would only cost $300 for the movie to make.  The raptors in the Jurassic park ride are robots.
As a kid I love that ride!
T-Rex on the other hand?  Apparently, it took the computers 4 hours to render one frame back in the 70s.  That movie was CGI.  Computers have come a long way since then, but I think it took hours toRender one frame of "The T-Rex" on hand.
They sure have, I can remember how realistic it looked when I watched the movie, I still remember how realism it looked!
That was a good movie, I'm a fan of the first one, but not a fan as long as Chris Pratt was in it, but it was a really good movie.
Are you familiar with this?
Wow! The creator of tetris did not get royalties from the game, it is unfortunate for him
Yeah I know, some people don't get enough money for creating tetris. That's why it's a game so famous. I heard that the game's creator, Alexey Pajitnov, is one of the best gamers, so I wonder why he didn't get money forCreating tetris, people are just gamers.
Yeah I think tetris was invented way back in the 1960s, but it still is super popular today. It's one of the highest selling games of all time.
Yeah, I recently heard there were about a bazillion versions of it on game consoles and there is a version called Tetris effect, I think.
I bet it is addictive more than the original. I used to have the game on Playstation 2.
Yeah, I heard that. I'm told VR games and stuff are really good, but I thought I would go that route. I heard tetris is really good. I think it will be good, and I told Vr games I'm curious to try. Maybe they will add it to movies.
It amplifies the experience of the game and also adds a more imersive feel to the game, it is medatative and very imersive, it adds to the experience.
Sounds interesting, it does magnify the Tetris effect of helping people with PTSD, I wonder how they will magnify The Tetris Effect of helping everyone.
I wonder if it would be proven scientifically to aid the recovery of people dealing with trauma. I think that ptsd sufferers would benefit, I think it would have been proven scientifically.
Yes, that's why I like the zone mode they put into Tetris. It adds a cool new mechanic to a classic game and helps with the Tetris effect. I like fixing it after it's broke, but it's still a classic. That zone mode I like about it. It's like fixing something that already broke, and then fixing it again.
I think the zone mechanic is ok, but I prefer to classic version.  Gaming is a little old school, and the zone mechanics are something I prefer.
Yeah.  I think there's some warm fuzzy nostalgia there.  When I was a kid, I used to pass time by playing Tetris on my GameBoy, NES, and GameBoy Advance at home.  Now, I have a Playstation 4 and I feel a little bit of a bit of that warm fuzzy memory of playing Tetristis when I was at home, but I don't have that warm warm fuzzy nostalgia.
Heck, it's a really popular system, with 250 million units sold.  It's the most popular system of all time.
Sadly it broke down and I fell into the games that I used to play on it.  Hahaha.  I have a computer now and use it to play some of the games.  The US department of defense even made a super old computer that was only used for entertainment centre to save money.  They made it to save on the electricity bills and save money, hahaha
Wow, I didn't know that! I had a PS2 too. I also have the newer ps Vita, PS3 and PS Vita, and Playstation Portable. Have you ever used a PlayStation Portable?
Yeah, I hear the Vita's pretty good, but I don't know if it can rival the Nintendo 64.  I wonder how much the Playstation products sold for, since they sell for so much. I think there are more PlayStation products sold now, but it's not like Nintendo has been around that long.
Yeah, they sold over 300 million of them in a day alone, and over 1 million in just the first year alone, that was in 2003.
wow, that is pretty impressive. they are using playstations to also research black holes.
Yes, and they use the slogan "Greatest Desirees" in the commercials too. I guess it really does mean greatness awaits!
I guess greatness awaited tetris on playstation 2, that was a great game, mabye its the second greatest game, great game ever
I wonder if black hole research is more productive than playing grand theft auto.  Or maybe it is moreproductive than playing Grand Theft Auto.
Mabye you could. I like the original, but the newer Grand Theft Auto games have a soundtrack that is only on disc from the original one, but not the new ones.
I doubt it.  I didn't realize they had that.  People don't have PS1 players anymore.  They probably just don't realize it.
I have a DVD or Blu-ray player that can play CDs but I'm just sticking with a DVD for now.
That's good. I think I might try the discs from the Playstation store. I like the old games and some of the old discs from before the Playstation 1.
Yeah, it is so convenient but also a hassle with always changing discs.  Hahaha.  I have a PS4 player and it's funny that the Playstation store has a PS3 player,  I don't know how convenient that is.
The CD player is a versitle machine of a government super computer.
Yeah it is impressive.  It is strange that fifa is only in the US though.
I can't imagine why the graphics were so different for those versions.
Yeah, I'm not sure about the features of the game, but the versions all had different graphics and different features. It confused the heck outta me. I think it would have confused me too.
I know, right?  I can't imagine how those games would look with different features.
Yeah I think so.  You'd probably find that you had to buy the different versions of the feature you wanted, and if you bought the wrong one, it would be annoying to buy one and then buy the game with the feature of the other versions, you would find yourself with the same feature you bought.
Technology is getting bigger.  It was just a matter of time before a version of it was released for a bigger, better version of the PS4.
Yeah!  I wonder what they will put in the next one.  Maybe some kind of tetris?  Mabye holodeck tetris or a new kind of Tetris? haha
Maybe it's in the chip they put in your brain?
Yeah, I think they put an unlock code into your brain. It's amazing how much we know about our brain.
They did, it was a massive data breach, and now the owners banks accounts are wiped out if their owners banks account are wiped away
Do you watch the latests Jurassic Park movie or tv movies?
I didn't, do you?  Who is the main actor in it?
Chris Patt, both great actors, the movie is actually cost $15 million, and cost only $50 million, I really liked the movie, it was ok
Chris Patt?  Who is Chris Patt? Is he in the latest Jurassic Park?
Yes that is the leading actor in fact he is the best leading actor, a great sequel to the first one, it only has dinosaurs in it for only about 15 minutes, its a great sequels,
I didn't know that about the dinosaurs.
Yeah,  yeah i liked that movie,  I didnt like it the intesting fact about how raptors were generated,  that was made by computers,  they are made by computer and I didnt even know about that,
I saw Jurassic 3, it was directed by Spielberg, and it was really good. I liked it more that Jurassic Park.
I don't know about it, I know he is familieared with hiw work and has the talent for it. I think Bayona will be directed by someone else, he is not known for his talent. I am guessing theres a movie in the movie though.
I think Spielberg was also involved in it, so he must be good, I think.
I agree Spielberg is a great director, he took 4 hours to render a part of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park, sounds expensive, I agree Spielberg was a great Director, it took him 24 hours to Render the TRex in Jurassic Park
That does sound expensive. I wonder how much it would cost to watch the Fallen Kingdom?
That would be a good movie, you wont regret watching it, its a good one,
Is Pratt a good actor?
He is a good actor, yeah he is one of the leading actors of Guardians of the Galaxy, I think he is also one of The Leading actors of guardians of the galaxy
Do you live in a van in Hawaii? I don't, and I don's that's where I live.
Hard to believe he got a lucky break. I bet he was the waiter at the Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant that he was scouted at. He got his lucky break when he was a waiter at that restaurant and not at the bubba gump shrimp restaurant that they scouted him at.
That is lucky, he was lucky, there are a lot of good talents out there,
I agree. He joked that he didn't want to do the lead role on Jurassica Park. I guess his joke was a reality, but in reality, he did get the lead position.
I read his comment and it was Spielberg.
Yes, he did. He stole the costume for the role on guardians of the children and went to visit sick children at hospitals and it was galazy. It was a movie about the role and his role on guardian of the sick and his visit. I like that movie.
Nice chatting with you.  Thanks.  Nice chatting with ya.
Hello!  How are you?
I'm alright, how are you?
I am great! How are you, do you like the NBA? I have been watching some Golden State basketball lately.
I do like it! I'm better at tabletop games and video games than sports. I'm not good at Tetris though.
Nice!  I used to play tetris all the time.  I was terrible at it.  It felt like it was so hard to get anything done.  Huge Tetris failure!  It was harder when the pressure was on.  Hard to play when you are terrible!
I guess that is just the repetitiveness, I guess. I find it relaxing, if the music is on fast enough I can get to the top. The top? Not so much. I suppose it could make you anxious if you were close enough to the very top, but the repetitions and the slow music makes you mess up. I just find it to be relaxing.
I know, I was thinking about Spy Hunter and how it sped up when you play that game and it gets you anxious if you lose wihtin like 100 pieces, lord, you basically bet on that and lose wihin like $0, I'm thinking about spy hunter the other day and I was like, oh my, how did they play that, I would lose all my pieces, I basically bet $0.
I think I have and I am not very familiar with it.  Apparently the name of the game is spy hunter.  It's kind of a version of tetris.  I'm not sure what that is, but it has the tetris effect, or something like that.
Spy Hunter, commedore of all game.  I remember loving it in school.  It was fun when I drove my first car and had to run all of the basic basic cops/cops system on the system.  That was fun.  Video games are fun. I guess that's why we have video games.
Cool.  I'm not good either, but I do like old-school systems.  Sadly I was never that good at playing tetris.  We had a commodore 64 and I think it was the first system I ever had.  When I was in the game store, they had all of the old- school systems in the store, including an atari and a game boy to work on.  They had games on everything including the game boy.  It was like playing Tetris in a video game store.
I'm in the same boat with the smoking and the coffee addiction.  I was dragging out one of those cups today, it was a fun way to help with that.
I have a ton of nerdy hobbies.  I enjoy geocaching and running for example.  For starters, I'm a historical reenactor and Star Wars costumer for the legion.  Also a historical Reenactor for the Star Wars legion, so I enjoy it.
I have a full time job that I wake up to at 4:30 and I teach college.  I have 2 kids a wife and 2 kids, and I wake at 2 to lift them up.  So, I get a lot of hits at 6:30 to get them up and going.  It's free and I get 6:00 to 4:00.  No kids, no kids a wives and no kids.  We get by.
Dang, you work a full time job and a side gig and a single cat and a cat for a side job? I'm not a morning person. I do work out, but that's like catching up on sleep after a long geocaching trip. I'm still catching up with that list.
That's tough for me as well.  I like waking up before dawn to get started and get some time with the nature before it gets tough again.  If I can get some relaxing and clears my mind before I have to be up, it is a great option.  It would be wise to try something more relaxing and clearing my mind, though.
I guess you're not the only one, I don't go to bed early either, I typically go to sleep around midnight or so, I guess it's not that long, but I don';t want to get up at midnight or anything like that.
That was what I thought as I cut down on bed before 11pm and thought I would go to the gym at night, so that makes sense. I'm proud to say that I've never been to the Gym before midnight, even on a Friday since the gym is open before 9 pm. I don't think I'll do it on a friday though, but it makes sense, I don;t think I could go to a gym at all if the gym was open before midnight.
That's pretty intimidating!  I cut out the tv as well.  I don't pay for cable but I just watch stuff online or buy DVDs.  My running group has a schedule is saturdays, tuesdays and the evenings so I do it.  If I could do it on my own my schedule would be better.
I figure that you are intimidated, so I might fake it, but it is intimidating, what about you?
Fair enough.  My mantra is the same no matter what, no matter how I partake in bad habits or whether or not I run away from a group.  I will run away, but I won't partake in drinking and drinking video games.  If I run fast and win at that age and at that speed, I will win awards and be the best in my group. I have a saying that goes something like this: "Run, couch, run."  It's like a running mantra or a mantra.  No doubt, it helps me keep up with the game and keep my mind off my drinking and running.
That is true. Nice chatting with you.
Have you ever played Tetris?
Yes, one of my favorites!  I love it and learned how to pack things, pack things for the fridge, etc.  It is on top sellers and still one of the top sellers to this day!
Tetris has its principles about how to accommodating things in the trunk, too. I like the principles of it, but I don't know that I can see the benefits of it other then to help me quit smoking.
ohhh, I didnt know that, I wonder if it can help stop smoking.  I have a Playstation 3 so I wonder how I can do that.
I think so, it's nice to know, but sticking to a diet is difficult, you can get addicted to the game and stop that.  I have to stop thinking about food, I have a game andStop it!
Yeah youre totally right, its not just about health, it is about addiction to a playstation game, the department of defense actually uses a PlayStation game for that addiction,
That would be cool.. and a cheaper option if they want to build a super computer that is like a Playstation 3.  I would think the PlayStation is the way to go to build that.  Or maybe even build a Super computer.
Wow so cool. I feel like I have seen that movie in my life before. There have been more movie and TV wins than any other awards or innovations in the history of the Playstation in my history.
I also like Playstation 3's, I know that they are going to use it to research black holes. I wonder why?
That is cool that is happening, what kind of music they listening to? Jazz?
I love jazz.  One of my favorite types of jazz is gypsy jazz!
I do!  There are great piano players like the women from Harlem who make music!
I do not, but I find this sort of things.  Jazz is so unique.  I do know of a woman who holds a concert on Sundays for 20 years.  She is the only woman to do so.
Yea and Pakistan's jazz is at the top of the list, I think it's cool to find that out, I wonder if that's on the list too
I would be great to see jazz from Pakistan. I would like to hear this orchestra from Pakistan and then jazz from America and Europe.
I'm guessing rich in tradition, and maybe they stay connected to the African Americans, I'm guessing they're also rich in Tradition.
Jazz has traveled and is a great part of the African American culture.  It is one of the first things adopted from African Americanculture, and it is from West Africa.
I think it came back to America to refine it.  I used to listen to it as a kid, mostly the fatter tempo stuff.
Another famous actor who loves jazz is Clint Eastwood.
No, I didn't know that. That makes him kinda a poser if he's a fan.
I don't like him either. It was nice to talk with you today, have a good one!
Do you like Tom Cruise?
I like the Shogun, I know the plural form of it is samurai.
Hmm I thought it referred to the last samurai?
Yeah, it is a reference to a clan of samurai from one clan of Samurai
Yes, that is cool. Tom sued the inventor of the hoveround, Kruse, for $67,000. I wonder why?
Wow.  I didn't know that.  Did you know that Aladdin's face was based on Tom?  I wonder how close he is to being Tom.  Aladdin face wasbased on Tom.
Cool. Seinfeld has more money than Tom Hanks and Cruise.
Wow, I wonder how much money that is?
I think it is $32 million, so he has a net worth of $500 million
Wow that is a lot, he was on a cruise kick, he went on a cruises with Trey Parker and Matt Stone and also Paramount. I wonder if they went on the cruise together, Trey Parker was on the Cruise kick with both Matt Stone.
Wow!  Cruise spent two years in Japan, preparing for his role as the last samurai in the last Samurai, preparing himself for the role in the next one.
Wow, that is dedication. Cruise was also an honorary citizen of Paris.
Wow he must have rubbed them the wrong way or got rubbed all the way in, I think they can't do anything wrong
I guess!  Did you ever watch Avengers: Infinity War?
I did!  It was the first film shot with digital Imax cameras.
Nice. I like the guy who played Jarvis in Iron Man, I like all the films he has been in. Do you know who the guy is?
Cool. Did you know the first avengers movie had a waitress that Captain America saves from becoming a waitress?
No, I have no idea. Who was it?
It is Gretchen in recess
Nice. Did you know disney is not allowed to show the big name Marvel characters in the parks east of Mississippi? They can only show them at the parks north of Mississippi.
Wow that is strange, must be some legal issues or something.
Hi, how are you this evening?
Pretty well, how about you?
I'm great, I really like Tom Cruise. He's in all the films I like.
I do, I liked Mission: Impossible 1 and 2 and The Last Samurai.
Yes, he is pretty dedicated. He spent two years learning Japanese and swordplay in preparation for the filming of the last samurai, and he spent two Years learning Japanese
That's hardcore dedication, especially considering that Aladdin's face was based on his own.
Funny that he made the connection.  He was a bit out of touch with the average person's reality.  I think the aliens are in touch with us and have already made the Connection.  But, he decided to spend $15 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens.  Why $15 Million?  He decided to Spend $15M to protect his underground bunker.
Well, that's money well done!  I wonder how much he has invested in it.  I think he's got some money.
I think he could sell it for the right price, but I'm sure he would sell it at a profit since he has celebrity status, and the price of a Star Wars films is usually quite a profit. Are you a fan of the movies?
Yeah I am, I think it's possible.. And yeah, the city of Paris put up a ban, I wonder why the city didn't lift the ban
Paris banned Tom Cruise? Why?
They put a ban on declaring him an honorary citizen, I wonder why.
I wonder why they did that.  I think the star wars films have really lost their magic.  They are old, but they still have some value.
yeah, the first three movies were really good and then it went downhill from there.  the next three movies, not so much.
 lucas and his wife (his wife) are the ones that make him and george the most billions.  He won an Oscar once, but he did not win an oscar for best actor.  I wonder if that is why he did it?  He did not want to make another.  Maybe he did so that he could get billions.
She derves it, she has made some remarkable ones, she even wrote the script for one.
Yeah, George was very creative but he did not have a guiding hand on things, he did have trouble with story structure and was not creative enough to focus the story structure.
Yeah, I know. 20th Century Fox thought the movie was going to flop. They said that they thought the film would not do well.
The rest is history, James Earl Jones was paid $75,000 for the rights to the movie and $500,000 more for merchandising.  Lucas got $500k and the franchise has made many people rich.  I wonder how much James Earl Jones was paid for the merchandise rights to Lucas?
Yeah, that's pretty remarkable, especially knowing how far the strike came.  He is a genius and did it without even knowing.
I enjoyed chatting with you about Abrams. I will keep in touch with you, have a good evening.
Do you like movies?  Do you like them?
Good afternoon.  I do enjoy movies, I watch about one a month.  There is one that is about to release every other month. Do you enjoy movies?
Cool, I admire that as well.  I really like the star wars series which started in 1977 and I think is really cool.
I do enjoy them, I can't wait to see the last Star Wars, save for the middle one, I think it's going to be an epic anthology, I don't know if I will enjoy it, I like "The Last Star Wars" but can't really wait to go see it, what about you?
I wonder if they will be dubbed in Navajo, they did that back when they were alive, I don't think they have dubbed in anything since
It's fascinating how it's been translated into so many different languages and even released in 86 countries and has been released in over 200 languages.
I imagine it has to be at least in a few different languages.  It would be neat if it was the first major film put out in an American native langauge, I can imagine.
That is awesome!  I have no idea that Star Wars has ever been a major film ever translated into aNative American language.  That is still relevant, especially since I live in the Navajo community where it is still very relevant.
I would imagine so, I found interesting that Marcia Lucas, George's wife influenced the movies, I can't imagine how that would have been possible.
I heard she had a lot of input and influence on scenes and characters on the movie, I bet she had an solid relationship with him, she must have had a a lot on the movies, she had to have a lot and influence and influence
Yes, after Obi Wans death. I wish Leia good luck kiss her! She did a good job and actually won an academy award for it, so that's a good thing!
She won an Oscar for Star Wars!  Carrie Fisher does some very vivid and iconic scenes for sure.  Luke and Leia are brother and sister.  The one where Luke is in the hospital is one that she did well.
Yes, she did!  I think I like the pure fiction that all of Darth Vader's lines were recorded in only 2.5 hours - that means that all his lines wererecorded in just 2.25 hours.
I believe it was 2.5 hours, with all the heavy breathing and all that they had to speak in those 2 hours.
Hahaha, that is true. James Earl Jones got paid for that.
My favorite childhood memory of Star Wars is the Vader's voice in "Journey to the Center" - it's such a unique and creepy voice. I can't calm down at the same time when I hear Vader'svoice - it doesn't calm me down.
They must have paid him well, he was stuck in their minds, and he paid them well.
That is not fair, but it is a billion dollar industry so I think it is the right idea for him to have the best idea in a billiondollar industry
From my perpective, Star Wars was so succesful in merchandising that it holds a guiness record, so it was doing fine on its own.  It was big enough to be succesFUL in merch and TV.
It is amazing how far it has come in all aspects. Even the new jedi was awesome.
They really make us dream. Nice talking with you.
Hi!  Do you like Star Wars?
Absolutely!  You?  Do you?
I think it is an awesome franchise. It was the first major film ever to be dubbed in Navajo. I wish there were more languages for people to enjoy it.
That is pretty cool!  Did you hear that the entire Star Wars is about a hundred of years old?  They told us the first Jedi was actually a hundred years old!
Wow!  I can't even wrap my mind around that.  George Lucas' wife did not put all of the details about the film, but she did get an Academy Award for editing, and her husband got an Academy award for directing.  I wonder what else she put in the film?
Yeah that is amazing. Have you watched Avengers: Infinity War?
I haven't seen it but I hear that the film was the first one to be shot completely with Digital Imax cameras.
Yeah it was, but the movie is coming out next month, the last movie left off with a pretty big cliff hanger, so the next movie is going to be out in one month, yeah.
Interesting. So this is the third in the trilogy.
It is a trilogy, but I had no idea there was a trilogy.  I like the first movie better, The avenger series.
Wow, so you like to eat Shawarma? I like the films. Do you like it?
Yeah Tony Stark talks about eating shawarma,  I think thats the only thing they have lol.  I wonder if hes eating that in any of them,  yeah Tony Stark talk about eating it.
I wonder if shawarma sales increased?
Me too,  I have one of those all the time.  It is a big scene lol amazing how it changes with each scene.
Haha, I used to watch The Hulk when I was younger. I guess Lou Ferrigno who voiced the Hulk voiced it for decades even though he was younger, I guess Hulk voiced in The Avengers Age of Ultron.
Yeah hes still making money from the movies lol, and yeah hes still doing it, that is amazing, the guy who does the voice of jarvus was only 18 for that role, thats amazing, I wonder how much that guy got for that voice in the movies
Wow.  I would think he has seen them all by now.
I have no clue.  I thought it was because of hollywood movie premieres lol
Good point. I'll have to catch up watching some of the movies now. I know Tom Cruise has a bunker in case there are aliens in the movies... like Tom Cruise does in Aliens. I wonder if he has a " bunker" in the bunker in the Bunker in case something happens to him...
lol, that is interesting, I wouldnt mind a little alien bunker, its interesting that Aladdins Face is based on Tom Cruise, I did not know Aladdin's face is based in an alien bunker. lol
I did not notice that, but they look alike.  I wonder why they look so much alike?
Did you ever play Tetris when you were younger?
I did and I loved Teris on game boy, did you?
I liked it too.  I think I had a PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 in my hands.  Have you heard about the version that is virtual reality grabbing the blocks?
I read about that, but I wonder if the environment would improve. I think it would be considered tetris. I don't think I like that type of game.
It's jaw dropping. I played it on a Playstation 2 system and I was totally addicted. I can't afford that new system, so my son has the money and has played it thinking it's a good way to get some money off of it. I'm thinking of getting a Dead Red redemption system, but I don't know if I can afford it.
I have addidcted to that one as well!  It scares me.  They have designers who are not really what they seem.
I was thinking the same.  People are used to sitting in chairs hours on end staring straight ahead.  I used to sit in chairs years ago too and just end staring Straight Ahead and nothing moving.  Then it started coming home and I would just sit in bed, moving my body around.  Now I can't even sit still in VR!  I am coming home from work and just sitting in my chair, thinking about what I did last night and thinking.  How about you?
I absolutely agree and Tetris is a puzzle game that requires fast thinking and the use of geometric skills.  It takes brain skills and I absolutely agree.
I was surprised to find out that it does have positive effects. I know that people suffering from ptsd are often surprised to see people start playing it again. I was surprised that the original version had to stick to diets and such.
Yeah that is an interesting fact. Another interesting fact is that the game has 3 versions and there are even versions for the Android and Apple devices for free. The demand for the game is set so super high for a product, but there is no demand for a PS4. I think it is more for the age of the game itself. Oh boy I have to go now.
I think I would be more able to handle it if I had a console I could play GTA V, flight simulators, and researching black holes, I think I could handle it.
I was reading about Tetris selling over 300 million copies of the franchise, that's enormous!
I guess it is.  I guess it was copyrighted by the Soviet Union and the original creator got no royalties.  But they did have free versions.  It was started so that there would be free versions and not be copyrighted.
I know right! I don't know what got him involved with that game, I was involved with the first version and Sony just took the whole thing and did their own version, but the first game was terrible, never really caught on, the Wii Sports is top 3 selling game now
I did not know that.  Do you play any games on the PlayStation?  The game Rez was designed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, a Japanese designer.  I had not heard of him, but the game Rez: The Last game on the Playstation was actually designed by him.  Did you play it?
I play some mobile games, but not too much. I'm a heavy gamer by no stretch of the imagination, but I play some Xbox games like Madden and NBA. What about you?
I like the XBoxs, I love tennis games, I don't really follow sports anymore because I'm not into sports games. I do go hiking sometimes though, I really like hiking in the mountains. Do you play any pss?
That's good!  outdoors is a good way to get healthy stuff in.  It pulls people together and you don't have to worry about anything but healthy stuff.
I don't know. I would recommend it. I find it relaxing and I can find it useful for sure. I play mobile games too. Have you heard of ELOH?
I like the Clash of Clones genre, Clash of clans genre, clash royale ect.  I like the social aspect of playing with others versus solo.  Do you like the whole social aspect?
That sounds good but I think it would get boring.  There is all the hype about Candy Crush.  I need to check it out.  The department of defense had to build a supercomputer out of a bunch of playstation 3's to build one of those.  Sounds good, but they did build a Supercomputer out a bunch  of playstations to do it.
Wow! I did not know that, what an interesting factoid.
Hello, are you a fan of movies?
I enjoy movies and think Jurassic World was an interesting film, it was the first interesting film I have seen since Jurassic World
I enjoyed it immensely.  I think I liked it more than the original film.  How about you?
I heard Fallen Kingdom is pretty good.
I guess I should check it out.  He has a talent for telling stories, I think.  Michael Crichton also told good stories, not the same stuff that Spielberg does, but still good stories.
True, I've seen a few of his movies, but I've never seen an elephant can roar, have you?
I heard elephant roars! It is a great sound effect and it is pretty scary in person, I think.
Did you know the original plan of human-raptor hybrid soldiers?
That would have been great! A raptor army that would invade countries, stop the terrorists, conquer Mars, and invade countries.
The dinosaurs came to the US during the cretaceous era.  I've never seen a movie about the Jurassic era.
I guess that is because the era determines the creatures in the film. The guy who did the show is not Chris Pratt, I guess he did not like dinosaurs in the first film.
Yes, it was Chris Pratt, he used to be on the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation.
Yes I liked that show.  He was really funny in that show,  his character was really clever and not stupid like the character in that other show,
Yes he was nominated for best comedy series and best supporting actor for best supporting Actor in a comedy series in 1997.
Yes he won and it was well deserved. I think Pratt got cheated out of that one. He should have won for his work at the restaurant!
He did, he was a fan of food and had to lose 80 pounds to land a film role.
30 pounds? wow, I guess he made enough money to put that weight back on, he was a big guy, he must of been around 300 pounds,
Yes, he was quite heavy. Captain Kirk was another movie star that was also heavy. He is close to that.
I think he did, he is a pretty good Kirk. I think Star Trek Wars is better than Star Wars though, I liked Star Trek more.
I'm sure he would be happier with a role in Guardians of the Galaxy.
It was a really fun film! I liked it. I gotg to go. Thanks for the chat!
You too, I'm going to watch Chris Pratt in Moneyball!
Do you like movies? I like them.
I really do. Have you been watching a show called Westworld?
I have not seen that one either, have you seen Jurassic World?
I like that too, it stars Evan Rachel Wood, she plays a character named delores, she is pretty good, she also plays aCharacter named del Lore
Oh that is cool, I will have to check it out.
Yeah, it is pretty good, better than jurassic park.
Me too. Have you seen The Fallen Kingdom?
I have not. Have you?
It is a film that is the second film in the series, the first is the first one was jurassic park.  This one has dinosaurs and its only about 50 min but its about the dinosaurs from the first series
That is crazy! I did not know that!
Yeah, I know right. The first Jurassic Park ride cost $300.00. I wonder how much the second Jurassic Parkride cost.
Yeah it only cost $15 million to make the movie but the ride alone would have cost $50 million toMake the movie
I figure if the raptors in jurassica park were made, they would be even more.
Yeah they were actually humans inside of suits! Hilarious!
Hahah yeah.  It took them 4 hours to render one frame of a rain soaked t-rex.
Yeah that is hilarious. Did you know there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans?
No, I did not, I am curious to know more about it.  What is it?
Me too, I'm not sure what kind of a frequency it is but I'm worried about the frequency
At this point, if we can't find out, we'll probably never find out.  Did you know we can grow a rib in just 2-3 months and it will last for a while?
That is shocking.  I did not know that.
I don't know how but they study them. It was a nice chat, have a good one.
Hello.  I thought we were still on the moon.  What do you think of it?
Hello, yes I have. I hear moon dust cute through kevlar like material.
Did you know that it can cause a type of hay fever?
It is, but kevlar is a strong material, so it is used in helmets or protective gear as well as protective clothing, not sure if it is kevlAR
Do you know why they put it on the US flag?
Yeah lol thats funny, I hear the highest point on the moon is 1938 meters higher than Mt Everest, I wonder why?  I hear it's about 2000 meters higher, I'd think it would be more like the highestPoint on the Moon!
Wow that blows my mind!  It was formed from an asteroid impact when it was first formed.
I wonder if that's why Mars's moon is so hollow, it is so much hollow
I did not know that.
Really? How is that possible?
Phobos is their moon.
Phobos and Deimos?
Methane bases life believed on Titan.
I'm not sure what that means.
True.    There is a moon of saturn that might have life on it.  I think it is the only one.
I dont believe it.  I dont think its methane base life.  LOL
ahh...I hear life on the earth is possible...
I do not know either. Do you like the violin?
I do, I love the sound of the fiddle, do you?
Yes, I hear you! I like that the violin that is made out of stone and is fully playable, I wonder if it is made of just one stone when you hear it.
Oh wow, I don't think my neck would hurt though haha. I wonder how it would hurt. It was nice talking to you, take care!
Great chat, you too.
Are you a Warner Brothers fan?  Did you happen to see Marvel's "Marvel: DC: The Next Marvel"?
I do like some of them.  I like superheroes and such.  You?
No, I don't like some of the characters. I like the movies though. I think it's interesting that the characters were developed in a way and developed into the way they are now. I love all the facts about them. Wonder Woman is the highest grossing origin movie and I love how it was the highestgrossing origin film.
That's pretty cool! Gal Gadot is a really nice woman. She's actually a soldier in the Israel defense forces and actually served two years as a soldier, that's pretty neat.
Yes, I love how well movies also work in true science, beauty and the beast. Wonder Woman is actually the 2nd highest grossing income movie of all time. Wonder woman has the third highest grossers income and the second highest grosser grossing movie.
That's really cool!  I didn't know that.  Gal Gadot was unaware of this when she was auditioning for Catwoman.  She thought she was testing for Cat Woman when she thought she wasn't auditioning.
I bet Gal Gadot didn't know she was going to be in the origin movie for a supergirl or a superman.  Warner Brothers is probably planning on a Superman cameo in the next Aquaman.  Wonder Woman is a good way for the Warner brothers to get some money off of DC work.
That would be cool. I wonder if they will use superman in that, it was published way back in 1938, right?
Oh wow I didn't know that either!  I know April 4, 1938 is the day that it was published correct?  Wonder if it was true that the first book was a true "superman" book.  I am fascinated that Superman once wielded Thor's hammer.  Wonder who did that?
I think it is really neat!  DC Comics paid $130 to get exclusive rights to superman.
Jon Cena has been in all the Warner Brothers movies, right?
Wonderwoman was made the secretary of the justice society, she appeared in The Wonder Woman was made in the Justice Society.
I strongly feel that Christopher Reeve and others gave new life to these stars. They are playing these roles in these days that we know only superman and wonderwoman, but I feel like they gave new Life to the stars.
Aww yeah he was great.  That's pretty cool.  In the year 2011, top grossing films were led by females.  I wonder which ones were in that year?
That is pretty cool.  Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster originally created Superman in 1938 and are millionaires after 40 years.  They are the only two millionaires ever.
They were the writers for superman and they also coined the term "mindiac." it was a pre-existing word that had already been used by other writers for Superman and the super-villain.
Interesting.  Brainiac is the word I think of when I think about Superman.  It is the name of a character from the world of Warcraft.  That kind of works since Henry Cavil almost missed the call to do the role of Superman by not playing in the World of Warcraft, and now he's playing Superman.
Haha, funny. In Sweden, it's illegal to name a child Metallica, Superman, Ikea and Elvis. Wonder why Superman doesn't have a veranda? I wonder why?
I wonder why?  Superheroes can be known and known by their known, but the unknown ones can make up the universe!
Good point.  But, isn't the universe cool enough for humans to touch it?  Some stars are far too far out for humans for humans To touch.
I thought there was a bight super hologram in the Universe?
I know people think that there is only one electron in the universe, and that there are only 1 electron in all of the universe.  Hard to believe.
That's hard to believe too.  I know there are so many in the observable universe.
True. Thanks for chatting!
Hello!  Do you like Superman?
Hi there, yes I do. I was disappointed to see that they are shifting their movies to the late 80's as I heard they are doing no Superman movies in the 2020s, but that's ok.
I think Superman is getting paid the best for being Superman.
I don't know, but I know it was way back in 1938! I wonder what they had to buy it for?
Marvel! I was thinking that was who it was.
Superman has been popular for a long time, the original writer and artist Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster have been around a long long time.
Yeah it has, Henry Cavill is one of them, he was the first one.
I know that he was in the recent Superman.  I know he was making a few movies in the making of it.
Yeah, he missed the call for Superman 3!
I guess we don't know about future Superman movies with Cavill. I don't think they have hope in continuing Aquaman in the future.
Do you know who they named the villain?
No, I don't.  Do you know if he existed?
Yeah that is true, I think they made up the name "brainiac" which I think is so true.
It seems like something that Ikea might deem important enough to have on their veranda.  Like Metallica, or Elvis, or what ever else they deem important!  Did you know that it's illegal to name your child Superman in Sweden?  I wonder what shows they can show on their TV that shows a child Superman?  Wonder if they can do that in the US?
Wow that's really interesting. Did you ever watch Wonder Woman?
Yes, great movie, it was the highest-grossing superhero movie of 2015.
Yeah, it is, it's the highest grossing WWI movie as well.
Gal Gadot, who plays Wonder Woman, said that she thought she was auditioning for the role of catwoman before she thought that she was actually auditioningfor the role!
Yeah, that is funny.
I think she is good at the role.  I wonder what her ability as a soldier was like.  For 4 years she served in the Israel Defense Services and was a good soldier.  So she might have the ability for the role
I bet she did a lot more than that. Nice chat, thanks a lot.
did you know that DC comics paid $130 for the exclusive rights to superman?
I like the superheros.  I recently heard that there was an actor playing superman for a while.
I love Henry Cavill as Superman, I really like the world of Warcraft, I think he's the best playing him in the world.  Did you know that Cavill almost missed the call of playing Superman?  Bummer.  He could have been the next Superman and now he's out.  I wonder if he'd have taken the role of Superman if he was in World of Warcraft?  Can't believe he almost got the role.
Unbelievable! Wonder Woman was the most successful DCEU release in North America.
That's crazy lol.  The writers for super-villain were actually the same writers for Superman, and coined the term "brainiac" as a pre-existing word for "super-villian" which is crazy lol
That's pretty cool. Superman gained the ability to fly at the request of Fleischer studios because animating it was difficult. They repeated the jumps in the 1960s at the behest of Fleisher studios because Animating a big jump like that is difficult.
I wonder how Superman would do if he could fly? I wonder if he'd fly on the veranda? In sweden it is illegal to name your child Metallica, Ikea and Elvis. I wonder why Superman would name his child MetallICA? haha
Interesting! I didn't know that. There was a version of Superman created where Superman was raised in the Soviet Union. I wonder why that version of Superman created?
That's weird. I wonder if it was worthy of being seen. Superman once wielded Thor's hammer because he was the only one worthy of it.
That's neat. Marvel comics creator stan lee wrote 15 DC novels, re-imagining popular superheroes such as batman and superman.
Good call! Wonder Woman, gal gadot, served two years in the Israel defense forces as a soldier of the metal. She is a soldier in the "Wonder Woman" trilogy.
That is awesome! I wonder if she will be in the Lego movie. The first Lego movie was the first feature film to have a woman in it.
Whoa, that's interesting! I never would have thought that. Gal Gadot was unaware of that. She was auditioning for Wonder Woman, and also testing for catwoman, when she thought she was audition for Wonderwoman.
Wonder Woman first appeared in 1941. She worked as a secretary for the Justice Society and was the first member of the group made in her favor.
Omg LOL.  Wonder Woman is a secretary lol  I wonder what her super powers are,  she could have a hot tin roof like a secretary.  I think she could be a super heroine.  Did you know that the 5 highest grossing domestic films were female led,  Star Wars,  Auntie Mame,  Hot Tin Roof,  South Pacific,  The South Pacific and  Star wars 2.  The last two films were male led.  So I wonder if Wonder Woman will be a female led film?  Or will be like the old "untie mame" from "Auntie" on "Ain't It Cool How it Rained"  lol
William Moulton Marston, the inventor of the Wonder Woman, created Wonder Woman and she wields a "lasso of truth" which is like a lie detector test that she can use when she goes through a lie detectors test.
Ahhh interesting.  I did not know that.  Ahhhhhh interesting!
There is a silver coin with superman on the heads side that is legal tender in Canada.  A coin with Superman is also legal tender on the Heads side.
Lucky Canada! I wonder what they use it for?
hahaha  The woman's invisible jet is going to be in the Smithsonian in a special one day viewing on 9 April,  it's the Woman's Invisible Jet.  That is going be special one night only only.  I wonder when it will be available.
Hahaha thats hilarious. Well, it was good talking to you.
Do you know much about the moon?
I love the moon!  I love to watch a full moon.  I would love to see another full moon!
i dont usually pay attention but i do know that it's shaped by the human culture and we dont usually know that.
Did you know that Earth is the third planet from the moon, Mars has a moon named Phobos, it's the only moon named phobos
Yes, all planets have moons!  I wonder if the shows that they face are actually synchronized, or if they are synchronized.
I wonder what the highest point on the moon is.
I have no idea, I can only imagine it is about 4x as high, I wonder if it is bigger than the earth or how big it is, I would imagine it to be bigger,
I know right, Mt. Everest is almost 2000 mts higher,
Whoa.. high? i think i wouldnt try that high. i could fall and probably die. i would not want to climb that far in low gravity. i can die in the low gravity too.
Me neither. I wonder who wanted to put it up? They did put an American flag up on the moon but no one wanted toPut it up on our flag.
Yeah, I heard that the Chinese have their flag that is bleached white.  I wonder if that has to do with the radiation hitting the other flags or the radiation from the radiation we get, I think the chinese flag would be the same.
Hey, I don't think it is true, but that's what I think.  Do you like music?
I love music, what kind of music do you like?
I love all kinds of music.  I can play violin, rock, I can also play the bass, I play violin.
I think the violin is a great instrument, but the bass player is the fussy instrument for the band. The bass player has to be the best one in the band, or else.
I found interesting that einstein played the violin.  He did not play the piano.
I think his intellectual mind needs many outlets, including creative and other outlets for his intellectualMind
There have been great scientists, great artists, great scientists.
Great scientists and also great artists are both great artists! Anyway, great chat!
That's great I agree, music is just great I like it.  Talk to you soon, talk to you about astronomy.
Have a good night! I will, and you too!
You too! Thanks! You too!
I really enjoy writing poetry.  I can relate to poets of centuries ago.  Do you enjoy writing?
Cool!  Do you enjoy reading as well?
I do, I love the Iliad and the Odyssey. I lived in Italy for a while and studied it when I there, I actually love the iliad because I lived there and also the Odyssey!
Wow! That paid off. I remember reading Edgar Allan Poe in school and was shocked when I found out he only got $9 for the Raven. I also remember reading Edward Allan Poe when I was in school.
Wow, I wonder how much money that was? Demetri Martin had a 224 word palindrome poem. I wonder if he got any money for that.
I hope so.  I wonder if it was hard?
There is a poem that is so depressing that when read normally it is inspiring when read backwards, but when read forwards is depressing.
That is awesome, I would like to read that one some time.
Me too. I want to study some Javanese, there is a poem that if you read their alphabet in order you can read the poem. I wonder if you have to read their Alphabet in order to do that.
That is so cool, there are poetic people in java!
I don't know. I do know there is a violin made of stone that is playable. I wonder how big it is and how big is the violin made.
Wow, a violin made in stone?  Is it fully playable?  I would think that the stone would have to be a gifted violin maker to have it fully played.
I am sure, modern violins have come a a ways in the years and even techniques have improved a lot, blind sound tests and other techniques have Improved so much that modern violin are preferred over stradivarious ones in blind sound test
I thought the stradivarious was the best sounding in the world, but my hairdresser plays violin and she's pretty good.  I hear Albert Einstein liked the piano better, but I hear piano is the way to go.
I thought so too. The greatest scientists are artists.
That makes sense. It's funny my hairdresser calls me the violin. She calls me that because she refers to the local bluegrass boys in our town. I sh'e always seen them jamming to the symphony with the fiddle or the violin or the fiddling and she calls it the "bluegrass boys". Makes sense they'd be jamming out to the violin...
Larry from the 3 Stooges was great on the violin, he was the best.
Yeah I think I heard he burned his other arm so badly with acid that he took violin lessons to strengthen the damaged parts of his arm, I think he took lessons to stronger the damaged part.
Did you know he went to the European music conservatory?
Yes, good thing he did that. I liked the Three Stooges movies as a kid, they were really funny to watch.
I'm a big fan of the old science stuff like watching people go to the moon and all that.  But I don't know how much I like the new science stuff.
Very cool. I had fun chatting with you! Enjoy the rest of the day!
hi, do you like poetry?
I do enjoy poetry. What about you?
I do, actually.  I recently discovered a new poem that is depressing, but inspiring when you read it backwards - if you readIt backwards it becomes inspiring!
woah a lot of talent there, Edgar Allan Poe was one of them, he had a lot
Yes, I do, how about you?
He was so famous! I bet he would have liked the poem The Raven. It was from his poem The Rotten.
I have heard that poem, it is very interesting, very dark, very interesting
It is one of my favorites, it is really dark it is very interesting and also a really cool fact that the poem has been sold for $1,500 dollars, cool fact, veryDark poem
That is a shame, I wonder how popular it became.
It is a shame because it is a beautiful astronomical body and one of his most famous poems is about the Moon.  It's not a bad deal for a poems about a beautiful, beautiful astronomical bodies.
The moon is also really hollow, it is weird that it is the largest moon on mars, but it is hollow, so it must be the largest Moon on mars!
That is cool but the moon dust can be dangerous. I wonder if they keep moon dust in it?
I wonder that too,  moon hay fever doesnt sound good,  I wonder why?  hay fever  doesnt sound like a good way to get over something like that.
I agree.  That doesnt sound good.  Did you hear that on Apollo 11 NASA wanted to place the American flag on the moon?  Did they place it there because the mission was the only one to go to the moon.  I would have placed it on the American Flag.
LOL yeah that is funny.  I did hear about that.  Did you hear that there is evidence of methane based life on the moon of Saturn?  They think there is also evidence of Methane based life in the moon.
Woah that would be cool to see.  I wonder if we will find smart life in Mars, there is intelligent life there or maybe there is life hiding under the planet.  Telescopes could find smart Life hiding in the planets.
There was a scary movie about Mars having life, I think.
I bet that was a scary movie, on a different note do you know how to play the violin, I bet it is a really scary movie.
No I haven't learned how to yet!
No I wish I could, I think its a nice instrument but it is hard to say if you could learn how to play it or not, but I want to some day, it is a nice instruments, I want the learn how it is really hard
Are you a piano person?
Piano. Not sure I like violin or fiddle, but I call it the piano. Anyway, I enjoyed talking to you! Great chat!
Thanks for the chat!  You too!!
Hi!  Do you like superhero movies?
I love them!  How about you?
Did you know that Superman first appeared in the comic book in 1939?
I did not know that DC comics paid $130 for the exclusive rights to Superman.
That is a bargain!  It is illegal to name your child superman in Sweden, even though there is a child super Superman in Sweden.
That is crazy, Superman is one of the most lucrative superhero franchises, but I'm not sure why. Do you know why?
Henry Cavill almost missed the call to do the role of Superman in the world of Warcraft.  He was considering playing himself.  I wonder if he would have been able to take the role?
Did you know that woman have never been in any of the movies?
I do. I like Wonder Woman the highest-grossing WWI movie and also the highest-, and Wonder Woman's highest- grossing superhero origin movie
I didnt know that, Wonderwoman served 2 years as Asoldier to the Israel defense in the 70's.
I didn't know that either.  That's pretty cool!  Wonder woman first appeared in 1938.  I wonder if she is a member of the Justice Society of the US, or if she was a member before?
I thought it was ok.  She was auditioning for the role of cat woman.  I didn't like that at all.
That is funny. Wonder Woman appeared in the first Batman vs. Superman and the second Batman vs..Superman
Lets talk about universes next. There are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection like we do on earth. Some species are different than the ones on Earth.
Interesting.  The universe is the contents of all space and time, stars, stars and other forms of matter and energy, plus galaxies, including planets, and other planets in the universe.  There is also space and space between planets and between stars.
Did you know the universe might be one giant superhologram?
That is freaky, I think. I wonder what that means. There is a region of space that may be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe.
I read that somewhere.  There's also a theory that there is only 1 electron in the universe.  I wonder what that means.
I learned a lot thanks for chatting.
I do, I will look up more information about the universe later today. Have a nice day and thanks for all the information!
Thank you, you too!
Hello, have you seen the movie Batman?
Hi!  I do.  I like it because it was originally based on the DC Comics!
Not sure but there are plans to build a gotham city theme park.
That is cool. I think the idea was based on a vinci flying machine.
Oh wow, nice.  Did you know Smallville is actually supposed to be about DC Comics and not Batman?
Nice. I wonder if Batman will be in the next one. I know that Victoria offers, but I think he will go with Batman
Wow, I wonder why they do that. Michael keaton opposed batman forever, but then he was going to reprise the role in the new Batman. Did you know Michael Keaton opposed Batman forever?
Wow that is interesting. Do you like comedy?
I love them. I know Demetri Martin is one of the best. He was in Harvard law and dropped out to go to law and drop out of Harvard law.
Wow.  I guess he is pretty sure that he regrets that.  He is pretty well known for comedy.
Have you heard of bromantic comedies?
Hmm I have, are they a special kind of comedy?
Yes they are comedies that are romances between friends, the Hangover is one of them, and the other is the Hang over.
Yes that makes a lot of sense. Do you ever watch comedy central?
I watch it sometimes. Is it good?
Yeah, but they cancelled over 100 shows since 1989, I wonder how many of those shows they have cancelled
I guess that is a lot since they have been around for so long, since 1989.
True. Did you know that the programming language python is also known as python?
I have heard of it, is it related to comedy?
It is a british comedy group. Monty Python.
That is pretty sweet that they immortalized it.
Hello, are you a Batman fan? Michael Keaton recently gave a commencement speech at Kent State and ended it by saying that he's a Batman.
Hi! I love the batman movie. Bale did a great job. I think Keaton did a better job too.
Yea, too bad Michael Keaton turned down $10 million to reprise his role in batman forever, Val Kilmer would have been the one to do it, he got $75 million for his role, toobad Michael Keaton turned down the $10 Million to do a role in Batman Forever
Yeah that is a lot of money and he got blacklisted after that, that is not a lot.
That sucks!  He also dissapointed Universal studios never made a real Gotham City.
Yeah, I think it would have been cool if it was in NYC, I definetly would have liked to see the newer Batman ones.
I guess there is a Russian version of Batman that teams up with a teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.
Yeah, that is interesting. I used to watch TMNT when I was younger.
Yea I liked that show, but I didn't watch the other movies that were on. I enjoyed Batman more though, I really enjoyed Batman.
Nice, I watched that one as well! I saw the first Batman with Eaton and Jack. Have you seen any of the Batman movies?
Yea, I didn't read the comics, I just watched the movies thought I read the Comics, apparently Stan Lee wrote some re-imagined batman comics, maybe someone who watched the films and watched the books and the movies Thought they were better than they were in the comics
I think I read that somewhere.  I am not familiar with that at all.  Did you know that Dark Knight rises made over $1 billion?
I didn't know that either, very impressive. I also like comedy movies, and apparently Bill Murray really enjoyed them. Apparently Kung Fu Hustle is suppose to be one of his best comedy movies ever, very funny.
I do like Murray, he is a great actor, I haven't seen Kung Fu Hustle, what is it about?
No I haven't, its hard to find online I've heard a lot of good things about it, Bill Murray calling it "the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy" but it's hard tofind online I heard a couple of good good things though about it
Do you like movies like Caddyshack?
Yea I think Caddy Shack was great. I liked it a bunch. I like the stripe, stripes, the ghost busters, and the ghostbusters too.
I can't believe the actor that played Egon from Ghostbusters passed away.  What a shame.
Demetri Martin was the first to graduate from Harvard law before dropping out out of boredom to become a lawyer.
That's a good question. He is a famous director too.
Yea, he directed Ghostbusters. Nice talking with you, I think I'm going to go look up what he directed.
Awesome, you too, he is a great comedian.
Hey how are you doing? You wanting to join the millions and watch the world cup this year?
I can't wait!  I am in North America, it is too expensive to travel to Russia.  It is expensive to Travel to Russia!
Yea, thats a good point. I dont like flying of any sort, sort of like the fact that the United States got 3rd place in the first FIFA World Cup in 1930. It would have been neat to see it again.
The US men haven't won a world cup since 1930, which is slightly surprising. I thought that the US would at least be in the top 3 or 4. The men are a lot of talented countries though, so that is slightly surprise to me.
Yeah, that is odd. There are a lot of talent.I learned that there are no net economic gains for the countries that have played host to the Olympics.  That is amazing to me.  I think the US has a lot to do with that and also a lot with talent.
I know countries have part to do with the infrastructure when they host an Olympic games, but it costs a lot and a lot end up building stadiums and arenas that are later abandoned. I wonder how much those countries have to pay to host an olympic games, since a lot of it is already in place and they end upBuilding stadiums and arena.
Thats a good point, totally makes sense.
The only problem with Brazil and China recently is that the stadiums are completely different.
Wow, that is sort of sad. Do you follow the player Cristiano Ronaldo the pro footballer from Portugal?
He's had a rough couple of months. He's been in many headlines recently.
Yeah, I heard that he was expelled from school for throwing a chair at a teacher.  That seems a little extreme to me.  I don't like how he got kicked out of school for threw a chair.
I know right, a lot of schools have a zero tolerance policy for that these days, I think a lot more schools have that.
That's true I think it is a good rule.  I think he is a very good person and a good person.  The thais have a rule that a person has to donate blood or have tattoos of their body in order to be worthy to be able to donate.  He refuses to do it because he refuses to have any tattoos.
Yes, he has a lot of great qualities.  I like that he doesn't speak Portuguese, but he doesn's speak it naturally.  He has tried to speak it but was chastised by reporters for making a fun of the other person attempt to ask him that in an interview.  When he attempted to speak Portuguese he was chastized by reporters and told to speak English, but later he was able to tell reporters for Making fun of him because he was the only person to speak Spanish in an Interview.
That is so nice of him to do.  He wants people to stick up for themselves and not be bullies.  I think the media needs to do that more, haha.
I don't care for the showboat that he was originally known as.  I think he is cocky and trying to show off, and he earned a little bit of a showboat on the football field.  He is not the way to do it.  Do you care?
Yeah he has a personality that is for sure. I think it would be funny if players had to wear a hat that had the most popular hat in history, like the bowler hat or the cowboy hat, but yeah, he would have to wear the most most popularHat, the bowlers, the cowboy, the Bowler hat.
I bet it stayed on your head well on a windy day.  I think they got a lot smaller on aWindy day and so I bet it's stayed on.
Yeah, it probably would have. The origins of the conical party hat are derived from dunce caps. They were worn at parties to encourage foolish and silly behavior,lol. I like a lot of parties where you wear a lot.
I wonder how many dunce caps at parties they have earned?
I have not, have you?
I had fun chatting with you today! Have a good one!
Hey how's it going, do you wear a hat much? I'm personally bald and have to wear aHat all the time lol, but I don't know why I can't do it, I'm not personally bald.
Haha that is funny.
Haha, good for you! They look silly on me too! I guess I have a shaped head so I look silly too! British politicians used to wear a top hat until 1998. I wonder why?
That's really interesting, and yes I think the royal canadian mounted police hats look pretty cool.
I think so too.  Do you watch old western movies?  Apparently the bowler cap is the most popular, but the cowboy hat is the old cowboy hat.
I guess they are kind of like a forest ranger hat, peaked or brimmed, protective, kind of a forest Ranger hat, right?
I think I will have to check that out,  I'll have to look them up later.  Apparently,  in 2006,  the US passed a law to limit their length.  They were worried that people would use them as weapons lol.  I wonder what females wear with them?  Maybe a hairpin or something.  Maybe they are worried that the females wear them asWeapons LOL
haha I do, I have a weapon hairpin haha that is a pretty cool thing to have in a hat, another cool thing is a PhD in Finland has a sword that is actually a weapon and a hat haha
Wow that's cool! That's pretty cool. I would like to give that to you haha. Do you ever tip your hat? Apparently that started with knights and they would tip their face visors so you could not tip your hats with your face visORS, and apparently that started in the 1500s, I would have to give it a try haha
That's interesting. Back to wearing all sorts of hats! I like the height of bowler hats, too. Did you know that the London black cabs design originally was originally made to accommodate the height and height ofBowler hats?
I agree with you there. People definitely do not wear those hats these days haha. I think it was started in the 1920s. Apparently the conical dunce cap was started to wear at a party to encourage foolish behavior by people. I would not want to wear one of those hats! It would be like a dunce's cap, apparently the conically shaped ones encourage foolish Behavior haha
I have never wear a dunce cap. Fortunately, we have protective hats now. We make hard hats from the plastic made from the legos, and we can make hard hat from the Legos.
I agree.  I wonder if the miters hats worn by bishops and turbans like the ones Sikhs wear for their religious functions are the same one?
I guess chefs hats keep hair in them because of their symbolic meaning of the food they use.
Interesting, I didn't know that, I like soccer players, they wear hats lol, did you watch the FIFA World Cup this year?
No not really, but I know that 86 percent of the world watches it, which is more than other sports.
I agree.  I like soccer LOL.  But I don't know about you but for me sports are all about country, or country for that matter for thatmatter.  It's interesting to know though that the US has a net economic gain to hosting the world cup or the olympics.  There is no net economic loss and the US actually has a gain to hosts the worldcup.
I know qatar wanted the world cup to be solar powered and they promised air conditioned stadiums that would reduce the temperature by 20 celsius so that would help, they wanted the World Cup to be in 2020 and they want it to be 100% solar powered. That would definitely help reduce theTemperature!
Oh wow interesting. The city that will host the 2022 fifa cup hasn't been built yet apparently, it's coming up fast lol, the 2022 FIFA cup is in 2022.
Interesting! I wonder who the bid was for the 2022 bid?
They are good at soccer, but they are hungry for their first world cup finals since that defeat, and they are very good at it.
Hilarious, did you know that politicians in Britain used to wear a top hat to the house of commons?
Interesting, that seems the opposite of what is expected in America.  It is considered rude to not wearing hats inside, but wearing hats outside is considered rudderless.
America is funny like that.  They passed a law a few years ago limiting the length of hatpins in our hats.  I wonder if that was a weapon or something.  The US passed a Law about 100 years ago limits the length in hats.
I always thought that's silly customs, but I also thought that silly thing with the mortarboard we wear for graduation is just as silly as the hats and the mortarboards we wear on the mortar board.
I read that conical party hats were derived from dunce caps.
Oh I was not aware of that. I also didn't know that the cowboy hat was not popular in the old west. I think it was the bowler hat which was more popular.
No, I didn't know that, that's crazy, I've seen movies where they say it is the bowler hat, but that would be cool to see in the movies.
I guess hats have different functions.  For protection from weather, for religious reasons, for various kinds of news, and for other kinds for other functions I don't really put much thought into what's fashionable.
Yea, knights wore hats and helmets to protect themselves in battle.
I guess a helmet is also considered a type of hat. I never thought of them protecting themselves with hats. I do know that royal canadian police wear their own hats. TheRoyal canadian Police wear the goofiest hats ever.
I think they need them for the sun, eyes or rain, or both.
haha that is true, but it's sunny in Canada and I am covered in snow all the time so I assumed it would be sunny here, but I would be right haha.
I think they play a lot of hockey there, goals are scored by a player it's called a hat trick if a player has a hat tricks, I wonder how many goals are score, do they play that often?
Yes, I saw that movie about it in a movie a few days ago.  I like how back in the old days, hundreds of years ago, people wore hats.  It was a status symbol of sorts for rich people, and back then, rich people were the ones to wear hats. I think it was England and people wore Hats as a symbol of their status.
Yea I think rich people used to tip their hats which started from medieval knights, they would tip their heads which started in the 1500's
It is an interesting origin, I wonder if people still tip their hats or just a custom, or is it a custom now?
I don't but that is funny!
I think I've seen that in movies.  I wonder if any of the chefs in those movies are the only chefs that have ever seen a chef actually wearing a hat while cooking?  I think everyone wears hats!
I don't think so either. I wonder why baseball players wear hats?
True, they serve a function with baseball caps, but baseball players are so popular these days, they can serve afunction with anything.
True. Well it was nice talking to you. I'm gonna head to the mall for a hat now.  I'll be looking for a new hat.
Hello there, do you like to wear hats?
I do, I wear a hat for the sun and weather, protection from the sun.
Nice.  In 1998, British politicians in order to make a point in the house of commons had to wear a top hat if they were to be in the House of Commons.
I did not know that! I thought they wore a wig! Funny! Another style of hats used by chefs is the called the Toque. I wonder why that is? I thought it was just a style of hat that chefs wore.
I guess it's sort of like a cowboy hat to wear?  Apparently, in the old west, the most popular hat to wore was the bowler, I guess.  Not the cowboy hat, the bowLER.
For sure, don't forget the styles that Catholic bishops wear!  Like Sikh turbans.
Yup. Do you know where the whole thing about tipping the hat originated from?
It got its start in 1805!  I think it's funny that London cabs had to design it to accomodate hats in the design to help them start.
That is good.  I think it was knights back in the day who raised their visors to show friendliness to the knights back then.
Oh, that makes sense.  In Finland you can get a PhD if you have a top hat and a sword.  Or a degree in a top hats, and a PhD, that is, if you get one.
That sounds so royal! I wonder if it would be nice. Switching topics, do you watch soccer?
I try to watch the world cup, and some other championships. I try to follow it day to day.
Nice, where is it taking place?
Yes that is in Qatar, it must be crazy hot there, I did not know Japan made a bid to do it too.
Yeah, but the city that is the name of the place does not exist yet.  I wonder if it has a building or something in the city.
That's pretty crazy.  Maybe they are trying to raise some money.  I wonder how much of the global population watch the world cup though.
I understand but I wonder if the host countries are ever going to make any money from it.
It was a tie in the group that ended up being resolved with a 3-3 tie.
Wow that is complicated.  I wonder who was playing in it. The women's team is the best.
The womens team did well, New Zealand did great, they went undefeated.
That is pretty cool. Do you have a favorite soccer player?
I do not have one. I do know that Cristiano Ronaldo is the player of the world
Well I got to go, nice chatting with you
Hi there, did you know that the Lion King was the first disney film dubbed into Zulu?
I have watched the Lion King several times. I like the song by Elton John.
I have not seen it either. I heard Frozen is a female directed Disney movie. It has a lot of good songs in it. I think it is the only female directed disney movie.
I liked Frozen, I wanted to see it for commercials!
Me too. I think they originally started production in 2012.
I have and I enjoyed it. I liked the first part and the end, but not the second.
I have not seen that one, but it has great reviews. I like Disney movies. I wonder how much of the toy industry go involved with the production. I know the toy company owns most of the Disney movies, so maybe they want to help.
I'm not sure, but Star Wars is the highest grossing film of all time.
I didn't know that. Do you like the sequels? I liked the original 1977 movie better than the sequels, though.
I think the original one, it was more positive.
Yea, that is my favorite. It's crazy the entire Star Wars franchise is worth $65 billion, that's crazy
wow, I remember when it first came out, it was such a popular and high rated movie that brought in millions, it's the first movie that bringing in millions!
 Marcia Lucas took George's original scripts and made the movies with her own scripts. She did a great job making the movies.
I'm not familiar with Marcia Lucas.  George Lucas was the one who did that?
I wonder if star wars is doing well now. I wonder how much money she made since George took over the licensing and merchandising rights for star wars.
I would imagine she did, but I'm not sure. I also didn't know Disney recycled a lot of the animation frames for the first one, I think it was 50% of all animation frames.
I guess reusing frames would save disney time, and also save money?
I agree.  In Return of the Jedi the film had a return to the old way of doing it.
Yea, I did. I found some parts boring but the ending to Return of the Jedi was good.
I like the movie. I didn't get time to read the book though. I think it's king of odd. I don't know why they didn't take the time to reading it.
I have never read the book.  I have seen the movie.  It was nice talking with you.
Are you a Star Wars fan?
I sure am. I like the original trilogy the best, the second one is the best.
I did too, good! George Lucas is a billionaire now, he became a billionaire from it!
Yeah, he was clever, he knew what he was doing. He traded up on merchandising rights and traded in the rights for a huge bonanza. He got cash for nothing but knew what to do with it.
He sold it to Disney?  I wonder how much they sold for?  Probably not too much money lol
I dont think he got the money for $50M.  He probably needed to move on and get more.  I think it was good for him though,  billions!  I dont think they have enough money now.
I wonder if he has enough money to just sit on an island and enjoy it.  He could sit and watch movies with his wife.  His wife won awards so he could be with her.
His wife was in every film he was in. She had great ideas and great editing. She was very real in the film. She has great ideas  and great ideas.
I wonder if she won an academy award for her editing?
Yeah!  I bet George had mixed feelings about that Oscar, he was right there in the billions to get it!  Bet George had Mixed feelings about the $500,000 Oscar!
Yikes, that would give me mixed feelings lol.  I would like to hear what James Earl Jones said about voicing the "vader" in "valkyrie"  It's the only one that made me want to see it.  Did you hear what he was voicing?
I dont think he got paid a lot, maybe royalties or something, I think he was paid a little more for royalties.
 royalties added up to about 300,000 dollars, I believe.
Yeah, it is a ton.  Do you like drama in the movies?  I think drama is the key to most of the movies.
I agree lol, speaking of space movies I like guardians of the galaxy, have you seen that? I like that movies are about guardians of our galaxy
I did not see it. I heard good things though.  I think it was funny.
I think it was good. I think it is a type of marvel movie. It was great.
I like the comedy, but I do not like all the explosions and fight scenes.
Good point.  Well I got to go, nice chatting with you.
Yeah, I enjoyed chatting!  Yeah, same here!  Have a good day!
Enjoy your day!  Thank you as well!
I find it fascinating that the hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. Have you heard of that?
Interesting.  I have never heard about that.  How did they do that?
I recently learned about birds.  I also recently learned that birds bones are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than their multiple feathers and the entire skeleton is only 5lbs.
wow, I never knew that either.  I did know that crows can mimic humans, I wonder how they do that.
Speaking of which, I thought parrots could do that, but not crows.  I think I've seen wild birds in Australia that can mimc other things.  They mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws.  Speaking of which I think we can mimic the sounds of chainsaws as well.
That is crazy. Nature is amazing, isn't it?
I want to check out those birds that fly from Alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating.  There are birds that flying from Alaska  to northern Mexico without sleeping.
I don't either.  I would think they need lots more rest than that.
On the subject of birds, I recently learned that only extinct moa and elephant birds have wings. I know it seems strange that they would be considered birds but I have only recently learned about this. I wonder if the extinct moA and elephant bird are still considered birds.
That is strange! How do you classify them if they do not have wings? I like bird watching but I'm not sure.
I am not a huge fan, but I do bird watch from time to time. Do you?
No not really, I do like to watch TV though, I plan on watching the oscars, what about you?
I do plan on watching them, I hope it is hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.
I remember the day I had the first viewing party and that was it... I didn't see it...
I will, what would the viewing party consist of? what do you watch?
Lots of food usuallly a theme and other movies, and people to watch, and lots of food.
That sounds like tons of fun! I wasn't aware that the Academy Awards are also known as the Oscars. I just read about it a few days ago and was not aware of that.
I was not either! They should stick to just the movies that get best picture!
No I have not seen any of the movies that are up for best picture.  Which one is your best picture?
I think it's "Dunkirk" and "Lady Bird".  The Phantom Thread was the first to post the "post it" billboards outside ebbing and flowing in the shape of water.  I think they call it the lady bird because it's inMissouri.  Did you know that?
That's awesome, I can't wait for our viewing party I hope it turns out to be awesome, we are having a viewing party we will have a good time watching them all, have a great day!
Thank you! You too!
Thanks! You too! :)
Do you think you would host an Oscar party?
I don't but I do like the recipes for the recipes. I would not like to be the nominee for best picture.
I have heard that, deviled Eggs in the shape of water, I wonder how that came about.
That's good, but it seems odd that some places make spaghetti and meatballs as party food, but not sure how good it is.
I know right, it's messy to eat.  I would rather have a hard cider rarebit for dunkirk instead.  No ruined clothing,  just a hard apple cider rarebits for dunkin'.
I was thinking of a cheese board, but I don't have the speed.
It would seem that a martini would be more my thing too, I don't mind Winston Churchill's favorite drink, a martinis.
I'm not sure he was very good at it, but he would probably do good at the Oscar parties where they call them tartines, toast bites. I think that's how they make them sound impressive.
Did you know Walt Disney holds the record for the most oscars at 24 osc Oscars.
I think he won for snow white?
I was surprised to learn that Tom Hanks refuses to play bad guys in films.
I kinda think playing a bad guy can be fun and can be good. He's made many films that were not good. I don't think he's my fav, but he has made many good ones.
I cant recall the title but I think Captain Phillips.  He cast himself in a desert kingdom to sell technology.  Man, that would be something!  He and Captain Phillips are in the desert kingdom.  I like the cast.
I love the rom coms, sleepless in seattle, did you get it in the mail?
I am crazy about cloud atlas though, he is so crazy about Cloud atlas that he ends his emails with a pun!
I think he always does. I don't know if he is making movies, but his emails are so crazy that he needs to keep making movies to keep up with the emails!
He made a movie about the bird in it, but it is not his prominent feature. I think he has already made a movies about a bird.
I wonder if he used birds to make it, maybe Ravens, or maybe he had to fight them to get the bird.
No I didn't. hummingbirds use spider webs to construct their nests.
Interesting!  Pigeons produce mile-long "young" for their young.  They are birds that are not considered mammals.
I didn't know that. It was great chatting with you!
Good morning! How are you today?
Good! How are you? Tom Hanks is ok, he refuses to play bad guy roles.
I do like Tom Hanks!  It would be hard for me to see him as a bad guy, I think he's really good.  What was your favorite movie you ever saw him in?
Hmmm  Im unsure, I liked saving Mr Banks, he played a good walt disney.  apparently he was the first actor to be in a mainstream movie,  he probably did that the other day.  hes an actor that has done well, he has done good wALT Disney.  I think he was in Saving Mr Banks.
Wow, did you know that his film earnings were over $700K just from film earnings?
I totally believe it! Hes the highest all time box office star and at $8.5 billion. He seems pretty wholesome and loveable, too.
That's pretty amazing! I think he was able to do that while staying wholesome given today's sex, nudity and violence in films. $32 billion is still pretty amazing for staying wholesOME given today.
Hes so nice. He refunded an unhappy couples movie tickets because he didnt like Thomas Crowne.
That is really nice of him. Do you know who holds the record for most Oscars?
Isnt it someone in the same league as Tom lol, I know Eminem has oscars, isnt he? he is in the league as tom lol
True. Did you know that the dodo bird is related to the pigeon?
I did not know that! I dont know how those birds fly from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping, they can complain about lack of sleep again,lol. I wonder how some birds fly that far?
I agree, talk about some serious jet lag! Hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct their nests, I wonder why?
I did not know that.  Did you know that birds bones are so hollow that they are able to have feathers?  I wonder if that is why birds bones can be so hollow?
I guess that is why most people think that they fly.  Did you know that birds developed from dinosaurs and that people used to fly before that?
i do not believe that.
I like to picture some birds today as they used to, miniature dinosaurs, but I can't picture some of them today
Yes weve seen them portrayed in movies.There are wild birds in australia that can mimic sounds like cameras, car alarms, and car alarms.
Thats amazing. I knew that I owned a bird that could imitate his dishwasher.
lol, i wonder how it did that?  How did it unload and load the dishwasher.  How do you unload AND load thewasher?
Nice. I think it can too.
Good talk to you! :)
do you know tom hanks is an actor?
I love Tom Hanks as an actor and as a comedian.  He's a good guy who refuses to play bad guy roles in films because he is not a bad guy.  I don't know why he wouldn't play bad roles in movies.
Tom Hanks is one of my favorites as well. Apparently, he is the first to end his emails with a pun.
Cool!  A couple went to the cinema and the tickets were a disappointment for Larry Crowne and he expressed that to Tom Hanks.  Tom H tanks personally refunded the price of the tickets to the couple.
That is nice of him.  Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star.  He is the second highest all the time box officestar.
Yes, the man has over 8.5 billion world wide firm earnings.
That is amazing, he is a good actor too!
I did too.  He was in Saving Mr. Banks too. Tom Hanks was the first actor to play Walt Disney in a mainstream film.  I wonder if he will be the last actor to Play Walt Disney?
He is very talented. He also voices Sheriff Woody in the Toy Story film series.
I really loved Big.  I still like him in the newer movies.  Did you see the new Apollo 13 one?  I didn't get it in the mail until after I saw the old ones, but I did catch some of the old cast, sleepless in Seattle (1962) and Sleepless in Washington (1975).
I love You've Got Mail. Have you ever watch that movie?
I loved him in Saving Mr. Banks. You ever watch " the green mile"? I loved that one. Did you ever watch the one with the splash with Daryl Hannah?
Are you familiar with academy awards? AKA the Oscars?
Yes. I remember back in the day when the Oscars were just a few years old. I can't believe Blazing Saddles was nominated for 3 Oscars. I don't think I have seen it.
The Oscars is a awards to talented people in the film industry annually. They give out the awards to talent in the movie industry annually
Daniel Day-Lewis is the only actor to win best actor at the Oscars 3 times and the only Actor to win Best Actor 3 times in the Oscars.
Thanks for the info!  I like to know facts related to the entertainment industry.  Do you know of any facts related
I did not know that Walt Disney to this day holds the record for most oscars won by a man with 22 oscARS won by one man.
Wow that is amazing! The Oscars were nominated for 9 emmys too!
That's a lot. Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo Dicaprio, Johnny Depp, Will Smith, Will/Willy Smith, George Lucas, and Bill Murray combined.
I was surprised to hear about Eminem getting oscars awards more for his songs than Leonardo and Johnny Depp. I thought there would have to be more Oscars awards than Leonardo for his language in his songs.  I'm surprised to see how many Oscar people don't know who he is or think he's Eminem.
I thought so too. It was nice chatting with you, have a good one.
Do you like movies?  I do.
Yea, I do. I like the Lion King, did you know that it was the first Disney movie to be dubbed in Zulu and it was in the Lion king!
That is great! I'm glad they did that, why didnt they make a live action version?
Yes they were suppose to make one but they didn't. Wreck-it Ralph started development a little way back in the 70s, I believe.
That is amazing! I guess the arcade games that were used in the movie date back in the 70s and 80s, that makes sense.
Yea, the toy industry had a large influence on Disney movies and it's a shame about the toy company and its influence on disney movies.
Yes, the films become giant commercial for the product.  If fast food is involved in a toy sales campaign, they're squeezed for every dollar.  The toy sales are squeezed for the dollar.
Yea, it is. Film makers reuse animation frames so much now.
Yes I bet that is to reduce costs. Animation is really expensive and very intense so they want to reduce the costs of the good stuff. I bet it takes more than 24 hours to make one of those beautiful films but with computers they could do it in just 2-3 hours. It must be very expensive, but good stuff too!
Even with computers, I bet wreck it ralph was originally hand drawn, its a shame they went with computers.
I dont watch a lot of animation but I know that hand drawn is a style that is very interested in the story, I dont watch it often, I like the style myself but I dont like the look of a lot and I dont really watch a LOT of animation.
Yea, I like the Star Wars movies released from 1977-1983
I dont like the graphics, cgi cant save them, if it supports a story is weak then the graphics will be behind it.
Yea plus Marcia Lucas really made the story of the original trilogy better
She had a good understanding of the story, and she could shape his ideas into the way things were done. George needs guidance, but he is creative in his own way, so he can shape his own things.
Yea, I think he stopped caring after making billions off the licensing and merchandise from Star Wars
Maybe so, but he got an Oscar and a billions and will suffer the rest of his life for it. I wonder what he'll do with those billions if he does get an Oscar?
Yea, James Gunn did a good job writing the screenplay for those movies.  I liked watching him in guardians of the galaxy, I liked that movie, James Gunn did a really good job watching it.
I havent seen it yet, I dont watch those films, but I know its based ona comic book, its been a great chat, I really like it, I also dont watch the TV, but its been great chat.
Yea, I like how China is trying to catch Guardians of the Galaxy, an interplanetary unusual attack team from the galaxy
lol That would be interesting to see!  Have a good evening!
Thanks! You too!  Have a great one!
hey there my friend do you wear shoes?
Yes, I do!  I know ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.
That is shocking. I used to date a ballet dancer, she was really serious, I can confirm that. She had feet problems, she had feet Problems!
I can imagine. They also put dry tea bags in their shoes to absorb any odors. I've heard that works.
I would have to put some in my smelly feet too. I think I would put them in my memory banks for later haha.
Did you know that Nike has actually found 5000 year old shoes that perform better than modern shoes?
Wow I wonder if they are? Stephon Marbury helped to promote a line of shoes that are pet names and I would love to see those!
Yep, I did know that!  I was bugged that during a G20 summit, Russia gave delegates thumb drives during a meeting.  Did you see that?
That's crazy! That doesn't surprise me. Russia is always trying to get some dough out of everyone.  It's strange how they do that.  I guess they did that at the Geneva Summit last year as well.  That didn't surprise them.  They began using trojan viruses at the G20 too.  Crazy.
Yeah and Spain is the only country that has been a permanent guest at every g20 summit but only one country that was a permanent Guest at every summit
That is weird! I heard they have to request official membership for every game eve online, I wonder how they do that.
Dunno but I feel like you're guaranteed member if you do, so I feel you're a guaranteed member. I have not.
I guess they apparently have world summits, they even received the world summit award from the united nations in 2010, and it was for an online computer game.
When it is your turn, Japan gets a silver cup.  I wonder if it sends you a silver Cup when you turn 100
No I didn't know that, that's really cool and very nice of the prime minister, I would find that really nice even if I were turning 100, but I wonder if they had to make a cheaper cup haha, like if more people were turning that old, they'd probably make a better cup haha
Yep. A radio station successfully prank called Queen Elizabeth II. They should have fired them.
Awesome!  I love the UK prime minister's cat, he has the government title Chief Mouser, which he uses for his cabinet office.  I wonder what a cat would think of that?  I would think the government's title Chief Mouser would be awesome!
I think in Australia position like that one would have more job security since the constitution doesn't exist and a pampered feline can just exist in the constitution.
That's screwy!  On a different note, have you heard of the actress Helena Bonham Carter?  She was in the Harry Potter movies.  I didn't know she was the actress helena bonham carter.
I have, she is the great-granddaughter of JK.
Yep, that's wild! I like the prime Minister idea better than the president/president idea though. I feel better about the president than the american one haha.
Nancy Pelosi's stilettos were in fashion during the coverage on MSNBC.
That's an odd thing to cover.  It must be tough to give a 3 hour speech and have to look tough.
It's funny how high heels can help with political rhetoric, like Ann Richards commenting on Ginger Rogers.  She said, "It's like Fred Astaire and the high heels."  I think that's funny.
It is kind of interesting that she did that, I wonder if it was a power move or something?
Yea, I guess the Ferragamo Vara pump was a very popular shoe for politicians, it was the most popular shoe
Yeah it sounds like it.  Some people call those high-heeled shoes postmenopausal Mary Jane's, I wonder why?
Apparently they're for feet that are not in use, but in Britain they cared what Theresa May wears because they were in a place obsessed with politician shoes.
Kind of interesting.  First lady Melania Trump has been marked down by Barbie for wearing shoes 3.7 inch high heels that were marked down to $15.00.  I think it was because she boarded a plane in the Air Force, which is a disaster for the Air force, and wore heels 3.9 inch high!  Kind of like Melania Trump.
Yea even people who don't mind their business didn't mind the issue when Michelle Obama wore lanvin cap-toe sneakers to a food bank and it wasn't an issue whenMichelle Obama wore Lanvin cap-'toe sneakers when she went to the food bank
I agree.  Do you know how to tie your shoes?
I had no clue. I did know that if you put dry tea bags in your shoes to absorb oder you can put dry Tea bags in them.
Good to know.bill nye the science guy holds a patent for ballet pointe shoes
I wonder if he gets to make a lot of money since professional ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week, they must make a LOT of money
There are wizard of Oz inspired shoes that can guide you home with a gps system.  You can click your heels together and they will guide youhome.  I wonder if they have a GPS system?
That is pretty cool, I bet the shoes Stephon Marbury promotes them, I wonder how much they sell, I know the gps helps, and I bet they are better than the shoes Steph Marbury promoted
Yeah, nowadays, shoes cost so much.  Queen Elizabeth II employs someone to wear her shoes to ensure they're comfortable.  That is nice of her to do.  I think she likes to wear them to ensure she's comfortable, but it is nice to know that she is not the only one to do it.  Some shoes cost $200 or more!
Yea, it is odd though that a Prime Minister's cat has the official title of chief mouser to the cabinet office, I wonder if it has the same official title as the prime minister's cat that has the Cabinet office
That is funny and odd.  A radio station successfully did a prank on the minister of Canada by pretending to be called Queen Elizabeth II.  The radio station  successfully called Queen elizabeth "the prim minister of canada," pretending to look like her.
That is pretty funny, did the prime minister ever give out gifts like Japan do?
The UK Prime Minister is a person to look out for, Andrew Bonar Law, not sure.  Anyway, great talking with you today.
Nice chatting with you as well!
Hi, how are you?
Hi aliright, I do have interest in shoe styles, shoe designs have varied throughout human history and our designs have different from each other.
I do. My wife is more involved in style than I am. I do not have the money for style so I do get involved in it.
Yea, a lot of people are obsessed with it. I don't care. Nancy Pelosi wore 5.7 inch stilettos when she made her speech. She said they were comfortable and she was not uncomfortable, so she wore them during her speech!
I think that fashion is very powerfull.  If I was Male, I would worry about my size because I am small and wanted to be bigger, or if I were male, I'd be too powerfull for my own size.
I guess a Ferragamo vara pump might be her fashion choice.  It's a fashion choice most working class women use to make statements, like Ann Richards.  Some people want to make a statement and I guess a Ferrari pump is a way for women to do so.
That must be expensive!  I wonder if it's as expensive as $100,000 for four pairs of ballet shoes a week.
I had no idea.  From a man's point of view, I guess a lot of women see Ferragamo's vara pumps as lower end shoes.  I guess from a man't point of point of views, I would see those as higher end shoes too!
Did you know that 5000 year old shoes are better than the ones that perform better than 5000 year olds?
I wonder if the 5000 year old basic sandal with a thin sole lasted longer than Ann Richards pumps or Condoleezza Rice's knee high Boots?  A thin sole lasts longer than ann richards pumps or condoleezezza's rice knee high boots?
I wonder if the military thought it was ok to dress them up?  Did you know Freeze Frame Matrix jump out of the freeze frame matrix jump out at you?
lol I wonder that too.  Some people were upset with Michelle Obama for wearing a pair of sneakers to a food bank.  She did it because she liked to go to the food bank
I'm always bugged when people do stuff like that.  I mean, I know normal people do it, but I get upset when the haters can't afford it, or they can't even afford a small part of it.  If she had enough wealth to do that, then she should be able to do what normal people can do, and not be upset about something like sneakers.
lol, yea I know right!  I wonder what her $540 shoes were worth now?  I know that Lanvin cap-toe suede sneakers looked really nice but the fact that they were $540 is still $50 lol.
Me either. But I found Steve Smith leaving his shoes on the field in a rememberance to homeless without shoes was a nice gesture.
Yea, Steve Smith is a pretty stand up guy, he's one of the best QB's on his teams, he was leaving his own cleats on the field to play on, that's a prettyStand Up guy gesture for homelessness, too bad most people like him don't get to play, I think that's why they are leaving their cleats for other teams
Did you know you can put tea bags in the gym shoes?  I have tried that before and it works to absorb odor.  I wonder how it works.
Maybe a tea bags in the shoe could absorb odor,  if the type of tea works,  lol  I wonder if a tea bag in the same shoe couldabsor
I like Earl Grey. I use it at home and it helps.
Sounds good.  I have cheap green tea bags at home.  They can get rid of shoe odor.
Nice chatting with you.  Thanks!
I love buying shoes, but I feel that shoe quality is decreasing.  Do you feel that way?
I do too! I have never tried any of the shoes.
Apparently there was a 5000 year old pair of shoes that performed better than their modern counterparts.
That makes sense. I bet they didn't have to buy replacements.  I don't have any shoes that last my lifetime.  That is if you don't buy replacements, lol.
NBA player Stephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes retailed at $15.95.
I guess he wanted to make them look cheap.  $15 seems a bit low.
That explains it, he didn't accept any promo money so he could do what he wants.
Makes sense. I guess the shoes didn't take long to get old, so it was worth the money. I don't know, but I guess so.
Yeah good point.  Steve smith, a football player once left his cleats on the field after the field to raise awareness for the homeless people who have no left over cleats.
That was a great gesture.  I think more athletes need to do things like that.  We need more athletes like that in our society.
I think so too!  I follow what is going on in the UK with Brexit, the Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the residence of her residence, Downing Street, is at 14 Downing Street.  I wonder what they are doing about Brexit.
She has a difficult task in front of her with the whole Brexit thing is supposed to have no effect on the UK in any way, so she's not going to be able to get anything done in short order. I think that the whole thing is going to have a short lasting effect.
Yeah it sounds very clustered and confusing. It's going to mess up everything. The Prime minister in Australia has a position because of the constitution. That's an odd fact about the Prime Minister.
That is strange.  I guess I never knew that was how it worked.  It is a different system than the US.  Who knew?
I suppose so, did you know that in Japan when you turn 100 the prime minister sends you a silver cup to celebrate.  It's full of alcohol when you do so.
I would want a fine Japanese sake, for sure!  I think that they should rethink giving out cups though, a lot of people live to be 100 so maybe they should have a lot more of that fine Japanese  sake, I know a lot Of people live up to 100 there.
I wonder if the red solo party cups are the cheaper cups?  Or if they are the red red soloParty cups? haha
lol I guess so! They could prank the Japanese prime minister into giving out cups to everyone!
Haha, that would work! The actress who played Bellatrix in Harry potter is a descendant of the prime minister.
I dont know if there are many actors for harry potter. bellatrix?
I think Helena Bonham Carter is the actual name, she's a good actress.  Nice talking with you today, I have to go, bye.
HBC is a great actress as well, she is pretty and a great Actress, have a great weekend, thanks.
You too, stay safe bye!
Hi, do you like star wars?
I love Star Wars!  20th Century Fox gave George Lucas $500,000 to help him out.
That is pretty cool. is it your favorite?
Sith: Revenge of the Sith is my favorite. You?
I like Return of the Jedi.
Did you know Star Wars hold the Guinness World Records title for "Most Favorite Character in a Franchise".  Darth Maul was my favorite character.  I think he should have a Guinness World Record title!
Lol no, I didn't know that. They're opening a Star Wars land in Disneyland in 2019, which is only two years after the first one came out. That seems completely believable LOL.
Wow, I didn't know that. I plan on visiting Star Wars land once it opens.  The Star Wars saga is told over the course of a hundred years after Return of the Jedi opens and the first hundred years are told in Star Wars, so it's definitely not a new one.
Absolutely,  hell yeah,  I can't wait!  I would ride the whole ride if I couldnt just go in and wait.  Did you know that Pacino turned down the role of Han solo because he couldn't understand the script LOL?  Pacino was right,  he could have been right for the role and he did well in the role!
Can you imagine being on a death star or riding a millennium falcon, I can imagine that would be fun.
I can't believe that James earl ones spent only 2.5 hours recording Darth Vaders lines lol he made $300K lol
haha I did not know that. I did know that Bill Murray auditioned for the role of Han Solo haha and they did not take him, I wonder how many things were going on at the time, I did also not know Bill Murray was going to take the role for the last time, he would be doing han solo haha
I dont think he would have been a good fit for it.  I dont know if he would do well or not.
Bill Murray is a party animal and a partyAnimal.  He's better as a pilot.  Han solo is a little more of a party bird.
Do you like Disney? I do
I like Disney a lot, I was a huge fan when I was younger, what about you?
I learned Frozen was the first animated Disney movie directed by a woman.
That is pretty interesting.  I saw the movie and it took millino ballons to lift carl's house in that movie
That is an insane amount of balloons!
Eventually they will eventually.  One of my favorites, Jungle Book, was about vultures hair!  The beatles did the best with vulture's hair.
I liked Aladdin, it was a good movie, Mermaid was good too,
Yea, Hercules is my favorite of the three
I dont know much about that one, but I like it. Well it was good talking to you!
Hello, do you like star wars?
I love star wars!  How about you?
I am also a big fan of Star Wars movies, my favorite is the old ones.
Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, I like it, it was really good!
I like Clone Wars.  I like that episode, but a lot of the others.  Did you know there is only one Clone Wars that has never been seen before?
That's good!  20th Century Fox thought Star Wars was going to flop, but it did well.  Can you imagine how much money they could have made in total with how many movies they could've made.  Crazy that 20th century fox thought Star wars was going be a flop.  Imagine all of the money they would have made!
I can imagine that's a lot, considereing the amount of fans the franchise has, there is also a movie that got dubbed in Navajo, I can't imagine how much it would have to be.
That's awesome, I never thought that was possible, did you know that Star Wars holds the world record for most films made with over 750 films made, including 3 billion including a guiness world record $8.5 billion for the merchandise franchise. It is so successful they even have a merchandise franchise!
I didnt know that, thas a lot of money for a franchise, it was estimated at over 8 billion dollars, I didnt know the franchise was that old, thats a lot, I wonder how old the first 3 are now, its already over 10 billion dollars
Wow, that's crazy insane! I can't believe Pacino turned down the role of Han Solo in the first Star Wars story, because he couldn't understand the script.
I did not see that! That is crazy, he missed out on such a big role, and he changed his carreer for a big Role!
It would have been really bad I guess lol they were thinking of casting Christopher Walken for the part, they should have just kept thinking of Casting Christopher Walkon
I wonder if he was a Tie Fighter pilot, I think he would have been good Han Solo is a good Han.  I do like the hole story behind Solo, what is the holeStory behind Solo?
That's true. I think Solo is the first Star Wars story to be told in Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, not by Walt Disney Pictures motion pictures.
Yeah, I love Disney as well.  I like Star Wars too!  I think that Disney bought the franchise in 2013 when Disney bought The Lion King.  That is one of my favorites!
I love the Lion King too, and did you know that it was first dubbed into Zulu for its african release and it was the first Disney film to do so? Wow, that's pretty cool, and it's the first disney film to be dubbed into zulu.
I guess that answers part of my question as to why Disney is so popular, I guess the question is why not more? I still need to watch Frozen, did you watch it?
I did, Frozen is great, it's the first animated film to be directed by a woman for the first time and the first one to be done by a man and also the first ever to bedirected by a Woman
It's interesting that the toy industry gets involved with Disney to.  They seem to have a lot of money in their fimals to begin with, huh?  And the toyindustry gets involved, to begin?  That's interesting!
I guess the toy industry is a huge part of most Disney productions, I read somewhere that they own about 80% of Disney productions by now, pretty crazy.
That is pretty interesting that it is that big. Disney is considered by many to be Fim Studios. I guess that's why Disney is known as Disney.
Hi there!  Are you a star wars fan?
I absolutely love Star Wars, the American epic space opera franchise created by George Lucas.  It's an American epic.
James Earl Jones only spent 2.5 years recording all of Darth Vader's lines for the last movie - the timing was so perfect, that he got the perfect 24 hours of recording for all of his Darth Vader lines for that movie.
I wonder how much he made from those. Did you know that George Lucas only got paid 1.75million for the jedi and a few hundred thousand for the last one? The entire star wars saga is told by him over the course of 16 years after Return of the Jedi, made in 1977.
Interesting!  I am looking forward to the new film as well.  Originally Al Pacino turned down the role of Han Solo for the final installmant of the spinoffs because he didn't think he'd be any good in the role.  He was pretty right about Han Solo's solo story.  The spinoffs have been pretty good.
The Star Wars triology, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and The Last Jedi.  I loved all of them starting with the first one.
Did you like the Rogue One spinoff?
Rogue One: A Prequel trilogy was a prequel trilogy that was released in 2016 and had mixed reactions from both critics and fans, but it was very well done by critics andFans.
I thought Phantom Menace was good, and the storyline was good.  I thought the digitized characters were good, too.  A lot of people didn't like the prequel trilogies, but I think that is because they didn't do it right.  It was better than the first two, I think.
I think the Star Wars is a lot to live on.  The books, movies, books, tv shows, computer and video games, TV and games all have a theme and a lot of the same characters from the film series.  And the Star wars universe is the highest grossing in the computer and Video Games of all time.
Wow, its incredible the business, in 2017 the star wars franchise was estimated at over $65 billion dollars, that is a staggering 8.5 billion dollars!
Big wow for a media franchise!
Thats crazy numbers, right?  Did you know that star wars was dubbed in Navajo making it the first major film to be dubbed in a Native American language?
Awesome! Ewan McGregor's brother, Colin McGregor, is a British pilot and also a Star War actor.  His call-sign is "Obi-Wan" which is the last call- sign of a British Pilot.  I wonder if that was his last name.  Is Colin McGregor's name Ewan?
Wow, that is fascinating, I never knew that, I think that is very neat and I think it is really neat.
Did you know that James Cameron decided to quit his truck driving job to enter the film industry after watching Star Wars?
Good career move.  Talk about being on the road and not getting pay for it!  Marcia Lucas was the reason for the original movie and won an academy award for editing the film.  Did you know that?
Fun fact I just learned.  I loved Firefly.  Toys R Us had a toy Hans Solo that was in every firefly episode.  That was a fun fact.
I never knew that! I never knew there was. Did you ever watch it?
Bill Murray auditioned for the role of Hans Solo in the pilot and was only given the role because he did not have the bridge console, but Bill Murray auditioning for the roles of the Bridge console.
Wow, I never knew that. I wonder if it worked out for him. Well, I'm running out of here. It was nice chatting with you. Some funny comments that Solo makes.
How can Star Wars movies be culturally relevant 40 years after being first come out a long time ago?
It's possible, but I think the fans will be the same. The movies that were remade in 2013 were remades in the UK so there are fans that will see them one day. I think they will like the saga.
Lucas was going to plan to do it, but the Disney takeover had some problems and the new stories didn't go according to plan.  I wonder what the Disney Takeover will be like.
Yes, they should have bought the franchise when they were worth $65 billion, which was a lot of money when they bought it for $50 billion
That's a lot, I wonder if it was Lucas lucky or talented, he could have gotten $25 million.
Star Wars is great, it is a lot of money and he was, but his wife had a big influence on the franchise so I think Lucas is right, his wife has a lot, Star Wars has a big effect on everyone.
20th Century Fox thought it was going to be a dud. They did not want to secure the rights to licensing any merchandise. Lucas becomes billionaire because he can.
I heard somewhere that Lucas made the right decision. He didn't give the chance to forego his directors fee.
I guess so. I bet he was. Solo: A Star Wars Story is the last film that will follow the narrative previously established in the Star Wars story. What are the odds of that?
That is a valuable lesson!  Fox News is definitely coming out with a new Star Wars movie.  Who's your favorite Star Wars Movie?
I like Empire Strikes Back.  Han was the tie fighter pilot in that movie, but he did not want to go into the movie solo.
I thought the solo movie was good, but the Clone Wars was also great, Phantom Mennace was also good and I liked Clone Wars, but I thought the Solo movie was the best.
I like Rogue One the best.  It was kind of refreshing.  There is so much good sci-fi out there.  The plot is just crazy and there is so little plot.  That is kind of refreshment for me.
I didn't like it, but it was good.  Did you know that Star Wars holds a Guinness World record for most successgull film merchandising film?
I think Disney has to be hard to break that record, especially if the toy industry gets involved in the beginning of filming and the toy Industry gets involved with it before disney.
I wonder how much they get involved in Star Wars, it's such a franchise now
I know, I dont understand Wreck it Ralph though. It was in development that long, I just dont understand wreck it ralph took that long to get to development that far.
Disney must have faith in the franchise. I hear the video game is great, but I don't think the movies will do well. But then again, Disney does not have much faith in a video game.
I like the wreck it ralph game as well, but I haven't seen the movie.  I like the merchandise from the movie though.
Yeah its originally a game, the arcade game, did you watch the movie Frozen, the movie was an arcade game as well,
I have seen parts of Frozen, the olaff the snow man is funny.
Yeah Olaf is a funny name, cool fact but did you know that the very first animated Disney film directed by a woman was a disney movie.  It was great chatting with you I think I'm going to go watch a dis Disney movie now,  I think it is the last animated Disney movie I will watch,  have a great day!
Yep I am going to watch a few movies now, I don't have much time, thanks for your time.
Do you watch the academy awards?
I do not, I do not know much about the Oscars, do you?
I am surprised that out of the 22 oscars Eminem has won, only 2 have been Oscars, I wonder how many oscaries Eminem has winning?
I know, right? I also know Johnny Depp has more, as does Will Smith.
That is crazy, they are both good actors but those are the only two good ones!
Yes, but they do make questionable decisions sometimes. They are nominated for Emmys, Oscars and even Academy Awards and have been nominated for Emmy's!
I agree they can make questionable decisions, lol. Its interesting that Walt Disney still holds the record for most awards given at one award show, he did it in 1928.
I think Blazing Saddles was nominated for 3 Oscars.  It was a great comedy film.
that is a movie that is worth the watch, have you seen it? it is worth it
It is an amazing film and ahead of it's time.
I will have to watch it on Netflix later.
I don't know but you can easily see how you can find it online.
I had no idea that the money actors can make from their fan signings is just that much, it's how much money actors get
What does he make? I think he is right around the money I think I would make.
I bet.  They are still survive by surviving.
I wonder how much an Oscar victory shapes public opinion?
Honestly, I'm not really sure.  People don't seem to care as much as they used to.
That is true, but I think individual movie performance is a bigger indicator for that.
Yep, a lot of people don't include all actors who deserve to be nominated for awards anymore, like truy.  There are so many awards anymore that they don't even include all artists who deserve they have been nominated.
Yes.  It's intriguing that Eminem has so many oscar and Emmy nominations.
I agree. I wonder how many of the things he rapping about get nominated and win so many times he could get nominated but never nominated and winning?
Well, it's been wonderful talking to you!
Daniel day-lewis has won best actor three times. That's crazy!
I agree.  I wonder how many other movies he won for.
hmmm I am not sure, he won for Lincoln, but I think he also won forincoln in the blood, I haven't seen that movie I wonder if it is any good
I honestly have no idea about the first one honestly, I guess I will have to check it out, but I know Blazing Saddles was nominated 3 times, I have no Idea why, I never saw that movie
That's absolutely hilarious! I think it was a spoof on Western movies. I know Gene Wilder, the dude who played Willy Wonka, is pretty much the only western I've ever seen.
I love comedy and spoof movies! I don't like science fiction, but I know some of the actors make so much money on it. Do you know if they do autograph signings or do they do science fiction?
Yeah, science fiction is super common today, but it has not been mainstream for many years, I guess it wasn't even in the top 10 in the 1960s.  I think Stanley Kubrick is one of the top 3, and then Stanley Kubrick himself, so I'm not sure if science fiction was around before or after him, but yeah, science Fiction is super popular.
I agree.  There are a lot of people out of the closet science fiction fans, and I think that's because they aren't comfortable expressing themselves in ways they would be comfortable expressing in the events of the day and events back in their membership.  But a lot more people are now in the closet Science Fiction fans than in the life of a lot a lot back then.
Haha I don't think they should have that basis covered. John Williams was a popular science fiction science fiction author and also won Oscars for both composing the Star Wars music and the Picture of the Year and composing the star wars score for the film, both won Oscars.
I honestly don't know. I can't remember a science fiction film winning an Oscar before now, but the last time I can remember a Science Fiction film winning a Best Picture was in 2013 for "It". I think I saw a movie that won it that had no dramatic or dramatic end and it ended up with a best picture, I'm not sure how that ends.
Yeah, me either. What is your favorite sci-fi film?
I can't think off the top of my head of my favorite off the head, but I do enjoy a little bit of every sci fi movie that comes on tv.  I love movies dealing with aliens and the fear element.  It's why I think I enjoy it.
I like the outer space movies, like alien movies, but the fear element is usually huge in the marvel movies because of the fear aspect.
I enjoy them a lot but I do not like the storylines that they created. I think a lot of the series were just not created right.
Yeah. There is a lot that is super unbelievable in the Marvel universe. The recent Avengers: Infinity War was one of the best, but the recent Avengers 2 and 3 were super unbelievable too.
I did, it was awesome, so good I can't believe it came out in 2018.
Yeah, I think it was on netflix at the time I saw it but I don't think it's your typical superhero movie.  It's not very entertaining because it follows the hero's path, plot, and time, but it's not exactly a super hero path, but I think the plot is ok.
That is awesome, I will have to check that out on Netflix, thanks for the info. I think it's on Netflix now, thank you for the information.
No problem,  any recent movies you recommend?
Honestly, I don't really like hallmark Christmas movies. I'm a dork that watches those lol. How about you?
Haha I love the cheesy Christmas movies!
That's awesome!  lol  I don't know why I would ever want to see one though!
I def need to watch them this year, I'm in the holiday spirit right now so I need to!
It was great chatting tonight!  Thanks for the movie recommendation!
Hey how are you doing? Did you watch the Academy Awards this year?
I would love to watch the Academy Awards. I anticipate that they will be coming out in a couple of weeks, I think it is in early march so the next couple of days are the best weeks.  Do you watch the academy awards?
I believe it is in late Feb.  They give out the awards.
Very cool.  I heard Walt Disney has received 13 Oscar nominations and a statue of Snow White and the dwarves as a special Oscar.  That is a nice gesture.
I think I saw that somewhere. Blazing Saddles was also nominated for 3 Oscars.
Blazing Saddles was very good
Yeah it's good and really funny, it's not a politically correct thought though.
I was thinking of brokeback mountain, I remember liking the old sci fi movies, Blazing saddles, and thinking of Blazing Saddles.
I do like movies. I like the old stuff like robots, cyborgs and space travel. What about you?
I love sci fi movies. I love the movie Contact. I like that it has a sci fi element to it. I also love the film Men in Black, and also Gattaca. I really liked Starship Troopers too.
Oh wow, that was a landmark scifi movie!  That was a great year for movies, I think it was Kubrick back in 1997, he had a great YEAR for movies.
Yeah that was a really popular one.  It's crazy to think the sci fi industry started with "The Space Odyssey", then went on to Star Wars, then "The Last Space Odyssey" and then "Star Wars".  It was all about special effects and the special effects that were so popular.
Yes it was. It's cool that NASA named Gattaca the most accurate sci fi film ever.
Apparently the movie "Woman in the Moon" influenced Nasa so much. The "cliffhanger" for multistage orbital rockets is a similar way to a countdown.  It's a countdown from the launch pad to the moon.  G-force is a very accurate way to use it.  Maybe it has influenced NASA to do something similar with their "multistage" rockets.
I agree!  NASA is cool about this!  They have a list of space accurate terms for movies and that's on their list of Space accurate terms.
Yeah NASA is really cool, I would love to learn how to play it, I know I could play it but I'm really bad haha, maybe I'll try tennis next, I'd love to know how to do that, and yeah NASA is also really cool haha
I played in high school.
I like watching tennis sometimes.  I wonder if watching it is cheating.  Did you know grunting can give a tennis player more power during the swing?  Some professionals think it's cheating.
lol that is crazy the longest tennis game was 11 hours thats exhausting, that is so crazy!
Talk about exhausting!  I have only done it a few times myself and it's not that crazy.  The longest single point lasted 11 minutes as they kept hitting the ball back and forth.  Talk about exhausting.  And the longest singlepoint ever was 11 minutes and they had to try to hit the ball 17 times.
Wow thats nuts. The longest game was 11 hours and was played over 3 days, they never had a break! It took 4 days and 17 hours for the longest game!
Wow three days for a match?  I wonder how much stamina they have for that.
Mel Gibson is selling off his house with a goal of $50M, did you know that?
It is for only $60 million, and has an ocean view, must be nice,
Yes, the privacy piece is crucial. The swimming pools seem ideal.
Wow, that's sounding better.  Mad Max 3's "Mad Max: The Last Mad Max" has a Gibson in it.  He started his career in Australia and received his recognition there!
Yes, that was the case.  It took a fashion trend that took decades to catch on, like polo shirts, the guy who invented polo shirt was the same tennis guy who created them, but he didn't create them as a fashion Trend.
I think you could start by getting interested in acting. Did you know that after Gibson gained greater recognition in his role as a Detective, he became interested in Acting in the role of a Lethal Weapon.
Maybe I could go the acting route, but on the other side, I would go for the fan convention thing, if there is a fan convention.
That would be cool!  Gibson was trying to rebuild his on the property that was on fire, and they had to rebuild it from the fire.
I guess he was worried about protecting it. That explains the super-fortified and booby-trapped estate near Atlanta. I guess that was the downside of being a celebrity.
That would be scary!  The house sounds exciting.  There is a house with ocean views and a glass antique pocket doors that open to the inside.  It's in a canyon with 3-D ocean views.  And glass antiquepocket doors thatOpen to theInside.
Pretty much the same, standard windows that overlook a very busy road, pretty boring in comparison to the neighbor's house. I wonder if they have any European-imported elements, like the wooden flooring that has hand-hewn wood and other European-Imported elements instead of the standard flooring like on a busy road?
I wonder how much of that is green friendly. The house next to me has working solar panels to supplement the electrical supply.
He is pretty smart. Duchovny was responsible for many improvements to the grid. He was probably set up to be the best of a lot of uber-rich people.
I'm not sure. It could have been set up by someone else. Do you follow the Academy Awards for artistic and technical merit in film?
Sometimes I do. I tend to only watch a few films at a time, and this year there are a few big winners this march. I like Jimmy Kimmel, movies, and I think he's one of the big winnersThis March, so I think that will be a big one.
I don't know.  Walt Disney won a special Oscar for the Snow White.  He made a regular sized statuette for it and a miniature Oscars that was made from a snow white.  The statue is a regular Oscar sized statue.
I learned that from George Melies.  I guess he is right.  Walt Disney sure deserves a special Oscar.  The movie Hugo is a trip to the moon.  Did you watch it?  I liked it.  It was a trip.  Do you know the name of the movie Hugo?  It is about a man on a trip around the moon, I guess it was by Walt Disney.
I like Disney, but I didn't know that John Williams got 13 nominations for Oscars, he only has 2 for best actor, I didn's even know that Disney has had so many nominations for oscars
I was surprised by Eminem's success at the academy awards. I will be interested in watching them this year. It was nice talking to you.
I'm going to go back to being interested in science fiction though. I wonder if I could get into the mit Sci-Fi club. Memberships are so expensive and covers everything in case you die during your lifetime or if you die while still interested in Science Fiction, you can get memberships in case they go out of business.
That's downright hilarious. I wonder if the MIT kids have to take care of that.
Did you hear about North Korea and the Olympics?
Yes.  I saw about it in the winter Olympic games in North Korea during the Winter Olympics last year.
yes, in PyeongChang.  The North Koreans even had a cheer squad that was the only cheer squad there.
That is great, I think it is great for the country to have a cheer squad. I remember getting some crowd pictures from London and the cheer squad looked bored. That is a good squad, I remember seeing them in the crowd pictures.
I don't know. I would like to see the cheer translated to the US team.
Sounds pretty tame. I would have hoped for a little more aggressive.  The US is top of the world in the Olympics, but not at the top.
Yes, the Olympics.  Are you a fan of hockey at all?
No. I don't really like hockey. But I do like that it is an athletic sport. I hear that players can lose several pounds in a fast game. I wonder why. It's a really fast, athletic game.
What amazes me is that in 1993 a hockey player was once traded for a dollar.  He was a hockey players first name is actually "Dollar"
I wonder how much it was worth, and who was trading team?  Was it paying him not to play hockey, or was it just paying him to not play?
I do not play.  Canadians like their hockey and lacrosse.  Hockey is their national sport.
I don't play hockey or lacrosse. But I do love soccer. I have club soccer. The cheer section in my club is all about soccer. Do you play hockey? I love both sports.
I play basketball, but I have never played it.  There is a hockey rink that is just a court and it is played.
I have never done that but I have been at least a few feet away, but it is cold there.
Yes it was colder than normal on the floor. During the game they even played a Kanye West song on the game because they were colder.
I wonder if they did that at basket ball games?
I played Gold Digger. The crowd did not like the song so I had to rev it up for the crowd. Odd that the song was in a minor key and in a major key.
Yes, I wonder why they would use a minor key?
Its found in gospel and hip hop and the music typically has upward or downward sounding notes, it is found in Gospel music.
Yeah, downward sounding.  They play in a minor key.  North Korea is so sad, the Koreans want to join in on the hard cheer.  I think North Korea has a squad of upbeat, upbeat koreans that want to play "We are one place, one place"  I can join in.  It's not sad but a hard cheer!
Kanye West and Taylor Swift did a skit mocking the situation in the SNL and did a Skit mocking it
That was pretty funny when it happened, I thought it was pretty much just a swift interruption of what happened, they did mock Kanye but I think they should go back and do it again, it was a good way to mock Kanye.
No. I'm going to go read the Onion now. I'll be looking up aids in man-made news. Have a great day!
Hi there. Do you like fish or go to aquariums?
I love aquariums!  I like all fish.  Did you know that a black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight?
Nope, I didn't know that! Fish are interesting, especially those that have an appetite that is that bad! I think fish are interesting because they drink through their skin and they can drink through the skin too!
They are, I could watch those in aquariums all day. Did you know that the seahorse is the only fish with a neck?
I think seahorses are cool, fishin' is like huntin for me, or maybe it's fishin for the playstation.
lol  Did you know there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal?  Like immortal.
Hmmm, immortal?  I wonder if I would get a sting from that?  Or would it stick to me?  Would I be on land playing my playstation or Nintendo?  Maybe I could stick to some black hole research...
I like the playstation too. The Playstation 3 was used by the department of defense to build a supercomputer becuase they could not get it to be cost effective.
Wow, I bet cray, they must've been happy about that, I play the GTA theme and rock that one.  They should host a gaming competition, they play the GTA theme and Rock on!
That would be cool. Do you know much about black holes? I know they research black holes.
I wonder how that works.  consoles have come a long way.  Nintendo started out by selling playing cards.
FIFA 14 was the first game made for a console. It was the only game to span 3 console generations.
My 5 year old son and I routinely beat each other at that one.  There are no rules for soccer.  He's always better at it than me.
lol, I have a son, too.  I think he is about 5 years old.  Nintendo is almost 30 years old and started as a playing card company, lol.
Yep, and I also like basketball, like the Seattle Mariners.
Yes, baseball. They released a handheld console for Pokemon specifically.
I pretty much use those things as my gadgets, I have a playstation 3 and it's called a xrossmediabar, I can eat out of it and use it as a playstations TV.
I have never heard of it.  I think they are a video game company?
I heard that too in the early 70's.
Nintendo is valued at $104 billion!
Yep, we are the tetrapod of gamers. I am probably in the wrong line of work. It was nice talking to you. Bye.
Hi!  Do you play Playstation?  I've owned all of the consoles that have been released since they were released in 2003.  I still play Playstation 3, PS4 and PS4.
Yes, I do!  I have one of the last two.
I didn't either.  They launched in 2003 in Japan.
Yes it created a revolution that shows no signs of slowing down
Yep, the Playstation is the best-selling console to date..they have sold over 100 million consoles making it the best selling console to dated.I remember the first PlayStation
I kind of like that.
Yea, the Playstation 3 was. It sold over 50 million consoles and is still live in 2015, in terms of selling consoles.
I played AirHeart 2, Tales of Broken Wings.
No, I have not. What system is it on?
It is a playstation, nintendo switch and mac.
Cool. I like the playstation too. The department of defense used it to build a supercomputer once
I have no idea, that's interesting, I wonder why they would use them?
Apparently using playstation 3 is the cheapest option, but I'm not sure if it is the best option.
It would make you feel stupid if you discover you were playing the game wrong after you had already tried it.
It depends. I like to feel stupid, but when I get stuck and frustrated I just don't care I want to have fun. I don't want to feel like I am stuck and stupid.
That is understandable. Did you know there is an immortal jellyfish
Yea I read about the immortal jellyfish, but I didn't know they revert back to their infant state when under certain conditions and then cycling through the different life stages like in the infant state and then revert back again, I wonder what those conditions would be like for the immortal Jellyfish
What do you think is the oldest?
I think it's 300-400 years old, which would be very cool to find out, I've read of sharks and whales that are older, but I don't know for sure.
I wonder if they keep humans alive longer?  If so, what did they discover?  Maybe they will be studying the jellyfish to see if we can keep humans Alive longer.
Maybe they are, we could test that in the zebrafish which shares 84 percent of human genes and many diseases, maybe they can test that on the zebusierfish and also the 84 percent in human genes as well
Yea, that is amazing, I bet they study this fish in relations with so many diseases now.
Yea it's cool beans. Well I gtg, nice talking with you, have a good one!
It was nice talking with you too!
Peace bro! :)  :)
Hi, how are you?
I'm doing pretty good. Did you know that fish are cold-blooded?
Yes, they are warm and friendly like puppies and kitties. I would rather eat fish than have it as a pet.
Nope you're not.  The black swallower fish can be the length of a cat and eat prey twice its own length.
I would love to have that ability. I would love it if I could find one to find me some pizzas that I could fit in my gullet.
Lol, that does not sound too appealing, I would eat prety much, I wonder how much weight it would take to get that black swallower to do it lol.
I figure that it might give me time to digest it over the long weekend and then plan ahead for the next long weekend, so that will give meTime to digest.
Me too! lol. The seahorse is the only fish to have a neck.
Yes, the seahorse is unique. It's horse-like and has a face that looks like one. They can't eat fish because their face looks like it can eat fish.
Yea, I like to eat a zebrafish, if I can afford it. Did you know that a share of 84 percent of human disease associated genes are from them?
I wonder what the secret to cures are, I wonder if they can be found in the humble zebrafish with its stripey hide, the secret is in the stripey hiding of the humble Zebrafish
Maybe, there is an immortal breed of jellyfish.
That jellyfish must lead a boring life. Just watching reruns of "The Office" and wondering what's up in the universe. I would be floating around, watching re runs of "That 70s show."
Yea that does sound boring, speaking about the universe, I want to research black holes, I also want to use my Playstation 3 to research the universe.  That would sound boring.
That is good.  We need to learn more about the cosmos.  Maybe we can figure out a bunch of that and unlock the secret of life.  or at least figure out how to unlock the secrets of the cosmos!
Yea, it would make good supercomputers too, like the one the Department of Defense uses to make good ones
Yeah that is insane, I wonder how much money they used for that research, I know they used money to look for a black hole, that is crazy!
I didn't buy any nintendos, back in 2003 Nintendo released a handheld console specifically for pokemon!
Good thing they let the Pokemon craze pass them by. anyway, great chat!
You too, I'm gonna play some F-Zero, it's a racing game.
Great call! I'll have to try it!
Have a good one!  Thanks!
hi, do you like fish?
Alright,lol I used to like them. I was playing a lot of Nintendo. I still am playing airheart right now, but I was always playing a much different one, alright,lol
Nice, yeah I like it. Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck?
I was playing it wrong, fortunately! I have caught myself playing it right and was introduced to step to correct my strategy. I think it's interesting. The airheart is the only one I have ever caught.
Speaking of video games, did you know they are using them to study the black holes?
Wow. NASA?  That is totally weird.  I can't imagine what they can do with those abilities.
I know!  It's insane where technology goes these days.
I know right, I know! The US department of defense used playstations to use to build a supercomputer, wild! I guess it was cheaper than starting from scratch, but I can't believe the department of defence used playstation 3's.
Yeah, cheaper I bet.  Have you ever played grand theft auto?
I've played it once.    I didn't know it would play the soundtrack.  But I hear it has a special secret trick.  lol
yeah, that is cool. Did you play with a Nintendo?
I am a huge fan. I started playing the handheld console, which was specifically for Pokemon originally.
Oh nice.  I didn't know that.  They were founded in 1889 as a playing card company.
Yeah I did know that.
Yeah I did not know it was that long, apparently it has been around since 1989,
Cool, I just found out Nintendo produced a knockoff lego in 1985 for a toy company.
wow, I did not know that, do you like the seatle mariners?
Oh man, they sure do own a wide range of companies and interest. I heard there is an app that can order food directly from a seat to your seat and it has a wide Range of companies. Do you use the app?
No kidding! That's insane.. no kidding!
Yeah, and it was ober of only 75 million but now it's the most valued company ever. Imagine that. The technology is there, and Nintendo is Japan's most valued technology company, at $1.2 billion, or $1,104,000,000.
That makes sense, that is a lot of money but yeah, nice chat, thank you that is also a lotof money but Yeah!
Hi, have you heard of date lab?  I guess it's where people get dates according to a Wapo column.
I have not but it sounds cool. I wonder if there are matches?
I imagine it would be awkward for a lady to go on dates to a tramp like that. I would rarely do the thing.
I like the music of the jaws soundtrack.  Steven Spielberg played clarinet in it.  Did you know that?
I did not. I had no idea he played in a movie. I do like music though, I like the music from O brother where art thou from the movie, How I Saw You.
Did you know Drake went platinum with it?  I didn't realize he graduated high school before he was 18.
I know Drake and his hug with the duck. It is the date at the end of the date.
I would like to go to a concert! I would like a good date to a Drake University one. I saw them in the middle of the night.
That's impressive the Drake was determine to finish his first rap. It was bad and profane poetry set to a well-worn backbeat of the bad and Profane poetry.
Rap is hard to understand, I like it.
Kanye West is hard to understand. He thinks aids is a man-made disease. Wow.
I think Kanye West is, he married Kim Kardashian right?  His song golddigger is in a minor key.  Do you know why?
Yeah, the whole Kardashian thing is weird to me.  I don't know how much gold they have in there, but that is weird.
She is famous for her sex tape and being famous for a sex tape!  Musicians are smart though.  Big Sean has a GPA and turned down a scholarship to get signed to Kanyes label.  He has a gpa of 3.7.
I didn't know that!  I wonder what his major was?  I know he took physics in HS and SNL.  It is good that Kanye West can make fun of himself but he really does have music appreciation!  He is into physics as well as music.  He used to make fun on the SNL about how he didn't have "music appreciation."
I think he is arrogant, and I don't understand his relationship with Donald Trump.  I don
It's bizarre.  I think he's so in his own little limelight and he doesn't want to get in the face of someone like Taylor Swift.  He's the one who did the interrupting thing.  What was she doing in his face?
He shows the good side when he does, he did give his mic to a fan who was in a wheelchair at his concert, and it was nice of him to do so, it shows the bad side of him, he felt Beyonce should be the one who won, and he had to give hismic to the fan.
Yeah, that is cool.  Kayne was the child of the interrupting thing, so he knows what he is doing.
Kanye West was upset after hearing Eminems verse on Drake's album, he took two days and cancelled his appointments to rewrite it.
That sounds like a lot of attention to detail, he sure does have a lot to do. Anyway, thanks for being an excellent chat partner.
You too!  Thanks!
bye!  have a good one.
I saw that Speiberg played the clarinet on Jaws soundtrack.  He is very talented.
That's interesting, that is such an epic soundtrack!
Yea,I hear o brother, art is always good, and yea,I've hear the soundtrack to 3 times platninum is so good it has been certified 8 times platinnum by the APA, I wonder if it has a soundtrack
I think it was a great song, but its not one of my best lol, I'm not into Daft Punk, they are over my head, do you like Daft punk?
Yea Daft Punk is cool, I think they did a great job on the Tron Legacy soundtrack, and they do a great do the Trón legacy soundtrack
I agree.  Not to mention that they did it in a pretty incredible way.  Phil Collins recorded the English, Italian, Italian German, German, Spanish, French, and Spanish versions of the Tarzan soundtrack, not to mention the French version.  It's incredible.
That's pretty cool! I also like the Batman Begins soundtrack, in the form of a bat genus.
wow I never thought of that, do you know who Kanye West is?
I do like him, he has had some good albums and gold digger is a good song, it is the only top 10 hit Kayne has ever had in a minor key, and he also has 3 albums and Gold Digger is the best
He was even mocked in a SNL skit for "interrupting award shows."
No, I haven't, but I saw video of Kayne giving his mic to a fan in a wheel chair.
That is pretty cool.  What are your views on things like AIDs?  He thinks that it is a man-made disease
I think Big Sean can explain it. Did you know he had a 3.7 GPA before signing with Kayne?
Nice gpa, I'm not familiar with Drake, but I am familiar with drake.
I am.  He was a rapper on the TV show, Degrassi, right?
Nice.  He graduated high school at the age of 25 back in 2012.  I wonder if he had to quit at that age?
I guess so, most people graduate college and never go to high school like Drake did, he went to highSchool.
hahahaha  His debut studio album "Do the Right Thing" was released in 2010 but debuted at number 1 on the charts when it was released.
Nice. I heard Eminems took 2 days to rewrite his verse on Forever and it took kayne west 4 days to do the same.
Nice. I remember his debut the college dropout became a huge success and put him on the map.
Nice talking with you!  I must go.
I like how people of both races date and learn from each other.  Work well together, work well together.  It's open to the couple to just date andLearn from each others experiences.
Yeah, that is an insteresting story! Do you listen to music at all? I like to listen to Kanye West or Drake, more specifically Kanye West.
I do actually, but mostly for movie soundtracks, so I like Kayne West. I've heard he seems like a nice guy and really stands up for what he belives in, but people who are fans of his say they don't like what he stands for, but I've never heard anything against him.
I like him as a rapper but I'm not a fan of his.  His music isnt what it claims to be and he has been acting crazy,  he goes on uncalled for rants,  and just sounds all good on paper lol but he is acting crazy and not being a fan.  He has done some uncalledfor rants.  So he is not what he says he is and it sounds all bad even though his music looks good onPaper lol
He has lots of hits, but I think his work is not creative enough to work.  I do like his song Gold Digger but it is not very creative.  He feels that the democrats should be able to get back at him for getting the blacks elected, since the blacks haven't been elected in over 100 years and his song gold digger is still one of the most popular songs.
Well, personally I do not find his music good reguardless of what he says, he does sound good in my opinion, I find his songs have hits in my own opinion, and I personally find hisMusic good.
I am a huge fan of some techno and alternative rock.  Kanye is a little more dramatic and more dramatic than the people around me.  He sounds like Batman.  I think he's trying to impress everyone with his movie soundtracks.  It sounds like he's doing it to impress people with the new movie soundtrack "Jaws."  I'm not sure if it's cool or not.
I recently learned that Michael Jackson helped with the sonic for the soundtrack to the sonic 3 soundtrack.
That is amazing!  Music can make a movie or game so much more memorable.  I think it's cool to hear all the soundtracks on Spotify.  You can create custom playlist's to make a film or game more memorable!
Did you know Alicia Keys was the one who recorded the Men in Black sountrack?
That is amazing!  I heard that Daft Punk did that Tron movie in exchange for pancakes.  That would have been yummy.  In exchange for Pancakes!
Interesting, pancakes? What did they do?
I heard that they are big fan of Winnie the Pooh books.  Heard of this one people collects them and collects them all, and they are all big into the movies as well.  I think it'd be cool if Drake did songs from the books. It doesn't sound like he'd sound like a gangster but they could make it look that way.  Are you a fan of winnie the pooh books?
I didnt know that, I did know he appeared in Justin Bieber's video, Baby.
Yea Drake is very soft and sensitive. I thought Eminem had a song with Eminem but I thought Eminems part was going to change, did you know Eminem did not want to do a song in it?
He is soft and sensitive. I think he wanted his part to sound as good as Eminem's. It didn't show though. He doesn't sound asGood as Eminem.
Justin Bibers videos is soft too, but not a rapper.  He was a teen called Degrassi, and a rapper!  I am mad that he collects book "whinne pooh books", and collects them like a grown up version of whinne Pooh.  I wonder if he has ever gotten mad at a book called De Grassi.
Lol, he doesnt seem very soft and sensitive at all. He was in that video, and he was making appearances in other ones, too. I never noticed him in that one, but it was pretty soft. He is making appearances now, too, and I think he is making a lot of new video. I wonder if he has Winne the Pooh books, which are classics. I think the Winnie the Poah books are worth a lot more than the new video, but maybe thats just me, I am pretty sure he doesnt know the value of the classics, and the futur.. lol
I like his dance moves. Not very girly, but still very dance. He did get a Grammy for the video Hot Line Bling for a song for his video Hotline Bling and his dance move was not the only one to get a grammy.
I think his dancing is girly in the video, it doesnt sound good to me, I dont like that style of his, the song is ok but it doesnt seem right, I like the style of the video.
I think the song Gods plan is a good one, I heard it broke streaming records, the song is pretty good, do you like the song ?
Hello there! Do you enjoy music?
I do, although I do not spend all that much time listening to it.  How about you?
Me too. I like the soundtrack and instrumental, I like to move with the lyrical artists.
The first soundtrack I bought was guardian of the galaxy when I was a kid and the last soundtrack I buying was guardian and the first one was The Last Starfighter.
Yes.  Did you know that the soundtrack of batman begins is named after a genus of bats?  Did not know that.
That is cool! I didn't know that. I guess Steven Spielberg played the trumpet on the original Batman soundtrack years ago. I also like the Jaws soundtrack.
I enjoy when the directors play a direct part in their creations.  I like to see their creations, and the directors do well.
LOL yeah me too, I heard that the Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack is great, George Clooney did so much, lol yeah
I don't know it either.  Any other musicians you follow?
I am a huge fan of rap, live or not.  I bought their new album recently, "Live" and I really like Drake.  His song Hotline Bling is sampled from another album recently and the song hotline bling is sample from another.
I like Drake too. Surprisingly he gain initial fame as an actor on Degrassi, but surprisingly, he was not a recognized choice as a musician, but an actor. I think Drake was the best choice, but it was the most recognized choice for an actor, so surprisingly he gainInitial fame for an actress.
Wow, that's weird.  I think it was for the show that he was in.  He was in high school for 4 years and didn't graduate until he was 25 years old.  That's so weird, I wonder if he went to a high school that was still in highSchool when he was doing that.
I guess he was a perfect fit for the show, high school is a perfect Fit for him.
I guess, but I guess he was hurt by finishing school so late. I know that his album "Sorry" broke a lot of records, it was on top of the best selling album for 9 nonconsecutive weeks and had over 400,000 views.
He is very successful, but he does odd things to get away with spending so much. He's also had first edition children's books.
I heard he bought copies of Charlotte's Web and Winnie the Pooh. I've never seen them before.
In any case, do you like Kanye West?
He is a weird guy. He thinks AIDS is a man-made conspiracy disease. It's kind of like a man's conspiracy disease, but with aids
He thinks vaccines cause autism. I hope he is wrong.
Oh my god I hope not! He shakes head and rolls eyes at the people he thinks he is celebrity, he sure is. But I have to admit I have never checked that out myself, I just hear his music is good and I listen to it when I hear hisMusic and he just shakes head, rolls eyes and says "oh my God I hope he doesn't, I don't think so", I have always thought he is just a celebrity, but I have also never really checked into why people think that, I have only listen to the music myself.
I think music is great, I listen to it to treat my body and to help me with medicine.  I trust most musicians and my doctors to be the best possible case in case I need medicine. I personally have had a wonderful time chatting with you, I think his music is GREAT!  I will listen to him and trust most musician's medicine, but not his doctors!
Cool! I like him too, nice to talk to you too!
Have a nice day!  Thanks!
Hi, how are you? Do you like astronomy?
I do, very interesting.  I read about it all the time and it is always interesting. I read that the ganymede is so large, I think we should look it up.
Jupiter's moon is one of the five planets visible to the naked eye.
I guess I don't know. I don's the size of it, but I'm not sure.
It must be, I would think. The planet Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise and has no seasons, it must be boring because of that, there are no seasons
Uranus has a strange rotation too. It rolls instead of spinning.
Mars sounds like a weird planet, also called red planet and named after the Roman god of war. Unique name and also called the weird planet and Named after the roman god ofWar.
I did not know that.  Did you know that iron oxide is the only known to be a substance that can cause iron oxide to become iron?
Yes. Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is considered a terrestrial planet. However, it is too hot to be considered a planet since it is so hot from the Sun.
Must be, especially with the polar icecaps.
True and valleys and deserts, it is pretty diverse. It is the smallest planet in the solar system but also the most diverse.
I did not know that, did you know that wifi is a byproduct from astronomy?
That is pretty neat.  I wonder what the town in Sadiqat Shahr in Iran is called.  That town bought an observatory.  On special occasions I turn on the TV at night and look at the sky.  Sadeat ShahR in Iran has been known to be known for astronomy.  It's special to me.
I wonder how many people go to that American town.
I am sure people would think that it is not the smallest planet, and that we have enough mercury in the US and too much mercury in other people.
No, I didn't know that. Do you know why?
I am interested.  I guess there is a Mars colonization project planned for 2023.  There is also a reality tv show about it.
I think it would be cool. I think plants like lichen could live there as well.
Yeah, sounds cool.  The days would be a bit long but at constant 1g acceleration, that's a constant for sure.
Yes that is long!  I wonder why that is?
It does lol, I wonder if we'll ever get a trip to Mars?  I don't want to get there.  It was nice chatting with you!
Same here!  Have a day bye.
Have a nice day!  Thanks!
Good evening!  Do you like astronomy?  Do You know much about Venus and its tilt and the seasons it has?  It doesn't tilt, so it doesn't have seasons like it does on Venus.
I enjoy learning about it.  I think there is so much interesting about Venus.  The solar system is pretty vast.
It sounds fascinating. It sounds fascinating to me that there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree fahrenheit weather!
Wow, that sounds dangerous. In fact, all the planets would fit between the earth and the moon! In fact all the 5 planets would fits around the moon.
That is fascinating! And there are precursors to life in a planetary system that is 455 light years away that was discovered and it is the same planetary system where we have the precursORS to life!
I wonder how they determined that. Is it a microscopic issue? Is it telescopic?
I was reading about observational versus theoretical astronomy.  They are using different research methods to try to detect the building blocks of life using these research methods.  I think we may be the only ones who can actually detect the Building Blocks of Life.
There is also a planet that orbits four stars, can you imagine how complex the orbit is of a planet?
I think I heard about it before, it is called the 5th planet.
I read that it's called the "13th star" or something like that.  The math that describes orbiting one star is complex.  It's crazy to think about.  But the math that's describes orbiting that one star
It is controversial because the planets were redefined as an astronomical union, and this definition is based on what a object orbits and disregards its mass.  I think it's a little too much, since it's what the object orbits, and not what it actually orbits and disregard of its mass, but I'm not sure.
I suppose that is why Pluto was downgraded.  I wonder if it has a dark side.  The Chinese are controlling their rover on the moon.  Do you know if the Chinese are controlled their rover is going to go to the dark side?
I know!  Did you know Ceres, Pallas, Ceres, Juno and Vesta were all once considered planets but were downgraded?
Yes, mankind has studied astronomy for a long time, and the Vatican has an observatory for studying it, it has the observatory since 1846.
I think the ancient babylonians did.
It is a strange world we live in. On another subject, did you know that Harlow Shapley, a noted astronomer decided to study the old catalog at college?
I heard that the development of wifi was a byproduct of astronomical research led to it being a by product of astronomicalResearch.
I do remember teflon was a byproduct of space exploration, the USA used to own most of it.
That's fascinating. Were you aware that the sounds are higher pitched on Mars because of atmospheric differences? I wonder why? I think sounds are usually higher pitched than here.
I have read that before but I wonder where that sound comes from? It makes sense. On the one occasion when I shut the lights off and look at the night sky, I like to shut off the sound and just see the night's sky. On occasion I like the way that the lights improve my view of the Earth, I've read that there is a town in Iran that is entirely out of water!
Wow that must be one fun place to visit!  Good talking to you, have a wonderful evening!  It's a fun place!
Hello. Did you see Deadpool 2? It was a great movie.
I agree with you. It was fun and I really liked Ryan Reynolds in it.
He nailed the role. I liked the movie too, it had a pretty good cast, and I liked him in it, it was a pretty well done movie, I think he nailed the Role.
Yeah, I liked the cast, Ryan Reynolds is one of the best, he was in Deadpool 2 and Deadpool 3 as well and Sharp-pei, and I think the cast is really good
That is an interesting fact, cool fact, the video game cost less than the movie, I think that video game would probably make more than the Movie, interesting fact.
Wow, apparently the voice of the mystery villain is ryan.
Did you know Deadpool is the highest grossing R rated film, and has a better director than Cameron or Lucas?
Speaking of superheroes, do you like Marvel comics?
I do love the movies and the marvel Comics universe, I love the Movies, one of my favorite heroes is DC Comics, do you have any favorite heroes in the Marvel comics universe?
I like superheroes too.  They could have bought Sony when they offered them for $50M and now have bought sony for $1.65B!
I heard they bough spiderman movies with Toby Maguire as the star. I don't know if that was a good spiderman. I wonder if he was a very good spider man.
Yeah, I agree, and I think they bought the rest when they had the chance, I think.
I agree, it was a poor investment decision, they are now worth billions and they are pretty good, the X-Men are also worth billions, they did well with that one
Marvel successfully argues in court that mutants in x-men are not humans.
I didnt know that, I wonder if winning that argument helped them?
Yeah it did, they paid the lower rate on toys.
I'm guessing that made them millions. Wonder Woman was a great film. I haven't watched it, have you?
Yeah, I loved it.  I'm looking forward to seeing the new one.
I thought it was a decent film, I would like to watch the second one as well, it generated a lot of money, I know it generated
Yeah and it is the 2nd highest grossing superhero origin movie, so that says something!
I guess Wonder Woman was the highest grossing WWI movie, she has a lot of fans and the highestgrossing WWW movie
Hi, how are you doing? Do you like superheroes? I like Wonder Woman, the film they made based on the DC superheroes, Wonder Woman.
I like Wonder Woman. I guess it was the top grossing movie of the 2018 so far.
I haven't seen it either, is it good?  The lead actress Gal gadot has done a fantastic job, she served in the Israel defense forces and I think she did a fantasticJob.
I would love to hear stuff about that, I didn't realize she had done good prep for the part. I wonder if she got the part by auditioning for it? I would love that. I would really love to hearing stuff like that.
Yes! I know.  She actually appeared in a group made up of a group of secretaries, and she was just a woman character, not a secretary.
Well, this year has been really good for women. The top 3 highest grossing movies were female led.
Cool! I guess it was successful for them. Comic book movies have always been successful. Marvel offeredSony $50 million to use Spiderman as one of their characters but they rejected it because they wanted Spiderman. I guess Marvel wanted SpiderMan.
That is really cool! Marvel created a character named Blue Ear for a boy with hearing problems, because the boy had some hearing problems and Marvel created the character named blue ear.
Yes, he didn't want to wear his hearing aids and told his mother that he didn "not want to be one of the super heroes" but Marvel created him. It kind of got him started on his own. He started to wear hearing aids to wear them, and marvel created his own super heroes.
Cool.  Marvel and DC have their companies' universes separate.  DC's DC was designed to be the only character owned by both companies.  I would think there would be more.
Yes, it must be big business to find ways to keep your investment safe!  I think it is interesting that Disney has a contract with Universal Studios to keep all the big Marvel characters east of the Mississippi due to leave most of the big marvel characters east.  It is interesting they have that contract with them.  I wonder what they do with the characters once the contract is over.  Is that like a contract to leave your investment Safe deposit box in Mississippi due in the US?
I guess you don't need a lawyer to understand the Mississippi thing.  I guess I like the funny dark humor in the Dead Pool movies.  That's some funny dark comedy.
I didn't see either of those but I know that the highest grossing r rated film not directed by James Cameron or George Lucas, is the highestgrossing R rated film
I guess it cost more to make the video game than the movie. Development is expensive. I guess it would cost more than it did to make it. I know the development is expensive to make a video game.
I know it is.  There was so much competition for directors like James Cameron.  He read the script and championed the film to Fox executives, who were nice enough to let him read the scripts and championed it to Fox, and that is how it got to Fox.
That's good!  It's true that people want to see an actor doing superheroes.  I can't imagine anyone other than Reynolds doing Deadpool 2.  Can you imagine another actor doing superhero?
I know that Ryan Reynolds believed he and Ryan Reynolds crossed over into a comic book series when he did Deadpool describe that his shar pei was his shar pi. It was odd to see someone else take that role.
True, I think it's all about personality.  I think he is better at Iron Man.  He looks like Downey Jr.
One thing about Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is that he was a musical theater Australian unknown actor.  I wonder if the director knew he was going to be a musical Theater Australian unknown.
Interesting, I guess the case could be made for Gal gadot being the first woman to appear in it too. I guess it would have to be made to look like Gal gadet if that was the case.
She was born to play the role!  I think she did, and she has the right look to play it.  I know she's done it for most people.  Thanks for chatting with me, I learned a lot of new and fun information today.
Hi there! Do you like Deadpool?
I have not.  I am a pretty big fan of the Marvel comics universe.  Have you?
Yeah, it's really good and funny.
Ryan Reynolds was in Deadpool 2 and carved out a pretty iconic role for himself. He was great in that role. He did really well.
Yeah, the comic deadpool describes him as shar-pei, and the lead ryan reynolds is a perfect name for the role lol.  He was destined for the roles and the role was perfect for him!  He is definitely the shar-pea of the role LOL
That is awesome. James Cameron and David Fincher were involved in pushing for Deadpool 1 and 2. I think James Cameron was a pretty big part of it. He made a pretty good one.
Wow, that's awesome!  I didn't know that!  The Deadpool videogame cost $15,000,000 to make and I played the game before the movie, it's pretty funny,  I wonder how much the movie will cost lol
I haven't seen it either, either. I am not really a fan of the movies, but I like the Marvel characters. I know that Stan Lee's estate is actually more valuable than most Marvel characters, and is more valuable that the Stan Lee estate.
Yeah I love all the Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers, Thor.  I guess I can pick and choose,  but yeah I love them all.  What about you?
I'm a big fan of Thor, I thought Ragnorak was the best Marvel movie, I think it should have picked up where the first one picked up. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor, he's awesome!
Thors the best! Thor ragnarok was hilarious.
I think that was really funny back in 2013. I bet it was funny back then when Sony could have bought all cinematic rights to Marvel and they decided rejected the offer of $25 million from them and instead went for $50 million from the DC/Marvel.
I guess they really wanted spiderman, it couldve been big awhile ago, I guess.
Yeah, that was crazy.  I know that Marvel wants to have every character owned by them.  Oops!
No, I didn't know that.  What is it?
 Marvel has a character called Access, and he has the sole purpose of keeping a separate universe separate from the Marvel universe. Kind of weird, but I like it.
That is really cool, they should make a movie about that. Marvel has a ton of movies and tv shows too, I like marvel.
I heard Wonder Woman was good, but I don't know about the other movies.
Yeah Wonder Woman was great I think it was really good. I like the newer Superman with Henry Cavill and the Batman series. They are coming out with a new Batman series coming out soon too and I also like the TV show the Flash and also batman lol I haven't seen that one yet but it looks good
Cool, I liked Wonder Woman too, I like Gal Gadot, she is so cool, and Wonder Woman is a new one as well.
I think she is awesome. She is such a great actress. I also liked her in the Fast N Furious series and also the law. She served in the Israeli army and was in the IDF, she is a great Actress.
I did not know that. I do remember the classic lynda carter wonder woman from the fast n furious series, and the fast N furious series.
I have watched the older Wonder Woman, and yeah she plays Giselle in Fast N Furious.
I remember my parents didn't like that movie, but I think it was pretty good. I might have to check it out again. Marvel started out pretty good, I think.
It has been awhile, but its been fun chatting with you.
Hi, how are you?
Im great! Are you interested in astronomy at all?
Hello - I am! How are you?  Yes - I do like it!  What about yourself?
I have been reading about it for a while, but I am impartial because I have not been reading as well, so a couple of facts for you.  I was surprised to know that as September ends, the planet looks a little brighter than it had in the previous months, so I am not surprised.  September is always impartial.
People have been watching the skies forever, since ancient Babylonians.  Nowadays, people can keep track of all five planets in the solar system and Jupiter with mathematical precision.  They are able to track the sun and Jupiter and pretty much all the planets in our system.
I know, right?  Only five planets in the solar system are visible to the naked eye and none of them without special equipment.  Only 3 in the system arevisible to the unprotected eye.
The tech for viewing planets is one of the benefits of the new research into improving astronomy, and the research into improved tech for the other areas. The research into improve astronomy is a byproduct of the research and critical step in creation of wi-fi, one of its benefits.
That's pretty neat, and the information gained from that is compiled to produce sounds and songs that illustrate what space is like for visually impaired individuals, too! I wonder if there are any sounds and Songs that illustrate the information compiled to help visually impaired people, or just the information gathered by looking at space.
I wonder if we will ever be able to live on Mars?  A mars colonization project is planned for 2023.
I do not think colonization on Mars is even feasible.
Flying to Mars under constant 1g accelaration would take only 2-3 days.  That is the tech that will get us there.  It will take some time to get there though.  I don't think flying to Mars would take more than 2-5 days.
I don't think we have tech that is capable of those speeds.  I don't know that humans survive at those speeds, but I think we are capable of going anywhere.  The sunset on Mars is actually blue, which is pretty neat.
I guess it is because of the atmosphere, I don't know.  I guess it could support some kind of life.  Not sure what kind ofLife though.
I would like to visit the saadat shahr. That's what the small stargazing community is called and it has a strong passion for stargazes. The residents of this astronomy town have a strong love of stargaze, and the community is Called "Astronomy Town"
Did you know they have detected building blocks of life in a planetary system 455 light-years away. Astronomers think they will find a planet that can support life.astronomers think it could be within the habitable zone and within the 5th century of the sun, it might have the building blocks to support life..
It's called something else I forgot the name.  I wonder what it is.  The movie with Matt Damon really convinced me of that.  It's called "A New Hope".  That movie with matt damon really convinced you.
I don't remember.  It's expensive and high risk.  I think we are designed to last, not designed to go anywhere so I would invest in it.  There is no way I want to live on another planet.
I agree with you there. I also agree that the planets have changed as scientific knowledge advanced, and human perception of the planets has too. Today, older generations of people feel that the solar system and planets have changes that most people in their older generations couldn't even tell you what they see today!
I wonder how the younger generations, who have learned over the years, feel.  I know that I feel old, but I'm astonished at the universe we've come to in just a few years.  It's such a tiny place!  Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!  The universe is a tiny time and a tiny Place!
Have a great day.  Thanks!
Thanks! You too! I'm going to look it into.
hey there, do you like superhero movies?
I do like superhero movies, do you?
I do like superhero movies, my favorite publishing company is actually in charge of superhero movies now, their in charge
I do my favorite publishing company for the superhero movies is Marvel. What about you?
I'm not sure, I don't really have a favorite, do you have a favourite superhero?
I do not but my favorite superhero is Batman.Who is yours?
Superman is a classic. Apparently Spider-man is another big superhero owned by Sony, which is a big superhero owns by Sony.
Spiderman is the only big superhero owned by Sony, but Superman is also owned by them, but it seems like it is because of the partnership with Marvel Studios, since they own DC and Marvel.
I heard that they want to give every character access.
No I have never heard of Access, what kind of superhero is he?
It's a character whose main power is being able to separate himself from Marvel, who are co-owned by the studios, and DC, who own Marvel and DC but are separate studios.
Interesting!  I like the concept of that character, but I prefer the new character from DC.  Marvel is a studio now, not a studio.
I don't pay much attention to studies on either one, I just pay much Attention to the movies they make. Marvel did create a special superhero for a little boy, though.
What superhero did they create for that little boy?  What superhero?
It was called Blue Ear because the little boy was hard of hearing.
That is heart-warming, people!  Marvel claimed that mutants can be considered human, but some people don't.  They had to pay a lower rate on X-Men toys because they didn't qualify as dolls...and Marvel was in court trying to pay that court.  I wonder if mutants can actually qualify as doll.
They must have good lawyers.  did you ever watch wonder woman?
Yes I watched Wonder Woman.  Did you know Gal Gadot fought in the Israeli special forces?
No, I didn't know that.  I wonder how many skills she thought she had when she was hired to do the testing for catwoman and then hired.
I was surprised to hear that because I thought auditions used to be so straightforward.  I thought Auditions would have been more straightforward. I can't imagine having to find the truth.
Yeah I know, I think it was good. Wonder woman is the highest grossing superhero origin movie and the highestgrossing superheroorigin movie ever!
That makes me happy. I think I saw that movie in the theaters. I'm glad Wonder Woman did so well. I've never seen that movie, but I'm sure I'll see it soon.
No I did not see it, was it good? Apparently it is the highest grossing WWI movie
It was so good, I saw it. Nice talking to you, have a good one.
Same here, have a good one.
Hi, how are you?
I am good. Are you fascinated about Mars?
I'm good, thanks for asking.  Mars is really crazy these days huh?
I heard that you can actually hear sounds on Mars!
Yes, they have a higher pitch than sounds on earth, about 5x as much
Yes, they do have a higher pitch, but that is due to differences in atmosphere.  Sounds on Mars may be different than sounds on Earth.  But they probably have the same pitch.
Cool. Did you know that the UN is going to fund a Mars colonization project?
that is crazy, I don't know how they are going to fund that, do you?
Hmmm, they are creating a reality tv show?
I love reality tv show,  do you watch it?
Haha I don't know, I'm the complete opposite! I wonder how long it will take to get to Mars, do you think they'll get there before we do?
I thought it would be only 3 days, but I think it would take a lot longer because of the acceleration, so I think you would have to fly to Mars under constant 1g acceleration, I wonder how long it would took to fly from here to Mars.
No it's much longer than that!  I think movies make it seem slower for airtime lol,  but I know movies make them seem slower than that.
That is true, have you heard about the lost satellite on Mars?
Yes, I have. How did Lockheed Martin lose it?
Locheed Martin was using the imperial system while Nasa used the metric system while NASA was using it.
Boy how funny! Imagine if earth had shard of glass that precipitated sideways at 4500 mph?
That would be terrifying, especially in 2000 degree fahrenheit weather
They probably have great tans though, they are from another planet haha, they must have great Tans
True!  Scientists even measured that!
Good question! Anyways, great chat! Have an awesome day!
Did you hear that Elmo is the only non-human to testify before the US congress?
I did hear that. I also heard they use subways to transpport staff between the capital and their offices. I wonder if they have to use sub subway to transport staff between them.
wow. did you know there is fantasy congress?
I did not know that! I aslo know that they have a baseball game that dates back to 1887.  Do you know how old a baseballgame is?
Wow I didn't know that. Are you a Star Wars fan?
I am a fan! Are you a fan of the old ones?
I do, George W. is a genius
He has done so much both creatively and financially!
Yes, I like the series that they released in 2011, it was released in the UK too.
The first three films were nominated for academy awards for best combined box office and the films were nomination for academy Awards in 2013 and 2016.
Yeah, the legacy of the first 8 is living on long after they're gone.
I read his ex-wife was the one who killed Obi Wan, I like him a lot from the movies
I feel like the movies have not been too good lately though, not as good as the video games.
I have no idea if the new one will be any good.  I know that the old one was tension filled, and tension filled and with a little too much Leia incestual good. I think the new ones will be like the old ones where they have to kill off Obi Wan to get the idea out.  Maybe if they make the kiss from The trench a run it will go better.  But with luck, they will run into the same fate as the first one.  They had to killOff Obi Wan because he was trying to kiss Leia.  He had no idea how much trouble that would cause.
Wow, drama! James Earl Jones spent 3 hours only recording all of Darth Vadors lines, all of darth vadors Lines
I wonder if he knew he was going to get demanded to do that much?  If he was only paid $5,000 an hour he would talk slower and not take the hour that they demanded!
That would have been a lot of money back then, but not a lot now. He got his money back.
I think so, it made up about 40% of the total box office, so it was just a small percent since it had a main character who was only a smallpercent of the whole total boxoffice.
I know right!  My friend, only 5 hours of work will work for me LOL... I wonder if astronauts can whistle in a space suit.  I wonder what they would whistle if they were astronauts?
Whsitle about that?
I have no idea, I would have to ask my question again after this fact, lol. Apparently there is a water cloud in space that hold 4 trillion times the amount of water on earth and I wonder why they couldn't suit up in that fact, I wonder if there is another suit out there lol.
There are a lot of questions I have too.  Thanks for the chat.  I think I will go now.  Have a great day!
Hi, do you know much information about space?
Absolutely, I like space!
I find it interesting that astronauts cannot whistle in the space suit.
I know that is interesting, I wonder if it prevents that from happening?
I am not sure, maybe they just talk in private.  I think it is pretty neat that they can touch helmets on space walks and even touch helmets in space.
Yes, they do!  I wonder if they bump helmets real quick, like when they walk around?
I'm not sure. Are you a star wars fan?
I'm a huge fan, and a huge supporter of Carrie Fisher, I rip on that film.
I saw the first one a long time ago.  She directed it in 1977 and told George Lucas that it would never succeed.  Fox News, which owns merchandising rights to the film, told George lucas that it wouldn't succeed. If he had told them that, they would have made a fortune.
I know he made a fortune, I never knew that, and they thought that the toys would not make any money, I bet they regret every bit of that lol, they thought the toys were going to make more than the entire franchise, who knew, and yes he made more than they did, I wonder why the toys didn't make any of the films
I am sure! He and his wife Marcia are the reason they made it so good.  She even won an award for her, I believe.
That is good for her.
Obi Wan dying.  Good luck kiss with Leia and the good luck kiss.
I had forgotten about it.  Do you know what it is?
I think it's interesting that the things that I haven't watched yet are the only things that have been dubbed in Navajo.  It's the first movie ever dubbed in a native American language and the first movies ever dubbed into a Native American language.
Wow, I had no idea, I did know that Star Wars was a historical movie in pop culture and that it came out so long ago but I had not idea it was the only historical movie.
The cool thing is James Earl Jones only spent only 2 and half hours recording Darth Vaders lines
Yes, he does. Did you know that James Earl Jones was the voice of Mufasa in the Lion King, the remake of the remake?
That is really cool, good to know! Good chatting with you!
Same here.  Thanks!
Thanks!  You too!
Hi! Are you a star wars fan?
I personally love Star Wars. George Lucas was a visionary for creating it.
Did you know that stars wars made him a billionaire?
I doubt it, the films were nominated for Academy Awards and were commercially successful, the first three films were nominate for academy awards
Wow, George Lucas' wife got an Oscar for editing one of his films, and that's how he got his first Oscar.  I didn't know he had one.
Yeah it sounds like it, she was the major reason for making the last original film in 2013.
I think she did too,  too bad lol  it was really good,  so good!
Maybe, I don't know. I think it's cool that George Lucas was able to get paid so much for licensing and merchandising.
It definitely did, it is worth it! Did you hear about how much James Earl Jones was paid for his voice?
I think he was paid $700,000? I wonder how many number they are still paid for?
I know right,  I was hoping he made like 300 dollars per hour I bet lol I didn't see the movie but I was really hoping he would have made like $700 dollars perhour I bet LOL.
Yeah I am sure he did!  Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo making it the first major film to be dubbed in a native american language.
That is awesome.  They must be in demand.
Yeah, I don't know. The film is set in space, which I think is an interesting concept, symbolic, I love how the film isSet in space. I think its very interesting concept.
I know right, I think space is so mythical and out of this world, the first time in a very long time, pun intended lol.
I would love to go to space, but apparently astronauts in space suit cannot whistle.
I think it's because the gravity makes it impossible to use the whistle in that space lol,
Haha, I know right? I'm not sure. Good to know. Astronauts can't touch helmets either, but a spacewalk wanted to talk in private and they were able to touch helmets.
That's awesome!  That's a secret code!  lol  They must have a secret Code!  It was so nice chatting with you!
Astronauts used to get free corvettes back in the day! Well it was nice talking with you, too! Bye!
Have a great weekend! I need a corvette now! lol
Hi how are you today?
Good, yourself? Do you like it?
I'm doing great! enjoying this snow day! How about you? What politics are you into? I like Jersey and all of it's politics so I'm enjoying thisSnow day.
Wow that's awesome! I am huge into politics, I'm from Ohio, it's raining here, but I am not huge into it either.
I don't know much about it, but I did know Hilary was president of young republicans in college so it makes sense.
Wow, I did not know that.  I don't support Trump.  She is hot headed but I think she is trying to do some good things and not support Trump because he is too hot headed.
I can't say that I support him either, he's gotten worse, maybe Kanye should run for president in the next election because I think he could do better, maybe even Kanye should Run for President, I don't think he would get much support
LOL.  That's funny.  I'm not a huge Trump supporter, but I would like to see Kanye run for President.  Do you think he would do well?
Kanye believes aids is a man made disease.
haha yea, he does say weird things at times
I saw him once in concert.  He gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair that was in a chair.  I guess it was a good thing he wasn't a fan.
He does, he is really good, I think he stole the mic from Taylor Swift the other time he did that, pretty low move at the time,
Yea, I remember that, poor Taylor swift.
Yea, rapper Big Sean had a GPA of 3.7 and turned down a scholarship in Michigan because he had a better GPA than everyone else there, cool move
That is impressive!  I would like to see a big Sean concert!
Wow that's cool! What was the first concert you went to?
I think it was great.  Kanye is really talented, in my opinion.  He was so talented he did an SNL skit mocking himself for interrupting award shows.
I am not a huge fan of Kanye's music.
Me neither, I do like his song gold digger though, it is in the top ten songs of all time for the top 10 song
I heard that song,  have you heard that songs?
I have not either.  What is the song?
It was good talking to you.
Hillary Clinton was president of young republicans in college.
I did not. I am surprised by that.
Apparently she adopts a southern drawl when campaigning in southern states.
Taylor Swift is taller than Kanye. Did you know that?
Kanye is an interesting character, he thinks AIDS is a man made disease, but I think he thinks it is.
Evel Knievel sued him for $67,000,000.  I wonder why?
I didn't know he sued someone. Why would he do that?
I do not, I wonder if he did any damage to his reputation or not, but I thinkTouch the sky, I think it was for damage.
Kanye was really nice to a fan once though, he gave a mic to a kid in a wheelchair at his concert, the fan was in a chair at his show, he was in the concert, and gave it to him.
I head he does that sometimes
He was 41 years old, and has accomplished a lot in the last 30 years he has been responsible for cultural movements and progressions within hip hop.
Yes.  He even incorporated gospel in some of his songs.
That is cool, it really tells you how eclectic his music was.
Yeah, pretty interesting. I have to say I like him as well.
Kanye's most successful songs are in a minor key, and Gold digger is the only music in a major key.
I play a lot of music, in minor keys, so I can see that. I heard that Kayne barely plays in minor key, which is sort of surprising.
That is surpising Kanye.  Have you ever heard of dragon energy?  Kind of like the dragon energy they use in surpised Kanye.
No I have not, is there more than just that? I would think there would be a lot more interesting to know.
Yeah he is.  I think Kanye is up to his tweeting now, with dragon energy.
lol I wonder if they make a soft drink called that,  or something else lol
Haha! That would be interesting. It's surprising that he's so far outside of the scope of what Kanye is known for. It is surprising.
Did you vote in the last one? Did you vote for either Hillary or Kanye?
I would have to say Kanye West.  He says she is gold diggers, but I think she is more right than Kanye West
He could release duets and make a ton of cash. $15 per ticket.
I would love to see them in office.  I would love them to get into Kanye's conspiracy theories like how aids is a man-made disease and he thinks he is in on it.
I think that the aids conspiracy is a well known area, I mean he thinks aliens brought aids to this area, he could figure out the secret files and find out why the aliens brought it, or maybe they have secret files on all the secret Files and find it out.
haha, ya I think so, do you remember the first hurricane katrina telethon years back?
No, I didn't, I don't think so. What crazy stuff do you think the govt caused the hurricane?
Yea, George Bush didn't care about black people, he said he didn't live there and that he didn's care about Black people.
That doesn't make sense from my point of view.  I mean after that hurricane devastated the place, why would it make sense?
True. I wish hindsight is 20/20. Do you remember when Kanye interrupted Taylor Swift? It does sound crazy, but it's true. I remember when he interrupted Taylor.
Yes, when he busted on stage and grabbed the mic.  Crazy!  He could be president one day if he busted in on stage!
I think he could be president, he is slightly crazy, he could become president, but he has not been president yet.
Kanye would be a running mate for sure, and I don't think Trump would want to be running mate to a Kanye.
I wonder if Trump and Kanye would get along.  I wonder how they would get rid of Mike Pence.  They could have gotten rid of him.
Kanye and Trump?  That would be a play on the name.
Man, Trump and him would conflict like never before.
Tump would probably like to play golf in his free time.  I meant he likes to play Golf, not VP.
Trump would probably do it if it would make his brand better. Too bad his is too valuable and most of his net worth is attributed to how much he has to make hisbrand. He's not worth $500M.
That is true.  He could put a trump sign on the guest house and rent it out.  They could put it on the house and Rent it out to Trump.  Great chat!  Thanks, you were very true.
Yes, put a Trump sign up there. Kanye would take care of it. He wears that hat anyways.
Thanks!  Have a fine night!
Thanks! You too! :)
Hello, how are you? Have you seen the Black Panther movie?
I have not seen it but I am not a big super-hero movie person. Have you?
Yeah,  they are pretty good and apparently good.  I have to take lessons from them lol  Did you know they are available in india?
I tend to doubt the film makers want to remind Africa and India of their shared past.  They are both quite different.  I tend to wonder why they want to reminded of a shared past at all.
hahahaaa.. who are the inspirations then?
It's interesting Marvel studios put up some of their characters as collateral for movies, I suppose to keep making them.  I wonder how successful Merril Lynch is.  He's been making movies since 1948 and he's the only one to be successful!
True, but black panther is the richest super hero so he's probably the richest.
I think he is richer than Bruce Wayne. It is a separate universe.
I think we're talking about Marvel here. Tony Stark is worth $500 million and Black Panther is the only superhero to be worth $200 million and black panther is worth only $50 million.
I guess I don't know, it escaped my notice that it's a Marvel universe film. Black Panther was the first Marvel Universe film I think.
I think I've seen every Marvel movie. I'd like to watch a Disney movie, too. Have you seen a Disney Movie before?
Umm...I guess I would have to sign up for Disney I suppose. I don't really see kids movies anymore and I kind of tend to like kids movies myself.
True, but Frozen was the first disney film to be directed by women and it was the only Disney film that was!
I didn't know that.  I kind of like that. Frozen was the first female director.  It's sad that it's taken that long to get a female director though.
I guess it was the toy industry taking advantage of putting toys out before the film is released. It was late 80s and early 90's, so I guess that was the game.  Maybe they had the toy Industry taking advantage and not taking them off the table until the film was done.
I know right, kids and their parents are always on the hook for all that money that they get from the kids.
Geez!  I know.  Wreck it Ralph development started back in 1983!  WOnder it Ralph?
I remember that too!  Funny how the vultures were supposed to be voiced by the Beatles, in the original jungle book...
I saw that too.  The Lion King was dubbed in Zulu for Africa.
That is interesting,  circle of life is the only song sung in zulu,  I would love to hear it!
Yes, it would be on YouTube. Good chat!
Hi. How are you? Have you seen Black Panther? It is directed by Ryan Coogler. It's actually pretty good.
I have not seen it yet, but I'm a fan of Danai Gurira, and she's great in it, I think the movie was pretty good, what about you?
I also liked Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa, he was an excellent choice for the role
Good, good, good! I thought it was so funny and funny with the cast that he just stole the show. Women kind of did too! I was really impressed with the box office as well. It's surprising there's over $1 billion for a movie that didn't sneeze or have a sneezy. That's incredible!
I also enjoyed Letitia Wright's performance.
Yeah, I thought she was really beautiful and I liked her play the tech genius sister, she was very likable and funny. I also really enjoyed the wardrobe and the Indian influence on the character and I thought it was beautiful. I think that I really enjoyed that
I didn't know she did that either. Funny thing about black panther, it was censored in the indian version, praise hanuman. The indian versions did not praise hinuman.
I understand. It was funny to me. I thought the Indian people would be more careful. I think they were offended that the villain is praising one of their deities and not the opposite. The whole thing is so crazy that I thought it was funny and I felt sorry for the Indian People. I guess I just need to be more sure of myself. The Black Leopard is the opposite of the deity so they have to be careful, but I thought, "I thought the Black Leopard was a deity, so we better be careful. We don't want to be offended by a villain!"
Yea, I didn't know the character was created in the 1920's when the black panther party was formed.
I know a lot of people never really made the connection until the issue. I find it very interesting that the story behind the background of the Black Panther is the richest superhero. The information is fascinating. It's incredible that the richest Superhero is not the richest! I never would have made the Connection.
Yep, Black Panther is the richest superhero. I wonder if he has any more money than Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark. Did you know that Tony Stark has more money? He's the richest comic book superhero ever.
Yeah, I would have guessed Bruce Wayne would be richer.  Wow, it's nice to know who the richest ones are.  I didn't know he is from Marvel until recently and he is so young that he's only 18, but wow, I wouldn't have guessedBruce Wayne to be richer?  I wonder if they are real or fictional?  Wonder who the 3 richest ones were in the 21st century are?
Yea, it is.  They had a lot of cultural exchanges with the siddhis cane to India in Ancient times, like the ones they did with India and Africa.
Both countries have very rich histories, and have been invaded and colonized by other countries.  I imagine that both have major major issues with poverty and spiritual interference in their things.  India is incredibly talented in so many ways, and I knew that they had a number of talented people all over the world. But they also have a number to some major issues such as poverty and political interference.
I think India has a great economy, and they are also very knowledgeable in mathematics, astronomy, astronomy , medicine, water management, navigation, metallurgy, medicine, navigation , textiles, water, etc, and knowledgeable in Mathematics.  India also has a very great economy.
It's surprising that India still produces so many engineers, engineers, doctors, mathematicians, and mathematicians. It's very ingrained culturally. It is amazing how far we have come since the invasion of the US centuries ago, and it is also surprising to think about how long our progress has taken since then, but it's amazing that our determination and talents and talents have been able to keep pace with the changes in the world over the centuries, and altogether, it's surprising how much determination, determination, and determination is still ingrained culturally, despite so many invasion attempts, centuries ago.
I have always found it fascinating how different cultures studied astronomy.  Did you know that ancient babylonians and the ancient indians study it?  I wonder why?
I wonder why those ancient cultures realized that astronomy was the way to navigate.  I began to study it myself.  It's not something that hurt me now.  Astronomy is a theoretical study of the sky.  But, it's so many branches and branches that it developed over time and over time.  Think about it, it began with a lot of theoretical branches but then branches developed into observational and theoretical thinking.  You can head into it with a whole lot of different ways to look at the sky and think about it.
Astronomy researchers also have to date events like that of Odysseus taking back the throne of Ithaca, I wonder if they can do that with astronomy researchers.
It was interesting to know that. I enjoy historical information. I also like Homer's "The Odyssey" which is amazing that astronomy was able to track it down with mathematical precision. Apparently it happened on April 11, 2006. That would be interesting to see.
I didn't know that!
Do you like the movie Black Panther?
I didn't but I have heard it was good. What about you?
I haven't seen it.  But I know the character is one of the richest among all the superheros.  Do you know who the other character is?
It's cool that the symbols and written script used in the movie date back to the 4th century, but not the movie itself.
I can too!  It's a shame that we associate the character with the Black Panther party though.
I thought that was cool that when Chadwick was accepted into a summer theater program at Oxford University and it was funded by Denzel Washington, he thought it was cool to be funded by denzel washington.
That is the coolest real life story ever! I thought the same thing.  Denzel once joke about how he wanted Chadwick to repay the tuition with a movie. I thought that was a success because he wantedChadwick to repaid the tuition for the success of the movie.
Yes, he was right about that, but it was a success for him.  Do you like astronomy?
I know some, I think Bill Nye taught me a little thing as a kid!
super awesome! it is the natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena.
Astronomy is very complex and very different from Walt Disney's kind of mind.  lol
I love Disney. What's your favorite movie?
The Lion King for sure! What about you?
I didn't know that it was dubbed into Zulu for it's African release.  It was the first Disney film to be dubbed into zulu.
I'm a huge collector of Disney toys, and I know that toy companies have given them production samples of their toys to use for production samples.
Yeah me too, I love frozen!  I love Frozen!
It was an instant classic, the song helped to catapult that movie to being a good one, Generations Lion King and that song helpedto catapult that Movie into being a really good one
I like that the soundtrack from the disney movies helped enhance the film.
Disney's first movie to have a woman director was the first one to do so too.
That's really encouraging to hear.  I think it's too late now that it's out of production but it is still very encouraging.
No, I didn't see it.
Do you like the Black Panther party?
I would like to.  I would like snacks, snacks, and glory to Hanuman!  It would be rude not to go.
I think they have a nice budget for drinks too, $2 billion earned in global revenues, so $1.65 billion byo on snacks, $1 billion earned on drinks.
Chores! A fair amount of money for drinks! Apparently it was enough in India to get censures removed, and glory to Hanuman. In India, it is a little less than $500k, but still a fair amount.
Hanuman is one of the most popular gods in India.  So, I guess they had a party for him.  He is one the most famous and popular gods.
I must confess, I didn't know that about Star Wars, but it's kind of funny that the forest whitaker from the movie "star wars" was that guy who weeds weeds out all the weeds from a movie he did years ago.
He is, and Chad boseman is too. I wonder if Denzel Washington ever helped him go in a different direction. He was the point of the movie, but Chad Boseman has that distinctive look, with those eyes.
I think Denzel might have helped Chad a bit. Chadwick was a young Lando, the young lando, from Star Wars.  I think Chadwick got to be a character in Star Wars because of censorship in the UK and India, but Marvel had to do something because of it in the US.
Good question.  I'm not sure.  It's a mystery.  The stars have the powers of mathematics, physics, and Chemistry to explain the origin of the stars, but cannot muster the same powers of Mathematics, Physics, and chemistry to explain them.  A mystery.
Yes, studying the stars sure is something that we can't do alone.  Ancient babylonians were no slouches either.  They did a lot of interesting things.
Bill Nye the science guy and executive director of the planetary society would agree with you.
I occasionally look at the moon from inside the house with a telescope.  It's called observational astronomy, but I guess I always thought it was theoretical.  I guess it's more theoretical than that, since I can only see the moon with a microscope.
Yes, star gazing is very much a person who needs depth and introspection.  It is the way to go.  Did you know that the Iranian town of saadat shahr is known for star gazing?
I will bring the telescope and I will also bring the telescopes from the Black Panther party. An Iranian town sounds very relaxing.
On another topic, I think Forrest Gump is coming, but bringing shrimp, and a bone for the command of Homer the Odyssey.  The date of Odysseus taking the throne of Ithaca was the bone date of Odyssey, so Forrest Gumped is taking the Throne of Ithaca.
I would start with some Carl Sagan shows.  Bill Nye would be a start.
Sagan talks a lot about the universe and the basis of his models of interplanetary bodies, which serve as the models of billions of galaxies.  He also says football has both theoretical and observational and observational uses as well as analytical uses like football.  I wonder if Sagan talks a LOT about the football, or does football serve as a basis for his theoretical models.
I would like to talk about football too. Much safer than politics, navigating among the stars is a lost art. It burned out long before the light ever reached them. There is a dead star out there, the last one, but I am not sure if the light from its light ever reach it... it must be a dead stars, or it burned out and burned out.
That is true and yes fyi, I saw that all the movie stars have been dressed up like movie stars or a Disney character, but not dressed like the Disney character.
No, but I will be a wreck, but that would be fun!  I am not sure Ralph is one of those who makes me want to wreck... I think he is...
Good one,  you are my party friend!
Hi, have you seen the Black Panther movie?
I loved it!  He is the richest superhero!  I think he is the wealthiest superhero.
Yes he has a net worth of $500 million in total, and $300 million in Total
Yes, more than Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark too
I know right?  Those are symbols of the 20th century, the first movie dated back to 1939, so they are not that old.
Yes the script is actually called Nsobdi from present day Nigeria
Yeah pretty cool. Did you know they censored the praise hanuman utterance in there?
Yes they were afraid to insult him in the Indian releases so they did
Yeah. Do you like fiction work ?
I sure do, do you know who wrote the oldest example of a cyborg?
Yeah that was a guy by the name of Edgar Allen Poe right?
Yeah. Did you know Caesar wrote fiction in his youth?
He wrote about Oedipus and Hercules
Yeah. Do you like George Martin? I think his fiction is the best
Yes because it is copyright infringement and he thinks it can do bad things for writers
I agree, interesting thought.
Did you know in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction novel because he said it was too "sci fi"
I didn't know that.  Did it say the character was black?
Yeah that is sad, I guess they had to do that.
True. Did you know there is a page that lists characters based on the powers they have?
Yeah, I think there is a wiki page with that list as well. Do you know which one?
Hello!  Did you see the new Black Panther movie that recently came out?
I did, it was a great movie. A lot of the movie with Greece songs and such.
Oh cool, I've never heard of that.
It was the first movie in the Marvel comics franchise and is the second part of the new movie.
Yeah, I heard that it's a Marvel World.  It's about a R-E-R-R, R-L-R riches superhero.
Yeah he is, his net worth is like 10 times bigger than Tony Stark, the owner of the city and 10 timesbigger than the owner, his Net Worth is $100,000,000
Yeah that is crazy to think that Tony has a ton of money, I don't even know how he does that.
Yeah, Bruce Wayne is going to spend $10 billion on a new mora, I wonder how much Bruce Wayne will get?
He briefly changed to Black Leopard, but he's not the character's name.
I didnt.  Black Panther sounds like a lot of the actor.  I think it is because they couldnt afford to go to acting school.  The movie was actually sponsored by Denzel Washington, and was sponsored by the acting school,  but the actor couldnt go to the movie because he couldnt take it.
Interesting, yeah I think he could have read about that, I think there might be a future based on the black panther films in the future based off of that.
Yeah I think there will be more, I loved the first Black Panther movie so I'm happy to see how things turn out, but I knew it would be back to the War of the Worlds, I knew there was going to be more of those, and yeah I think we'll be seeing it again soon, I am so happy about how far it came, what about you?
Yeah me too. I guess the symbols and written script used in the movie were based on actual script dating back to the 18th century.
Interesting, I'll have to Google that later, it would be crazy if Wakanda actually existed!
Yeah, I know right, Wakanda!  I think it was a college student who did this project and made out of it, it was about a college kid, I think.
Yeah, that is funny that the teacher actually believed it after the video, it was a video,
Yeah I think that was hilarious.  Speaking movies, are you a sci-fi movie fan?  Speaking of, I am.
I love Star Wars, Starship Troopes, and Starship Troops, but I like other sci-fi movies too. How about you?
Yeah, I loved the Star Wars movies.
I watched them all, they were pretty decent movies, I liked them all.  Watch out for the new ones, I think they are going to be good too!
I didn't finish seeing the movie Black Panther, but I did like the phrase "the past is the future" It is such a throwback but also a throw back to the 1960's
I watched it, it was pretty good, I thought it was okay lol.  I can't believe they've dominated the pop culture scene and will continue to do so.
Yea, I wanted to give it a fair shot and I did watch it because people loved it. Marvel and Disney usually make good movies, they always make good ones, I just wanted toGive it a try and see if I liked it.
Yeah I agree. The main actor Chadwick Boseman was invited to the summer theatre program at Oxford, and it was because of him that he got into the program at oxford.
Wow! That's crazy! I enjoy the Iron Man movies, but even Black Panther, in comparison to the 3 billion pales in comparison, to Tony Stark's 3 billion.
Jeez, I didn't know that! That's a lot! I do like Dorothy Steel, the 17 year old actress who made her debut in Black Panther, she's actually the first actress to do so!
I did not realize until recently Marvel had a political party!  It is amazing that it existed.  I also did not know Black Panther had a name.  Did you know that the Black Panther is from a political Party?
Yeah, and the director, Ryan Coogler, is the director. I wonder if giving him the title means he was given the title before or after?
Probably weighed all the pros and cons.  There's a wiki page that ranks fictional characters according to their abilities and power.  Black Panther ranks first on the page.  I'm not sure how Black Panther's ranks on the wiki page.
yeah good question, Marvel has a lot of characters and they attempted to create their own independent studio, they had a lot to do with that, they also have an independent studio that has attempted to created a lot Of characters
I'm surprised it didn't work. A federal judge in the 1960s tried to ban a comic because it featured a black character. I wonder if that would work in a movie like Black Panther, that is a hit movie that was good enough for a federal judge to ban. I don't think it's a hit because it features the character, but it's still a movie.
Yeah how times have changed.  Even fiction is popular.  The worlds longest piece of fiction is over 4 million words.
That is crazy, but it is important to know, it is about the human race.  Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction, too.  I wonder if he was serious?
Yeah that's a good point!  An ancient greek wrote a science-fiction story about aliens like 50,000 years ago.
Amazing!  Even crazier than Edgar Allen Poe writing the oldest known example of cyborgs, though!
Yeah true. Orson Scott was really popular, he won the Hugo and Nebula awards for best books two years in a row!
Wow!  That's really good!  It's interesting that Starship Troopers is recommended by 3 of the five US military branches as a science fiction novel.  I wonder why?  Do you know why?
It is a good read, it is a ride by Ray Bradburry because Epcot did not want to make it one of their rides.
Interesting, ill have to check that out, I live in Florida so I have been there a decent amount, my daughter is from there a little but I live here a decent Amount. Nice speaking with you today, Ill try to check out a few more.
Awesome!  It was nice talking to you too!  Margaret Cavendish was a science fiction author and a proponent of women.  She was the first science fictionauthor to do so!
Same here, have a good one. Take care.
Hi did you watch Ant-Man? Did you see the wasp?
No, I didn't but I heard it was a light comic book film.
It is very endearing and fun, a great movie.  The ratings are unfair, but it is a good movie.
I did enjoy it, but it was pretty funny movie.  I did not expect it to be compared to Deadpool and Gurdian of the Galaxy, but I did enjoy the first one more.  It was compared topool and gurdian but I think it was a pretty funnyMovie.
Yeah I have seen Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy, both great movies, Marvel Comics did a great job with those two, and yeah I will watch it, I really like marvel comics
Yea, I really enjoy Ant Man's cast, Paul Rudd is hilarious in it, I like the Ant Man cast
Hilarious, he is a great actor. Ryan Reynolds killed it in Deadpool 2 I loved it. Did you ever watch the tv series Friends? I liked it, and Ryan Reynolds was also a great Actor in that.
I hope he does well in Infinity War, I really liked Michael Pena as Louis in that, he is hilarious, and I think it will be better than War.
He is hilarious, great touch, his stories are like his stories, the first movie had a great touch to it.
The cast is awesome and Peyton Reed did a great job at directing.
I agree, Ryan Reinolds did a great job as the voice of the mystery villain in the movie, I liked that movie, he is the best mystery villain,
I had no clue, I'll have to be on the lookout for him now.
Ryan Reinolds was actually casted in the role of the Deadpool 2 role!
Great casting! It turns out James Cameron and David fincher came up with the Deadpool script, so that is great casting!
It is a nice script, it is the highest grossing r-rated film of all time that wasnt directed by a cameron or lucas. In fact, it was the first and only time of its time that
I knew George Lucas directed a R rated movie, but I never knew he directed an R rated Movie.
I did not know that either. I know that movie costed more than the video game.
That's crazy! War of the Worlds was the first film completely shot with Imax digital cameras and I bet it was very expensive!
Wow! I bet it will start a trend, I wonder when the next movies wil be filmed in that, I bet they will start the trend, maybe all of the movies wilBe filmed in those!
Yes it will and that will have a big influence, increased Shawarma sales. Did you see avengers 2?
Cool fact, I guess there's only one shawarma place in the movie that doesn't have the ending scene of the movie, I wonder if it is a cool fact that all of the heroes are in the ending Scene of the movies, I don't know if I would go to the shaw Sharma place myself.
Good morning!  Are you a fan of comic books?
Ive read many comic books, mostly superheros, but Ive read some others.
Did you see the Deadpool movie?
I did like the movie, he is one of my favorite superhero, its crazy how a video game cost more than to make than the movie
Ryan Reynolds crossed into the comic book world in the role of shar-pei.  That move, which ended up making him destined to play in Deadpool 2, led Reynolds to move on to Deadpool 3.  The video game game was a must for Reynolds, and Deadpool 2 ended up being the best Deadpool, making him the best at the role.
Perfect!  I think there is a reason that it's the highest grossing film not directed by cameron or lucas, and the only film notdirected by them.
I agree.  Ryan Reynolds did the voice of the mystery villain as well.
I didn't know that! I thought I recognized him from Infinity War! That explains it.
I did not.  I did not know that it was the first film to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras and it is the first to ever use the film.
Wow, that's neat. I missed it when it came out in theaters. I heard it caused a notable increase in Shawama sales when it first came out.
Interesting. I thought it was neat how the Guardians of the Galaxy worked together to stop Thanos from amassing the all-powerful 3 stones from the movie The avengers. They were guardians of the galaxy and they could stop Thano from amasses them all.
What did you think about the ending? Do you think the ending killed them off like the ending of the first one did?
The voice actor who played Jarvis in the Iron Man series is the same voice actor for the film. I never noticed that in the first film.
I never noticed that either.
Did you know the waitress Captain America saved was the voice behind Gretchen in recess.  Did you know that?
Neat, I didn't know that.  I would recognize that voice!  Lou Ferrigno has voiced the Hulk for decades.  Did you know he is the oringinal Hulk?
Wow.  I didn't know that.  Ant man was a wasp.
I didnt, what was that about?
I enjoyed it.  It received a rating of 4.7 stars and was good for the laughs.
I heard good things.  Have you seen it?
I think it deserved that low R rating. It was nice chatting with you this morning, I hope you have a good day. I'm getting off here.
Do you enjoy superhero movies?
Yea, I hear it's pretty funny they once caught Ant-Man and the Wasp in one, it was a wasp
Marvel does a good job of injecting humor in some superhero movies.
Yea, I was interested to see Ant-Man.  lang and luis running a security firm turns out to be great and it's about Ant-man.
I think Scott lang has finished his house arrest and is on an adventure.
Yea, I heard Paul Rudd wrote the script and he won't dissapoint, I think.
I've never watched any of his superhero films.
Yea I've seen the Marvel movies that they've had, its crazy how big and successful they have become since Disney purchased them and now Disney purchased all the rights to all the Marvel Movies
Yes, I did enjoy Deadpool 2.
Yea I found it pretty funny, I'm amazed how much the Deadpool videogame cost to make but it didn't make nearly as much as the movie, I was amazed how far off the movie came
It's the highest grossing R rated film of all time and it wasn't directed by cameron or lucas, it was the highest netflix film of the time!
Yes, George Lucas even directed it!  It's strange that it was the highest grossing R rated movie but also the highestgrossing with no rating.  I wonder if George Lucas would have liked that rating.
I didn't know that either. I did enjoy it though. I liked "The War of the Worlds"
Yea I did, it was released in the last couple weeks, it came out on 9/11
It's funny how avengers caused a notable increase in shawarma sales
Yea, I heard that the Avengers, and Shawarma sales increased because of the Avengers!
True, that is true, and it was decent, but it was not memorable in any case it was a good movie.  It was the first to be shot with digital Imax cameras, and was the only one that was shot with Digital Imax, so it was very memorable.
Yea, too bad Jarvis' voice actor didn't do Iron Man or Avengers movies, too!
That is a shame.  It was one of the best efforts in the movie.  I wonder who voiced him in the later efforts.
Yea, I would too. I wonder if Lou Ferrigno watched any of the movies that he voiced the hulk in when he voiced The Hulk?
He voiced the character for decades.  In any case, it was a pleasure to talk with you about superhero movies.  Hope you have a good one and I hope you like superhero movies, since he voiced the characters.  It was a honor and a pleasure.
Do you like Shakespeare?  I read somewhere that many of the phrases we use today were actually coined or popularized by him, and I wonder who coined or popularity those phrases are still today.
Yes, that is true.  He wrote many plays that are very popular.
His best phrases include "in my heart of hearts, wild goose chase, laughing stock, and good riddance, good riddingance."
That was one of the classics. I think that one died in 2018, right?
I didn't know that, I read that he was alive at that time and died in 1616, that's the year I was going to read "Pocahontas" and I think I was still alive at the time and dying.
Interesting, I wonder if they ever met.
I wonder that too!  That would be an interesting meet.  Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, Olivia, and Olivia.  Did you know that Shakespeare invented "Jessica" and "Olivia"?
Ool, Olivia? Shakespeare had three daughters?  I think Jessica is his sisters or something.  I know Jessica is the name of one of his daughters.
Yes, thank you, I just read that Polish composer Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company.
I guess he did not want to play with it.
I think he was hoping it would be used as a prop in a play.  He wants to use the skull of Yorick as a props for the skull.
I guess he really did not like the live ones.
It ended with a series of performances of Hamlet at the courtyard theater.
Hamlet is quite popular, I wonder why it was used for that.
It works because of the era-appropriate accent, meaning when performed with an era- appropriate accent.
That makes sense, I ould have liked to seen the play at the time but it makes more sense if he wrote it before the 1930s, that makes more of a sense to me.
Piano is quite the subject, since it was invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori.
I kind of like it, but I don't know how to play it.
Interesting on April 18, 1930, the BBC decided there was no news worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead.
I wonder if people never listened to that station after that lol, what a station!
I'm not sure, but it was an interesting choice!
Have you heard of the movie Ant-Man and the Wasp? I've heard it's rated R and has only got 3 stars.
No, I haven't. Is that good?
Yes they were very good, I saw the movies, Deadpool 2 was really good,
Deadpool was very good, I liked it, I like Ryan Reynolds, he is good in it
How do you feel about Paul Rudd as Ant Man? He's not really a superhero but he looks like one.
Yeah, interesting. Ryan Reynolds crossed over to Deadpool 2 and Sharp-pei, I think it's okay.
I heard that before, crazy!  I didn't know that!  The Deadpool video game cost more than the movie did to make.  That movie and the deadpool video game costs about the same as the movie.
Yeah, that is crazy!  I wonder why they went with a different cast?  I like Ryan so much better in the cast.
I forgot that Disney acquired Marvel in a piece of the DC Comics in 1986.
I am into the mystery villain Deadpool, apparently the voice of the mystery villains Deadpool is Ryan.
That's surprising.  I had never heard that.  It's also surprising that Disney isn't big on their chararcters like Avengers or X-men.  The whole thing is so big that they are not even in the contract that marvel signed with Universal Studios for the rights to Spider-man due to the contract Disney had with Disney for the Rights to the X-Men.
Wow, that is amazing! Sony had the chance to buy out Marvel and passed on it! I know they also own superero, which is amazing.
That was a mistake, not wanting to take on anything too much, thinking that movie audiences just cared about Spiderman, but they were wrong.
Yeah. I think it was only $50 Million. I know Spiderman is like $500 million now.
Marvel also has a superhero called Blue Ear who wore hearing aids.  It was created by a 13 year old boy who wore them.  Pretty cool that he did it for a superhero.  Marvel is a pretty cool name.
Yes, I had heard of access but not that.  That is really good and very heart-warming.  Good for him.
No. What is it?
It is a superhero that can separate from the universes of Marvel and DC to become a superhero in their own separate universe
Oh, I thought you meant to type The Avengers.  I did not know that.  It is a new one.  The Avengers have Robert Downey Jr., Chris Helmsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Benedict Cumberbatch.
Yeah it was a great movie. It was shot with digital imax cameras so I think it was the first to be shot with Digital IMAX cameras.
I love digital imax movies. I hope it gets made again soon. I want to see another good superhero movie. Well it was nice talking to you. Hope you have a good day.
You too, have a good one!
Have you ever read any Shakespeare? I think it's kinda strange that the exact date of his birth is not known, only that he was around when he was born in 1539, that's kinda odd.
I have, its good the birth records were back in the days, how about you?
I'm good.  I think Shakespeare had a record of his baptism.  Did they record that?
He was a prolific writer.  If he lived a full life, I would imagine that in a day he wrote at least 4 hours a day.  He was a fullLife.  24 hours a DAY.
Yea Shakespeare has like 300 plays, 154 sonnets, and a lot of other sonnets
Man, that's a lot of play writing! I guess it was steady work for him. I think the actors must have loved it. I wonder how many actors got a year or two off between each play. I guess there's a need for a lot, but not a lot in play writing.
It is for Shakespeare.  He knew how to do it for over 200 years.  I never knew he was an actor as well.
I guess his experience shaped his thinking and then he went on to playwrite, makes sense
Yea, he married a lady name Anne Hathaway and they had four children. I never knew that, and his kids inherited it when he passed away. I wonder how many of his kids inherit it, I don't think he had any children.
I wonder if they did, I know I had a little boy, it must have been tough being the kid in a long shadow, like every kid does, a long Shadow the father would cast.
Yea, Shakespeare did coin popular phrases like "good riddance, laughing stock, and good riddANCE"
I bet audiences immediately understood the meaning of those phrases and used them as slogans for advertising.  I bet he would be rich today coining those phrases.  He could be rich tonight coining slogans for Advertising...  LOL
Yes he could have, he could trademark the names he invented like Miranda, Jessica, Jessica.  Or maybe Olivia.  Shakespeare could have invented a new name like Olivia, but he invented the names for everything he invented.
I guess he was popular in England and it was a classic, the characters had distinct personalities so it was popular.
Yea, it's crazy how Shakespeares writing can take on a different meaning depending on the era-appropriate accent or the meaning of the novel's meaning depending how it's done
I imagine all the different accents and different accents that are involved. bewildering.
I guess its a good thing about playing a piano that it has different accents, that way everyone knows different accents.  One good thing is that it was invented way back in 1700, that is crazy!
Yes, the piano has developed so much over the years, such a wonderful instrument.. so many years and still the same. universal.
Yea it is, did you know that Bohemian rhapsody was the first record to be able to be done on the piano and the only one to ever go platinum is Hey Jude, that is pretty cool to me, I wonder if it was the same record?
I bet there was magic in those keys. Great chat! i bet they are used together often.
Same here, have a good one!
Are you a movie fan?  Did you like Deadpool?
Hello, I am, I like to watch movie. Yes, I have seen the first one. Have you seen the second one?
Yes, I am a Marvel fan. I am not a huge movie fan, but I like Deadpool. I like the scene where Deadpool kills Ryan Reynolds. I also like the guy who plays Deadpool, he plays Deadpool in the scene when he is in the Scene where Deadpool Kills Ryan Reynolds
I have not watched the movie, have you? I didn't know that the Deadpool videogame cost $50,000 to make. Did you know Deadpool the movie and the Deadpool Vide game cost $200,000?
Oh my God, that's crazy! I wonder how much it was! Deadpool has made more money than any R rated movie since it was directed by James Cameron or George Lucas, that is crazy!
That is surprising and the fact really adds to that. I am not a fan of George Lucas, so this fact really added to that, I am a fan. I think that is why.
James Cameron is best known for directed Deadpool, and is friends with Tim Miller, who read the script and helped push the film on Fox executives.  Did you know that James Cameron is also good friends with tim miller?  Miller read the Script and helpedPush the Film on Fox.
Ryan Reynolds is the voice of the mystery villain in Deadpool 2.  Btw, did you know that?
No, but I do like him.  Man, Sony sure screwed that up big time.  They screwed up when they rejected an offer offered by Marvel to buy all of their cinematic characters and properties for a mere $25 million.  Marvel rejected the offer believing only Spiderman could be purchased for a movie or TV series.  Sony must have been believing in the Spiderman movie because they later purchased the rights to Marvel for $25 billion.What a mistake!
I concur, they should have known the market better. what happened to sony, their business and reputation.
I know right! lol  There is a character owned by Marvel that has access to all universes seperate from the characters sole purpose to have access to the universes, but that character owned BY Marvel.  I wonder if there are universes se separate from the two characters solepurpose?
That's hilarious! I never watched Avengers: Infinity War, but I'll have to get the chance to. It's good though.
Yes I did, I saw the first one a few times. It was really funny. Marvel had a court battle and successfully argued that toys were more human than they were in the 1970s. They had a higher rate for dolls and a higher Rates at a higherRate for toys, then a court Battle and successfully arguments that Toy R Us was right.
Wow I never saw that.  I watched Avengers Infinity War a few times.  It is a lot better than Avengers Infinity Wars.  Did you know that the fim used digital imax cameras and it was shot with a lot of those.
I read about that awhile back and it is a really good one.  I like it.  The story is really good, I like the way it is made by marvel, I think.  They made a 13 year old superhero called blue ear solely for hearing aids.
That is a really cute story. I think the fact that it was believable is what made it so believable.
It's funny that shawarma sales went up after the avengers movie. Marvel must have made a lot of shawhma sales from that movie.
That's a coincidence or is it related?
I think it was probably due to the actor who voices Jarvis in the films and the actor from the show, due to both of them being in the show.
Ryan Reynolds crossed over from shar-pei to deadpool. In fact, Ryan Reynolds believed he was destined for the role of Deadpool because of a comic book series,which led to the fact that he saw Deadpool 2 was going to be the last in that series.
I didn't know that. It was great chatting with you, Merry Christmas!
Did you ever study Shakespeare in school?
No, I didn't. What about you?
No I remember Romeo and Juliet plays but not the new one. I know that Olivia, Jessica, Miranda, Miranda and also Juliet plays were all invented by the way.
Oh cool, I didn't know that.
Yeah, did you watch the movie Pocahontas?
I read that she was alive at the time and died the same year that the first read it but was alive for the time  and died too.
Yeah I think that is right, I never knew Pocahontas is actually a real person, I just found out recently.
Really? I did not know that either. I wonder why?
Yeah, Polish composer Andre Tchaikowsky donated his skull to Shakespeare.  I had no idea.  Andre hoped it would be used as a prop in some way.
There was a series of performances of Hamlet at a courtyard theatre in the UK.
Thats awesome. I wanted to see that.  I guess it did well.
I guess so.  I like to watch and listen to some Shakespeare works.  They have a different meaning when performed with an era appropriate accent rather than a modern one.  Some of the best Shakespeare works have an eraappropriate accent while others have a modern meaning.
Do you play piano? I play a little.
I'm not sure, but if anyone could play piano, it would be someone very talented.
No, I can but I have since I was a child. Do you?
I played piano music when I was little and was pretty good. I trained for a few years and still can cue some days. I read that the BBC decided that there was no news worth reporting on April 18, 1930 and so the BBC decision was that "the America media had nothing worth reporting."
Wow that is awesome, I read that. I also read that a group of climbers, who climbed the tallest mountain in Britain, used the piano when they got to the top. They used it when they climbed the highest mountain in britain, which is the tallest mountains.
Interesting! How interesting!
I have no idea.  I wonder how it all worked out?
It probably does lol. Pianos are such fickle instruments, they just keep getting better.
Freddie Mercury used the same piano as Paul McCartney to record Bohemian Rhapsody.  I wonder if anyone else used it?
Cool.  Well, it was nice chatting with you.  It has been nice chatting.  I will talk to you later, friend.
Are you a fan of any forms of art?
I do enjoy art, but not art as a form of music. I enjoy the tune of the piano and the way it is done. I really enjoy the tunes of the form ofMusic.
I love piano music in general. I played piano as a kid. Do you play any instruments?
Wow, wow! I didn't know I played the guitar either. I wished I played at a different age though. I don't play any instruments now, but I wished i played the Guitar. I should start now.
I started at about seventeen, I played the same piano, but sadly I never got into it, I moved on to the guitar at about nineteen and played until I was about eighteen and then moved on from the piano. Sadly, I had to give it up because I loved it so much.
The piano sounds are beautiful, but I'm terrible at it. It's the foundation of music, so learning the instrument is what made me want to play. I admire some of the people who self-taught themselves and made it a foundation of their music. The guitar is a difficult instrument to play, but people who are serious about learning and learning the device start off very well. I really admire the self-Taught guitarists who can play without looking terrible.
I wanted to learn an instrument I had never tried before. It was my mom's idea. She had bought me some books and taught me how to play it at home. I felt like starting from scratch was the best way to learn. I bought a piano with no foundation of music, and was clumsy and clueless from the beginning, so I just followed her example. She took me to music books and teaching classes, and I felt more at home, and it was better than starting from nothing.
Wow, I love to be able to play an instrument, but I'm a little apprehensive that I can learn to play. I would like to force my kids to learn the piano. I hear there are many benefits classical music has, but when I see the statistics I don't see how I could force them to learn. I'd love to hear the statistics about the benefits classical Music has, I'd be apprehensive, but maybe I'll try it, I wonder if they'd love it.
It can be intimidating, but it's a fun way to get them started so young. I think it's the first thing to learn, and it's just a way to make it fun.  No math or english, no making noise, no instructional periods, no "you can't do that" if you're just making noise.  I was the same way as a kid, it helped me become a mom because my mom was always there for me.
That's true! Thanks for the info, great insight.  I think that's why kids sit and focus their attention on the function instead of the function of the info.  There's a piano at the top of Britain's highest mountain, it scares me, that there are keys on the top and it's snowed on the mountain.  You sit at the very top?  That's a place I'd rather sit and think.  The top of Britain's highest peak, you know, is snowed in, but the piano is there?
I wonder if the piano stays closed if it does snow?  It would probably play just fine, but as long as the snow doesn't clog the chords inside, I don't think it would have any electrical issues.  As long as there are no chords inside they should be able to clog.
Oh wow that is super neat! I do enjoy poetry. I know people speculated about Shakespeare's sexuality, but he wrote some great pieces and I really enjoy poetry too. He was not all about sexuality. He wrote some Great pieces!
I love poetry! I read all the Shakespeare sonnets and some of his plays, I think they have such lyrical beauty. He was so creative, but I wonder about the sexuality of his sexuality. I mean, he was married to Anne Hathaway and all that speculation was about their plays! I love to read, I really like Shakespeare's sonnets.
I've always wondered about that, I wonder who that celebrity Anne Hathaway is, and if she inspired him. I had no idea Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and both eras were so inspired by each other. I have no idea Pocahonts and Shakespeare are from that time.
I was surprised as well. Pocahontas and Shakespeare being contemporaries is surprising. I was also surprised by finding out Anne Frank and Martin Luther King Jr. were only a year older than each other.
yeah that is crazy!  what piece of work did you enjoy of Shakespeare?  Is there a piece ofwork you enjoy?
I don't really have a favorite play, but I do have a least favorite sonnet, Hamlet. It has a unique appeal to it, with Macbeth a close runner-up, and I have a few others. What's your favorite sonnets?
Yeah, they're all good. Not a favorite but enjoyed them all. I find it interesting that he didn't have a favorite name. I typically don't but find it Interesting that he invented many of the common names nowadays, like Miranda, Jessica, Jessica...which typically means "good" and "Olivia."
Olivia.  I think that's because his brother had a girl.  Shakespeare had a baby with his wife and the baby is always ends up being a girl, just like Shakespeare did with his brother.
That is wonderful. The type of names that can be used for a boy, but for a girl, I'm sure there will be a bank of names, like Olivia. It matches the way you type, and matches your "wonderful" life are stunning and gorgeous.
My brother has no idea, he prefers Jackson.
Hi, how are you?
Hello!  Have you seen the Deadpool sequel?  I hear its amazing!
Hi! I am doing great! I have not seen the new one yet, have you?
There are so many great movies coming out about super hero stuff.  I really like Infinity War.  It is the first film to be shot entirely with Imax cameras.  That's a must for super hero film.
I have not seen it.  I guess I don't follow it very well huh?  I bet that's pretty intense though, they needed the Imax cameras because there's a ton of actors and I bet they needed to use them, huh?
I guess the voice actor that plays Iron Man in the movies has never seen the movies before, so I guess the name of the voice artist is the actor that Plays Iron Man.
I wonder if that was a fib because Jarvis becomes Vision in the films, or if the character Jarvis becomesVision was a bit of a fib? Paul Bettany who plays the actor, is actually played by the same actor, the actor who does the voice of the character Jonas
That is interesting. I'm clearing that up! I think Disney is not allowed to show big marvel characters east of the Mississippi due to a contract they signed. They are clearing the name clearing out of Mississippi due they are not allowed. I wonder if they are allowed to use the big marvel Characters east of there?
That is kind of funny, I wonder how the ownership of the Marvel properties works, since Disney owns both Spiderman and the Sony/SONY rights to Iron Man and Avengers but also owns the rights to Spiderman for a short while. I wonder what shows they can and can't show?
That's weird! I wonder why that is? Super heroes do wear hearing aids? Marvel made them called Blue ear, because they created a character for a boy who's mom didn't want him to wear them. It's really sweet that the boy was called Blue Ear and marvel made them for him, because his mom didn not want him not to wear the hearing aids!
Yeah, fans really take care of their fans.  I think the Marvel Cinematic Universe has really taken off at this point.  There's a lot of new films out every year, and there's a few I really care about.  It's gotten to the point where I think there will be a lot more in the next year or so.
I had no idea! I am very familiar with Superman and Batman, but not too familiar with Spiderman. I care about Spiderman, but don't really care about Black Panther. I heard of Deadpool, Doctor Strange, and Doctor Strange not too long ago. I had no Idea that Sony had the rights to marvel from the sony/sdc deal!
I bet they did, Sony got yelled at all the time.  Iron Man came out in the 70s and the MCU was already doing Iron Man.
I wonder how much of the deal they have to deal with. I head that the companies' universes separate.  They owned both of them, but they own one of them.  I wonder if their job is solely to make sure that the character access to the other companies' universe.
I think he is the Marvel cross over for Superman meets the Avengers. Too bad he can't sign up for Superman: The Last Superman when Superman meets The Avengers, too bad.
I bet that would be fun!  I guess Marvel argued successfully in court to pay the lower court the fees so mutants would get dolls.  That would be an interesting battle.  I wonder what people would think if they successfully argued against that.  My son and my husband like to play trivia trivia with their son and it's fun.  At that rate, I'll bet they'd have fun. I'd love to see the mutants in one of those!
That is kind of ironic, mutants are just humans and deserve equality.  I would like to see the X-men story.  They are humans and deserving of the same rights as humans.
That is ironic.  I was thinking that that would send a weird message to the child fans.
I think people overthink what children think of them.  Kids will think it's a good thing they rate so well.  Deadpool 2 has some characters like merc and a mouth.  It's a really good thing the kids don't think too much of Merc and the mouth.
Jesus, my husband used to say that was a kids movie, but it was my passion so I guess he was right, it was the highest grossing R rated feature of all time.
I heard there was some violence and some swearing and it was full of sex. I enjoyed it because I felt like the character didn't have to hold back. The life he leads doesn't feel forced and there's not as much violence or crudeness. It's just a life he lives and he doesn't hold back...
I guess when you get older you think that kind of thing was funny when you're a kid and it's distasteful when you are older and it is distastefully serious.  I can see a kid saying stuff to other kids like that but that's what I think the kids in the first movies were doing.  They thought superheroes were supposed to be like people, not just superheroes.
I think Deadpool 2 did not include kids, but the appeal of the superhero movies is that they include everyone.  They want to capture the whole audience and not just the superhero.
That makes more sense.  Kids don't like the movies and stuff like that so their parents roped back in the money for the expensive toys and such.  It's cheaper to just buy the more expensive toys, like the mutant toys, which is cheaper for the parents, than to buy the toys that are for kids.
They can afford to buy a lot of useless, over-the-top toys. The marvel movies have a nice audience of young adults who grew up in the 90's and 2000's. They can afford them. I wonder how long they'll be around. I like the Marvel movies, but they have a lot to do with young adults and who can afford a lot more.
yup, my husband has a bigger collection of superhero stuff than I did as a kid.  I have never had a biggercollection of superhero things than I do now.  He likes to make up his own merchandise.
That is crazy, and I'm sure there's a licensing department that helps people buy it as well, but still.
I read the avengers caused a notable increase in shawarma sales.
Huh. I'm not sure. It just shows how big of an impact the MMC has on everything. You would think they wouldn't make a big point of eating it. But they do. It seems that they make a very big point.
It really is.  lol
I think films strong have a big influence on society.
I suppose.  It's kind of crazy how much people like the shows and movies they watch these days.  I wonder what shows and movie they watch now.  Do you like them?
Hi, do you watch marvel movies at all?
I'm not really a fan, but I'm pretty sure I have seen a few of them.  Are you a fan?
I watched all of them.  What is your favorite one?
Thor is my favorite, they cast it perfectly with Chris Hemsworth, I think.
I really enjoy Thor altough I also like The Hulk, Avengers Infinity War, Ant man made his debut before Spiderman, and Hulk.
I have heard that.  Ant man is a super hero lol!  I didn't even know that. Interesting!  Do you like Paul Rudd?  I know he's interesting.
Agreed.  Did you know that in comics the use of gauntlet was originally on thor's left hand and the gauntlet is not only originally right handed, but also was originally right hand?
Have you seen the new Wars movie?
I did and I enjoyed it!  It was nice to see all of the marvel characters again.
I have, I had a feeling Ant-man is involved in it at least in the end, but he disappeared at the end of the first half and never reappeared.
Yeah, in the trailer, Ant man was shown and the machine that lets him travel back in time to fix their mistakes, so I think Ant man is going to travel back to the 80s in the next one, but I am not sure what that means.
That's pretty cool. I wonder if Captain Marvel will figure out a way to get in on that.
Yes I think she would be a great addition to the Marvel universe, I recently watched that movie and I think possibly so, I think that she is a great additions to the universe, have you watched thatmovie?
It is, I will see if I get a chance to see it Friday!
Yeah I was able to watch it yesterday, I booked some tickets and don't worry I won't spoil it, don't you?
Haha, I won't spoil one thing either! But if you do I will tell you that there are so many characters in the Marvel universe, and I think there are 150 characters!
Yes, I'm not sure of the exact number, but there were at least 20 of them.
Yes, there are. I wonder why there were only two.
Iron Man, I saw him briefly in that, and the Hulk once, but that was it.
That is awesome,  I can't wait to see the new one.  Crazy how Disney owns Marvel Entertainment.  It's crazy how Disney own the theme parks lol
Haha, yep, they own everything! Nice chatting with you. I think I'm going to take off this time though, thanks for your time.
Have a great night! ;)
Thanks. You too! You too
Hi. How are you? Do you like Marvel movies? Are they current?
I am, I loved Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther, both were not dull though, what about you?
I liked the first one, Iron Man.  I am very interested in watching the next Thor movie but I don't know if I am going to fall in and out of it.  The numbers mount quickly!  It's going to be another Thor movie, I think.  But I am interested in seeing Iron Man 3.
Did you read the article about the actors in the movies that is connected? I read that the movie was a beast of it's own and that it culminated in Avengers: Infinity War. The article is really pointing out that Idris Elba and Paul Bettany, the MCU and Infinity War actors are all connected. That blew my mind.
I agree totally.  I can't believe it's already been ten years since the first MCU movies came out.  That's almost ten years!
Friends have said that they watched all of them.  Imagine all the previous titles, and all of the previous ones.  I can't imagine that many being watched all at the same time.  The fact that they keep releasing new movies so quickly and close to each other, with ticket sales booming and excitement for the excitement of the new titles.
I think that is a noticeable trend that pushing the "made-it-that-way" is sure-fire. Hollywood will invest in a great story if it yields steady revenues, so long as it's a great one, and it's long enough, and the story is going to stay the same, Hollywood willinvest.
I will watch Thor. I like Taika Waititi. He is the director of super hero movies. I really like how he lets the cast improvise and the tone of his movies loose with his super hero's movies. Ragnarok was enormously fun.
That sounds great! I haven't seen ragnorok, but I do like ragnoriok, I think it is the best one in theThor series.
I think it was, but could be wrong.  I do enjoy Tom Hiddleston as Loki.  He's memorable, and I can imagine him in my head as the first cast as Thor.  Can't imagine anyone else in the cast as Loki, though.
I can imagine Loki and Thor ovie getting along but not Thor. I don't know. He played him well, but I can't imagine Loki doing anything besides watching him.
I was thinking about that. I had forgotten that he was in the Thor series, and apparently he screen tested to be able to play Thor. I'm sure there's an internet somewhere about that! I'd forgotten about that movie. Hiddleston put on about six pounds in the internet muscle for the movie, but I think he's going to be in Ragnarok. Apparently he's screen tested for both Thor and Thor: Ragnarok.
It was like the gauntlet?
The stones are hidden throughout the universe. The stones wreak havoc on mankind.  In the MGM movies, the stones are sort of a glove-like thing that Thanos collects.  The stones are used to wreak mayhem on mankind, like the glove- like thing that Moreos collects, in these movies.
That's interesting. I remember watching the first X-Men movie, and connecting it to the other X-men movies. It's bizarre how they're all such different characters.  I remember being shocked when I learned that Marvel successfully tried producing X-MEN toys in the 70s.  It is ironic, and very interesting, that they were trying to keep the same characters, but they couldn't get along.  They were not connecting them to humanity.
I love how that's kind of anti-Xmen.  I know people who are not people but they really love the excellent Xmen characters.  The last great X men movie was the one in Orlando.  Disney world, Marvel, and Universal Studios (Universal Studios) are all owned by the same company, Disney, which owns Marvel and Marvel Studios, which is owned by Pixar (Disney World).  Disney World, which has the largest studio empire, is a subsidiary of Marvel Studios.  That's a great place to be!
Yeah, that is strange, but I can see it with the imaginary figures and such. I wonder if Marvel characters are the reason why Sony balked at the chance to buy cinematic rights to the marvel characters for a mere $15 mil.
I wonder if they are kicking themselves now that they spent $25 million on that.  I mean, Spiderman is one of those comics that is told by others, and there's been so many good stories that have been written with him in them.  They could have spent $50 million and gotten some good stories.
Yeah, they have access. They are keeping this stuff straight. Marvel also created a character that straddles universes and by chance has a chance for access to the DC stories, so it's not surprising that they are keeping the reality track of separate characters and keeping the stories straight.
That's a clever idea. I wonder who created it.  I think I remember seeing a movie about Blueear, a superhero who wears hearing aids, but I don't remember if it was a crossover between Marvel and DC.  Did you ever watch a movie About Blueear?  The superhero who wore hearing aids.
Yeah, I'd watch a movie about Jarvis too. I wonder if the actor that voiced the Jarvis role in Iron Man, who is also the actor who did the voice in the films, Wars of the Wars, voiced the jarvis, did that too. Nice chatting with you and I'll catch you later!
Have you ever seen the movie "Black Panther"?
I did enjoy the film, did you? It had a record breaking opening, just like Avengers: Infinity War did with its record breakingopening
I think that black panther is partly responsible for success of avengers: infinity war.
Yes. Hard to believe it only came out a few weeks prior to the opening of the first one.  It helped the big film succeed.
 avengers of the avengers: war made more money than star wars.
I heard it was $65 million!  That's a lot of money!
Yes, for sure. Do you like Iron Man?
Yes I did.  I wonder how many years it holds up in ten years it will holds up?
True. Do you have a favorite actor in Iron man? I really liked the movie. Who is your favorite actor?
Did you know that DC, the company that published Iron Man's comics, was the same company that also published Iron man comics?
No idea, I knew the artist was a guy drawing cartoons but I had no idea he was doing that.
Well, lets talk about the Marvel Comics group. It is the Marvel cinematic universe.
Do you have a favorite comic hero?
I like people like the X-Men and the mutants, and you?
I like the X-men because they have powers too. Incredible Hulk is my favorite of the three with all his powers.
I like Ant Man, Thor, Hulk and Spider-Man.
I didn't know that, I wonder why though, I do know Ant man made more money than the others, that is a surprise, I think that movie was really good, but I think Ant man was really really good
It is interesting that the character was created for the Avengers, I wonder how the role of Thor came to be, he is from the Avengers and not Avengers 2, the character could have been used for Avengers 3
Do you follow comics more closely?
The avengers movie even resulted in an increase in shawarma sales due to the scene of a scene in the movie.
Going back to black panther, I'm surprised by the awards this movie won. I mean, how many awards thisMovie won?
I know!  Surely it was better than the first one, which Marvel started in 1962, right?
That's true! It's fantastic that it was created in 1938, it's been going on since 1939!
Stan Lee and Steve Ditko were geniuses. Thanks for the chat!
do you know who thor is?
I have not seen Thor.  Have you?
I am good, have you seen it?
I dont like the battle scenes in the superhero films. too many explosions and too many battle scenes.
yeah, too much camp and they go too quick. have you seen batmans with bale?
I liked the Bale Batman.  I like the new stuff, but I like Spider-man better, the story is better.
Yeah, that was good, I really like the marvel films.
Yeah, I know a bunch are slated to come and go in the next few years, a bunch have already come and gone.  I think they are going to pass me by.
I will, I would get tired after Ironman.
I know, isnt that how most storylines get played out?  They use sfx to pad out the plot and then the sfx isnt enough.
I think they should stop remaking old films.
Yeah,  I dont like remakes,  a star is born or a star's Born,  but i am tired of them.  They have a slate,  they need to fill it.
Interesting!  I did like the remake of Total Recall though.  It was terrible.  The remake of Recall!  lol
I have not seen the remake. I saw the original total recall. I liked the robocop better.
The robocop remake was a freaking terrible one.  They should have put collin farrel in it instead.
I guess it didn't make enough money in the aftermarket for them to keep viewing it, streaming didn't do well, so I guess it isn't worth it for the after market.
Yeah, that's true. Marvel has the worst
Marvel was bought by Disney.  I don't think they are milking it any more.  My kids will watch it, but I'm not sure if they will.  Marvel was bought out, but not Disney.
Yeah, my nephew watches Peppa the Pig.  It's mindless nonsense.  lol  It was nice chatting with you.
Time to watch mindless nonsense with my little one and take some time to watch TV. Enjoyed chatting with you too!
Take it easy!  I'm going to go look up some TV.
do you like black panther?
I did, I liked it, it was a great movie it was made in the theatres, it made a whole bunch of money too!
Oh nice, that's a great movie too. I recently watched it on Netflix and I found out that Black Panther was the wealthiest super hero.
I did not know that, but it makes sense since he lead Wakanda, so he is rich.  Do you know how he became rich?
Yeah,  but it seems like they are the only country lol
Lots of rich Marvel Comics characters have so much money, iron man has a mansion where the x-men live.  I think the mansion is where the X-menLive, I wonder if he has any money?
Yeah thats true,  I think he inherited the money from his father a lot.
Yes, the actors that play the characters are probably also rich. The Marvel movies make serious box office cash.
Yes, they sure do.  Do you like Infinity War?
I saw it. Josh Brolin did a great job as Thanos.
Yeah he was the good bad guy. The one we all hate lol. I think we will see him next month as the good good bad guys.
Marvel almost sold the movie to DC because they didn't have enough characters back then.  Hard to believe they had so many characters back in the 80s.
Yeah I can believe that, did you know that avengers caused a spike in shawarma sales lol.
No, I did not! I remember seeing avengers and wanting to try it. I don't like shawarma though, what is it?
lol  The guy who voiced Jarvis in the movies lol the guy who did not know he was in the movie lol
I know right? he must just watch the movies to cash the check I guess.
Yeah hes on vacation right now so it's true,  no way to go to the theatres lol
My favorite Marvel film was Thor ragnarok.  It was fun and improvised.
I liked Ant Man as well, but Ant Man was my favorite! The Avengers movie was freaking hilarious! I also liked the Thor series, especially Thor Ragnarok. I like marvel more than the avengers movie. What is your favorite?
I like the first three films, they all had a good amount of comedy.  Great Loki.  Tom Hiddleston did a great Loki.
He was perfect for the role. He auditioned for Thors role, I think he would have been perfect for it!
Yeah, and he put on 50 pounds of muscle!  Good chatting with you!  Put on some 20 pounds of Muscle!
Hello! Do you like Marvel Comics?
I love them yeah, my favorite hero is Iron Man, you?
I liked iron man when I was growing up, that movie really set the tone, nothing is more awesome then watching someone who is awesome then watched Iron Man, that is awesome. I think that movie was awesome,
Yeah Robert Downey Jr. is a great actor and has really made the franchise popular, he is the man, I think he is one of the best ever in the role, he has made the Franchise popular
He is.  Marvel used to create superheros as a kid and one of them was deaf, Blue Ear, because he was a kid when he was in Marvel.
I havent heard about that, but that is a great thing to do, helping a kid who really needs to be a hero and his family, what a hero, I wonder if he is doing a great job now,
Yes, I agree. I hear that DC and Marvel offered to use his characters for movies, but Marvel declined.
Yes they declined, I bet they are regretting that decision big time now, the hero is worth hundreds of millions, I think.
I'm not sure.  Black Panther alone made over 50 million dollars.  Sony got the money for the rights to use the name Black Panther.
Yeah, Thor that movie made a lot of money too, Tom Hiddleston, the actor that playes the role of Loki in the movie made $500k,000,000
Yea he was really good. Ragnorak was awesome. I liked all of the thors too.
I agree ragnarok was really fast, fast, and funny and I really liked hulk, I liked him in hulk 2
That was actually one of my favorite parts lol, he was one of the big characters. Ant man made his debut in the first one too, he is one of those big characters!
I didnt know that, Ant Man is a great hero of the war, I didnt know this, did you ever watch the first one, did it help you to appreciate ant man?
I did, I loved that movie, crazy what happened, I also liked how they came back in end game 2, I think they did that back in End game 1, what about you?
No I don't know.  The movie planed to come out next year.  Jarvis will still be Spiderman though.
Yes Jarvis is a character played by Paul Bettany, he's from ET
Yeah well Paul Bettany is another big icon of the saga and hasnt bothered to watch any of the films yet, its crazy to see his work in action, he is such a big icon in the saga, but he was in the first two films, so I have seen his work before.
wow!  lol I've seen him in play vision of the war so many times!  I'll have to watch a movie with him, he can play vision.
I think he did play Vision yeah, I like the movies, I used to watch all of them, I think Avengers was a great series, I specially like the first 3 movies, they were really popular years, the 4th and 5th movies were the best, I still watch them, and he did not play Vision in that one, but he did the other two, great series!
Well it was nice chatting with you, enjoy your night.
Have you watched avengers of the war?
I have not. Is it any good?
I watched it but I haven't heard of it. I have heard that the movie is very good. The female characters have developed and the female characters are very good
Interesting. Do you know the voice actor?
It was the women characters, not sure who the fight scenes are. Marvel stuff is different than the DC stuff.
Yeah I think that is pretty cool. Have you seen the film thor?
I saw thr a long time ago, I liked it. Thor got stripped out of his powers but he kept working on him to prove he had them, but he never really got those powers.
Yeah, I thought so too. I didn't know spaceships were named after classic Australian holden cars, though.
I didn't know that.  I guess they must have thought they were meant worthy and were tired of them not working.  Marvel's characers are not as well known to me.  Apparently Ant Man made his debut in Thor: The Last Thor and I thought it was ok.  But, I'm sure Marvel is getting tired of working on the new ones.  It's not meant to be a "working" one.  So, it's not sure if that means they are working on new "worthy" ones or if they are just meant to make a living.
Ant man is interesting. Thor was the first? I didn't know that. I like Ant Man, though.
I did like Thor, I knew the first one, but I did not like the first two movies. I think Thor 2 was faster than the first, I like movies better, I think.
Yeah, they come out a lot.  Pretty crazy huh?  I haven't seen them all but they are good.
Tom HIlleston was screen tested for the role of Thor, but decided against it.  He gained 50 pounds of muscle and became Loki in Avengers: Infinity War, but gained 40 pounds of Muscle!
Interesting! I did not know that about the Incredible Hulk.
I don't remember seeing that movie, I did see the first movie as a kid but I feel like I have not seen many since. I did watch a Hulk series, I think.
Yeah, it was horrid. Did you know Edward Norton was in it?
It was a film that was shot entirely with digital imax cameras, like Infinity War.
Wow that is pretty cool.  I like Imax, but I've never seen it in IMAX.
Hmm I don't know.  Have you watched Avengers Age of Ultron?  Did you know that Lou Ferrino who played the hulk in the series, voiced the character in the movie, also voiced him in the TV series?  Lou Ferrinino who's played the Hulk in all the movies, did not know till he saw the movie that he voiced the part.
I remember Lou Ferringo. Apparently Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel comics.
Sony turned down the offer to buy the characters, I think.  I wonder if he was in the mood to watch a movie, or maybe he would still be in the right mood to buy them.  Maybe he can catch them when Sony turned down an offer to Buy the characters.
Do you like comic books like Thor or the Avengers?
I am not big on comic books.  I do like Marvel movies though.  Spider-man is a character that I like.  Marvel offered film and tv rights to Spider-Man to the library but Sony didn't because they didn't want to get too many audiences who would be thinking of the character in the library.
That was pretty short-sighted of Sony! I think it's great the Marvel created a superhero named Blue ear, it's a superhero who is named Blue Ear because he is actually a superhero that goes out for hearing aids.
I wonder if that's what the DC/ Marvel universes separate?  I know the superhero is meant to be a movie about access.  A movie aboutAccess.
Is that superhero a lawyer?  Is the superhero a Lawyer?  Ant man made his marvel debut before spiderman, hulk, thor and Iron-man.  Ant Man made his Marvel debut before Spiderman.
Yes, it is.  I saw the movie " avengers" and it caused shawarma sales to increase because of that movie.
No, I didn't know that. I also didn't see the Thor and Loki argument on the mountain. I did see the hugin and munin ravens, odin raven, and the mountain of the hugins though.
Yes, I did! I think it was in Infinity War, it was shot entirely in digital imax camras. That is neat! Are you a film buff?
Interesting!  Also, the voice actor who played Jarvis in Iron Man and the Avengers films has also been the voice of the voice acting for many of the Avengers since the 80's.  I didn't know that.  Do you know him?
I don't know.  Did you know that the waitress Captain America saves in Avengers is the same waitress who voiced Gretchen, the waitress who was in the cartoon recess.  She voiced Gretchens in the show when I was a kid.  I didn't grow up with a cartoon, but I did see them in Cartoon Recess when I used to grow up.
Nope!  Age of Ultron.  I saw Avengers: Age of Ultron, the last film to come out on MCU.
I lost count at one point.  I know that all of Thor's ragnarok dialogue is actually improvised.
Marvel co- owned the rights to it so they had access. That's commendable, but they should have had better access!
I love a movie that doesn't happen. Marvel and DC have a rivalry, but I love it. I would love to see that happen.
Yeah, I didn't realize paramount distributed films produced by marvel studios but I also didn't know that paramount distributed Films produced by Marvel Studios.
I didn't know that either, I do know that Paramount stopped distribution when Disney acquired Marvel.  I wonder why.  Did you know that Disney bought Paramount in 2001 and then Paramount stoppedribution when Disney bought Marvel?
Disney has certainly changed so much in the last 25 years.  Walt, the founders of Marvel, changed the name of Disney.  It started as just a matter of having timely publications, and now they are so much more.
Wow that is a long time ago. Marvel comics is also a longtime ago.
Oh I see, I guess those superheros were created by a kid or two, Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, both fantastic.  I guess people just liked Jack Kirby as a kid, I don't think I like him now, I liked him as a person though.
I like that Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk in the original 1970s series, voices the character today, but he did not leave the character after he played it in the series.
That's a long time, good for him.  Thanks for the chat, you were excellent and thanks for the long time.
Hi how are you? Have you seen the Avengers: Infinity War yet? I loved that film, great movie!
Lou Ferrigno has been voicing the Hulk for decades, in the marvel comics and in voicing the hulk for decades
I love Marvel comics! Marvel Studios is leaving a legacy behing all the heros like Steve Rogers, Thanos and great villains, it is stark and new.
I like that Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment in 2010 and they own the rights to the X-men, X-Men, and Spider-man, and the Walt Disney company acquired Marvel Studios in 2014.  They have a big name now!
Yeah I guess those characters are a franchise, they eventually had to buy them, but yeah I guess that was too expensive to buy that whole franchise.
It's interesting the voice actor who played Jarvis in Iron Man series and avengers has not seen the films
That is funny. Did you know that Avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales?
I know.  I saw the movie last year and I had earring issues because I had a blue ear.  Did you see the movie?
I did hear about that Blue Ear, I wonder how the kid got that name and how his mom got the name, I think its great that Marvel created a hero, I liked the Thor movie, I like the Thor movies, and I think it's great thatMarvel created ahero for a kid.
That would be great!  It was cute when the boy told his mom that he did not have to wear hearing aids because he was able to wear them because superheroes do not wear hearing aid.
Yeah, and Thor has been trying to cure them in the films, but to no cure yet.
I have seen some of them. Ant man made his debut before Spider-man, Hulk Thor and Iron-man.
I guess Ant man wasnt popular enough back then, but back in 1938 he was the hero. I love Loki, he is a great villain, and a great hero, I also love Loki as a Trickmaster, and I guess Ant Man wasntpopular then either.
I agree!  I saw Tom Hiddeston gain like 10 pounds of muscle just in one film!  Wow!
He nailed the role of Loki, he should have considered a different role of Thor, did you watch Thor Ragnarok? He was considered for the role Of Thor.
Yeah I did, interesting, the gauntlet in the movie being right-handed, but in comics its left-handed.  In the comics its right-hander.
Thr thor was directed by kenneth branagh, he is a great director and very funny, he made a great job directing the film
I think they both had good actors in it, Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorites, Thor was also by one of the good actors,
Anthony Hopkins was odin one of the best movies ever, too bad he died, I thiink he was in the Ragnarok film, I liked the first Ragnarok film, the second one was better, I also think Anthony Hopkins was Odin in the first one, the third one was the best, he was really good in both movies.
Sony rejected a $50 million offer for Marvels cinematic rights in 1997.  Now they have a $2.5 million offer.  Good chat!
I bet they are regretting that decision now!
Hi. Did you see the movie Thor? Tom Hiddleston was really good in the role of Thor.
I read the Information about that, I think it is interesting that he did, I liked the movie, but I did not know that, what did you think about it, I haven't seen the movie yet.
I can't imagine that it would work well on TV though, so I guess I won't see it.  I did like Thor: The Last Thor.  Have you ever seen that movie?
I have seen the movie.  I can't imagine him as Thor, but I can see Loki.  Do you like the movie?
I agree. He makes a really good Loki. I wonder if that is because some of the dialogue was improvised?
Yes, I've read the facts that there were real actors that were involved.  It was like a gauntlet.  I think that the real actors would have been too much of a mess if they had to mess around.  Did you know there is only one left handed actor in the movie?  I didn't know that.  Do you know if there is a left handed QB that is involved?
I don't remember if that is right? What is it?
It is the movie.  Thanos wore the "golden glove" which is a gauntlet on his hand.  Marvel has a "gold" glove and a "gauntlet" on his right hand.
I like marvel better. Iron Man is great! I like the avengers movies, but I like all of them. I think Iron Man was the best.
My all time favorite is Thor.  I love all the big Marvel movies and stories.  Disney cannot show too many Marvel Characters at their parks but the pretty much all the Marvel characters they have at Disney cannot Show at their own parks.  Thor is probably my all timeFavorite!
I think they have an odd contract to sign!  They can only show them east of the Mississippi, so they can't show them East of the US.  I would think that would be a very odd contract for them to sign, wouldn't you?
It does seems weird, I'm surprised but I guess they get paid so much money to be allowed to do that so I'm not surprised. I also think it's very surprising the fact that there are so many big Marvel characters in the cinema but they are only allowed to show one. I guess Spider Man is a bigMarvel character and they rejected an offer to do a new movie with him in the fact they would only get paid $15,000. Wonder how much money that actually was.
True, I wonder if it was because they didn't want to get access to the character? I bet they are kicking themselves now when they heard that, I bet no one will ever see the character again, and I wonder why they didn's get access.
I've heard of Access before and Marvel made a really kicking decision, it seems like a lot of money, but they must have lost a lot! I did learn that there was a neat superhero superhero boy that had to wear hearing aids, I think Marvel made him wear those, they are really cool, I wonder why they had to make him do that?
 Marvel has a hand in everything.  I would argue that X-Men are on the other hand, I would have to argue that x-men are the best, but I have respect for Stan Lee and the way he saw them as human.  Respect for Stan lee.
I guess because they have so many mutant genes and because of that they found a loophole to avoid paying the higher rates for the human ones, so they found the loophole to Avoid paying the Higher rates
I never knew that was a loophole for fictional characters.
haha ya I guess people were just avoiding to pay more money, I think it's cool that avengers of the war was shot entirely using imax cameras. It's creative, and I guess they are not using digital like some others, they're avoiding topay more money to use creative ways, I mean it's not like Avengers: Infinity War was shot using only digital cameras haha
That is really cool, I didn't know it was shot that way.
True, but it makes me wonder if future Marvel movies will have to be shot using those digital imax cameras like they do now, that makes it seem like it would be possible for all future Marvel Movies to be done that way.
I am not sure.  It is possible though.
Do you like to read comics?
I have read a few. I am a Marvel fan, I think I was a Marvel Fan, but I don't think any of the big like Spiderman were ever big enough to be big like spiderman 3. It's amazing how release times of movies can affect how much they are available online or on TV.
Spiderman was very popular but it cost Sony $15 mill when they did it. It was only $130 mill.
I wonder how that company is doing. A 15 year old boy, who was hearing aids, created a superhero to help make it more comfortable for a hearing impaired 13 year old to make them.
That is a great thing to do. I love it.
I do too. Michael Jackson wanted to play spiderman, but he did not have the powers of a hero. He only had one blue ear.
I don't know. Michael was into a lot of things.
That's a truth!  But he did produce and star in Spiderman.  If he could buy Marvel, he'd add "super-hero" to his name.  Did you know Marvel is smart for trademarking the names super-hero and super-villain to help them add to the names they already have?  Wonder what else will happen?  Maybe they'll buy DC and have them produce and Star in Spider-Man.
lol  Those are some unusual moves.
Yes and the ability to moon walk.
I would lean way back or forward... LOL... I can lean way way back.
It's crazy to think that they make movies like Thor that don't really make movies! Good thing they avoided using the avengers or the black panther, good thing they avoid the other movies like thor or the avenger!
I just watched the movie and he drew a portrait of Thor before the movie, and then watched theMovie.
I have seen it as well, its a great movie, its about war, the war of the sexes
No, I haven't seen it yet. Do you watch comedy or romantic movies?
It was fantastic, the way it came to an end left you guessing. I think that the War owes part of its success to Black Panther, and many people think that its end left You guessing, too.
I will have to make a point of watching it.
Apparently there is a correlation between the release of the success of Marvel movies and the success in the success the release, apparently there is, but it's interesting that they spaced out their release.
Interesting, well it's been great chatting with you, I hope you have a great day!
I tend to think you were successful.  Thanks, it was a pleasure chatting with you as well, I tend to be on my own this fine day.  You are also successful.
True, build on what you build!
Did you know there is a sequel to the avengers of the war?
I have, it is good and the first one in a new series, what about you?
Yea, it's pretty good and it was shot entirely on film, and with digital imax camera instead of film, so it's shot entirely with a digital camera
I guess the quality must have been high. It is not as good on bluray.
Yea that is pretty cool, I like Lou Ferrigno, he did the voice of Hulk and he's pretty cool
Lou is a great one. I know that he did some work on the Hulk before. It is awesome that he is the Hulk now.
Yea, Lou was the voice of Hulk in all the marvel movies and he was the only one that was the first voice to do so!
Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel in the early 90's and tried to play Spider-Man.  That worked out because he was able to play him in a produced movie that he produced.  But it didn't buy Marvel the rights to buy Spider-man.  I don't think he could do the voice well.
That's crazy, I know he wanted Spiderman but he didn't have Sony to help sell it. Interestingly Marvel didn't even want to sell it to him. They only wanted Spider-Man to be cinematic and not Sony.
I wonder how much they blew it? they have a catalog worth $2B but the execs never understand story. Hollywood needs stories, and they need to understand story!
I think in the billions, avengers and guardians of the galaxy, galaxy of the avengers, and others.
The Marvel characters seems confusing to me because there are a lot of different Marvel characters, but the Disney one is so big, it has its own show and has characters in theme parks east of the Mississippi. There are a few theme parks in Mississippi, but not a lot.
Yea, I wonder how big Marvel characters are in the attractions at Universal, do you think they have any of the big Marvel Characters in the new attractions?
I guess that's why kids like that.  Marvel has the appeal of the Blue Ear, created by a boy who needed hearing aids.  His mom told him that superhero's need hearing aids and he was uncomfortable with them and he told her he would wear his own.  The kid was nuts.  I guess he became a superhero.  He created his own superhero name - Blue Ear - because he needed a name for his 5 year old son who was uncomfortable in his own skin.  Wonder what Marvel came up with.
That was pretty cool. Marvel also has a superheoro named Access that is shared with the DC DC superheroo.
I wonder who they fight against?
He is the access sole job of keeping the DC and Marvel universes separate.
I guess that's a tough job. I don't know how that would work. I wonder if superheroes have to barge in and out of this universe under contract or if there is a contract with the superheroes.
I guess they are considered people by the courts.  The x-men are the same way.
I think the word "men" is insulting to the human being, but not to men.
I wonder what they considered mutants allowing Marvel to pay $15 for X-Men toys, legally. I wonder what it considered mutants  allowing Marvel
Are you a thor fan?
I am! I am a big fan of the marvel films!  How about you?
I prefer Thor. What about you?
I thought Thor Ragnarok was the best part of the Thor films, especially the improvised dialogue.
Yeah, I think that surely made the last one much more realistic in nature, and yeah, I did like it.
Tom Hiddleston originally was going to be part of Thor, he had to have a strict diet and gain about 20 pounds of muscle for the part, he did not want to go on a strict food diet andgain too much
wow, that sucks, I wonder if he was going to be just a side kick or something?
Ahhh...that makes you think... I wonder if he was a good Loki though?  He's one of Marvel's most memorable villains.
Yeah, I think he is depressed because of the change in character, I wonder why he would change in that way?
Oh, that's pretty funny, I remember that mid credits scene.  He was in the Shawarma restaurant in the avengers.  It caused a noticeable increase in sales at the shawarma restaurant, which is pretty funny.
Yeah, I have seen that!  That was a free advertisement for a restaurant!  The restaurant was glad for the free advertisement!
I haven't heard of Shawarma before, but I did see a movie about it.  It was with Tony, though..I never got a chance to see the movie.
Yeah it is a small restaurant, it is ok.
I bet Sony is kicking themselves for not getting the chance to use Marvel characters way back then. They bought the rights to the Marvel characters in the 70's, long before superhero films became such a big business. I bet Sony has already bought up all the rights and is using them now, since they were big business in the 80s and 90s.
Yeah, and yeah, comic characters will probably eventually be big in the future.  They just don't realize it yet.
Marvel once created a superhero that did not wear a hear aid.  I wonder why.  Wonder why the boy did not want to wear a hearing aid.
That was awesome, and now the boy wears them still.
Yeah I'm sure he does, he is only 4 years old so it's probably about the same time, they called him blue ear when he was a boy, that is why they called it that.
Cool. Did you know that?
I thought it was kind of weird little factoid.. Did you know the guy who voices Jarvis in the Iron Man films is the same guy who voiced him in the first Iron Man?  I thought that was kindof weird.
Yeah that is weird, I wonder why?  Yeah it was great chatting with you, I hope you have a great day!  Take care, and take care.
Are you a fan of the Avengers?
Yes I am!  It is a great movie franchise!
I like the series by Ironman but I like the new series by ironman 2 better. Robert Downey Jr. turned down $80M for a new one.
No need to fret about Downey, they will substitute actors for the characters anytime.
I wonder if he will be killed.
No matter how much I like them, I don't think they'll do prequels or anything like that.  I guess I would want sequels that bring the character back to life.
They could always get rid of some of the bigger name characters like Hulk.
I think that it would be safe to say that he is the lead in the big box office, and he is a big box Office.
I agree.  Thor is a hulk, not a Thor.
Spider-man is also in the movie series for Sony, but lives on in his own movie series.
Yeah, I think they mix the two together.  Thor being vulnerable is the best.
I think the actors will use their own personalities like Jimmy Kimmel to build the suspense and to leave us guessing.  Funny how he used personalities like Jimmy Kimmel to built the suspense of the tour to keep it funny.
I know.  Jimmy does a good job with that.  He will answer every single question you ask because the fans are dying to know the answer.
I know, right? Did you know that coincidentally, Disney owns both the marvel franchise and ABC Jimmy Kimmel show, coincidentally both are owned by the ABC Jimmy Jimmy Kimmel Show.
Jimmy is probably unwilling to reveal that. Makes me wonder why fans want the answer but he is unwilling to tell the fans.
It seems like he wants to leave us guessing. It was filmed in an Imax theater with the Imax cameras and the ImAX cameras were in the film to make an impact on the impression he was trying to give with the film. I think that is how he wants the film's to leave an impact.
I wonder if there are any Imax theaters in the area.  I know the closest one is 2 hours away in the DC area.
I know, Universal has one here in the east of the Mississippi river, but it works only if you go to Disneyland, which is on Disneyland, not Universal.  Disney cannot show many Marvel characters at Disney World, which seems strange, since Marvel characters are from the east and not the west.
That is odd.  You can show your product to half a country, but only half of the country?  Why not show your Product to half of them?
I know. A lot of the marvel characters are everywhere, like the Hulk ride at Universal Orlando.
I think I'm headed there soon! I think there is a theater there too.
Good morning! How are you? Did you watch Avengers: Infinity War? It was intense and more thanos of it, did you like it?
Good morning!  Yes I did.  I didn't like the first film, but it was shot in all digital imax cameras so it's the first one to use it in film!
Yes, it was a great picture! Very clear with great picture. Josh Brolin who played Thanos was an excellent villain and really explains why it was such a great film. He was the real bad guy, which is why it is so good. I think Josh Broin who played the bad guy was an Excellent Villanell.
Yes, he was.  The voice actor who played Jarvis in the Iron Man series was also the voice actor for the Avengers in the first 3 films. that's interesting.
I'm curious as a Marvel fan.  I know that the movie caused an increase in shawarma sales because of it.  Wonder why?  I wonder if the movie cause an increase?
LOL  The waitress Capt. America saves in the Avengers voiced Gretchen in Recess.  I'm sure Shawarma is everywhere.
Gretchen from recess is the one that did the Shawarma, Shawarma is a mediterranean cuisine usually chicken.
I have heard that name before, but I don't know who Gretchen is.  lol  I also heard there is a superhero called Blue Ear that Marvel Comics created.  It is a super hero called Blue ear that Marvel comics created.
yeah, I do know Blue ear, I think it's a superhero that was created by a 10 year old boy who was wearing hearing aids. It's really heartwarming.
Nice!  There is a character named Access whose sole purpose is to be named Access.  It is a Marvel / DC character owned by both companies and is the only character in both companies' universes separate.  I think Marvel wants to keep the two companies' universe separate.
I didn't know that. Batman and Hulk are both really big Marvel characters, but I thought Disney owned all of the DC characters. Wonder if they ever meet someday? It would be important to keep their worlds separate.
I know right, they do have theme parks east of the Mississippi, I've been there. They own all of their theme parks East of the US.
Yes, it is.  Due to the success it has done, they are going to revisit the contract Marvel signed with Universal Studios.
At this point, Marvel successfully argues in court that mutants are not human.  If they are mutants, they should pay a lower taxes rate on X-Men toys.  The tax man argues that people should pay higher taxes for dolls of a human. I think the higher rate is talking about the tax rate on toys, not taxes.
Smart idea! Sony could have saved a lot of money when they offered the Marvel cinematic rights for $50 million, but they only did it for $25 million. That would have saved them a lot.
Sony messed up there big time!
Agreed! I thought people would like it better if they bough spiderman. I didn't watch it but they got $65 million just for me to watch it. I thought it was going to be better.
Thats crazy.  Did you know that Thor made his Marvel debut before Spider Man, Hulk, Iron Man, and Hulk?  I assume that he also made his marvel debut before Ant Man.  I would have thought that Iron Man was a Thor fan.  He is, after all, a fan of Ant Man and the Ant Man
Yep I love the name, Thor is the beast, Chris Hemsworth portrays the god so perfectly
I agree!  It has been fun chatting with you this morning!  Thanks for all the years of these years!
I can't wait to see what the future holds for Thor and his brother Loki!  It's been lovely chatting with you as well!  Have a good day!
Hey! Justin Bieber has been around a long time! He's been around since his marriage to Hailey Baldwin in 2012!
I do not think it will last as long as Kim Kardashian and Chris Humphries marriage.
lol  I wonder if she posted a "love note" on Instagram to him.  It would be interesting to see if it was heartfelt or if she just posted it on Instagram.
It is.  I think he might give a year or two before he will try again.  What are your thoughts?
Yeah, me too, I give a year, I could do that forever lol, it's weird that in 2001 Justin Bieber granted 400 wishes for the Make a Wish foundation, weird but it was really nice of him, I wonder how many wishes he has given out, I know Justin Bieber's granted like 200 wishes so far,
Yeah, celebrities can be terrible wrap up, they can get a lot of maw like stuff, but some really nice people are there, too. And yeah, I like that too. I like nice people too, especially celebrities.
Yep I agree with you, I am curious as to how many of them. I know that there is a recording artist who is so shocking that he has never done any appearances before. I would have never have guessed that, but it is shocking!
yeah I would not have either!  I read somewhere that Baby is the most disliked video on YouTube.  I never knew that.  Who knew that could change anyone's mind?  I wonder if it was the most liked or the most dislike video.
I think it would change a lot of people's minds, apparently that video has like/dis dislikes of over 100 dislikes, and knowing that his foundation visits those who have dislikes. That would change many people's mind!
I do like him but I don't actively seek out his songs.  What is your favorite artist or band?
I like Ariana Grande.  She's really popular.  I thought she was Italian, but actually she is hispanic.  Did you know that Ariana's name is actually Italian?
Wow, I had no idea she was Italian! I always thought she was Hispanic, I thought she always was.
Yep I agree. Funny, she has a song about female empowerment called Dangerous Women. Talk about a hypocrite, it was written when she was a hypocrITE.
I recently see pics of a pathers game where a zamboni got hit with a puck at a paters game by a puck
That's funny! Apparently that happen sometimes to kids who care! She's very talented and she's only 25 years old. She co-founded a singing group called "Kids Who Care" and she is so talented.
I had no idea! She was the victorious and Sam and Cat.
Do you remember the manchester bombing?  She once raised $6,000,000 at a charity concert for the victims.
No, I did not know that. Was she performing? Did the bomb go off while she was performing?
Yeah, yep that was the one. It was interesting and also very scary in my opinion. She was very young when she was born so that's why it's so scary in the opinion, she was quite young.
Agreed, I had no idea about that. I feel the same way, do you watch music awards shows? I have no idea who the best performers are anymore, do yo?
Yep I agree with you. Do you like animals? I love dogs, I love Dogs.
Do you know much about Justin Bieber getting engaged to Hiley Baldwin?
I dont follow him at all, I dont really know him, I am not a fan either, how about you?
Me neither, I don't care for any of his songs and he chose not to marries this girl lol, I thought it interesting he didn't, I didn't care that much for some of his other songs either.
I dont know much about him, I dont really like him to be honest.
lol, well, I guess they have had so many romances, but finally he announced that they were engaged and they have been engaged since 2012 lol
No doubt, Hollywood relationships are like that.  I think Stephen Baldwin's daughter is also in it.
Yep Stephen Baldwin is pretty crazy that she is one of Baldwin's daughters haha. I was wondering if she was Canadian as well, Justin Bieber was born in 1986 and is Canadian, I was also wondering if Justin Bieber is one or not, I wonder if he is Canadian too
Wow thats making me feel old, I never knew he was Canadian, I wonder if he was always Canadian?
Haha yep, and that is amazing he was the only artist to have a songs debut in the top 10 of the top 100 in 2014.
He also granted 100 wishes for Make A Wish! Wow, mad props to him! He was also a successful teeny bopper phase, he granted over 200 wishes during that phase, mad prop.
Yeah he has done a lot as a recording artist and a recording as well.
I think it's important for the artists to give back, it seems to be a big deal. It's like cancer survivor things like make it so kids can have a big thing like that and cancer survivor's things like that.
Yep it is interesting that the song Baby is the most disliked on Youtube. I think there is worse songs out there, but that seems excessive, I wonder if it is just because it is so well known or if there is a worse song out there.
Yeah, it does.  I can't believe it.
Speaking of artists who have gotten hurt, do you like Ariana Grande? Apparently, she was hit in the head with a puck when she was 15 years old and got hurt, she's apparently only 15 years olds.
That would hurt, things fly fast and she was only 5!
Yep I'm shocked that he did not cause any significant damage.  He was Hispanic so it's not like he's Italian.
No I didnt know that I find it funny her song " female empowerment was written by 2pac, I didnt like that one, I find that very funny
lol  That is funny!  Her concert tour that she did after the Manchester bombing was really nice.  It raised 6 million dollars for the victims of the bombing.  She raised it all on a concert tour.
That is great! Artists really do give back to each other. I love that she is one of the artists that has such a huge pull.
Yep I agree with you. I wonder what kind of animals are there? There are twenty quintillion on Earth and I wonder if there are any of the twenty quint Billion on earth.
Hi, how are you? Do you like Justin Bieber?
I am a big fan of his music, do you like his music?
I am, his a song I listen to when I seek out a new song, he is not my favorite artist though.
I do love Linkin Park, how about you?
I do too, they were huge back in the day.
Yes they were! The movie Dredd was based on Justin Bieber's song "come together" which was the slo-mo theme for the movie.
I have yet to see that movie, is it any good?
Yes it is. Did you know that Bieber granted over 300 wishes to the Make-a-Wish Foundation?
Wow! That is really nice of him.
I was thinking the same thing. I know there is this guy who was banned for sharing the same name with the famous Justin Bieber. I was thinking he should be named Justin Bieber, since the guy was banned.
Yes he has had a number one hit in the UK.  Great Britain!
Interesting. Did you know his baby video is the most disliked video on youtube?
I feel like it says a lot for youtube! I like Ariana Grande, her song is the best!
Yes I do. She has a lot of television roles, what about you?
Did you know recently she was a fan hit for the Panthers puck?  I had no idea they had a fan's hit!
I bet that hurt! She was in the song Dangerous Woman, written by 3 men.
I find those tidbits funny like the concert that grossed more than $1bn after the Manchester bombing and the victims of the concert.
Wow, that is a lot of money! Do you like animals at all?
I do like animals. Do you like animals?
I love animals!  Did you know there are 20 quintillion animals on earth?
That is a lot of animals! I think I have to get going, nice chatting with you.
Hi, how are you?
Good.  Just wishing it would stop snowing.  I am wishing for the spring and going golfing soon.  It will stop snowING!
I'm in Chicago and feel you!  We got the snow blowed and salted here.
Chicago area is really neat with all the golf courses,  they take up a lot of land space and require a lot Of water,  golf courses in the chicago area take up lot ofLand space and requires a lot  of water
I work in parks and rec, so I have first hand knowledge of golf. I'm terrible, but I work in Park and Rec. It's home to cold beer and a day at the golf course. I have no second hand knowledge.
It's funny how recreation is like work to you, that literally made me laugh aloud. It's funny, you've literally made I laugh aloud too, personally I'd rather run than play either sport. I do like to play tennis but I don't play it for the work so I don;t play either game.
My parents would have absolutely waxed my back for joining a tennis tournament growing up. It would have been like joining a football tournament. I would have gotten absolutely waxED. It didn't make me feel right and would make me Feel old. I'd just bring them ice cream.
Ice cream and a tennis skill?  That is humbling, and it takes tennis skill to get ice cream!  I have Roger Federer tendencies, but he did not play tennis until he was discovered as a child.
Pretty sure Federer has a better serve!  I'm pretty sure Federre was able to hit a tennis ball into the head of a tennisball once in about five minutes, and it hit him in the head on his serve.
Yeah, he was certainly gifted.  I think he's kind of talented, but not gifted. The fact that he's won 22 Grand Slam titles attest to that.  He's been very impressive in that career, winning so many tournaments that there are only two tournaments without a trophy.  The fact he hasn't won a trophy in his whole career is impressive.
Cows?  How the hell he's gonna get two cows?  Is that a farm?  What the hell is he gonna do with them?
Can you imagine having your face plastered on an official stamp, like in Switzerland, where you get your face on anOfficial Stamp, and then get honored by having your name and face plazoned on it? That would be horrible.  I think they should make them pets!
Roger is good enough for a stamp, and a nice one too. I would not want my face on a stamp. I like cows, too. They are so nice!
I think tennis players are just too talented to be bad at it. Rafael nadal, novak djokovic and other tennis players, are pretty fit and attractive.  Too talented.
I watch nadal on tv. He has popeye in his forearms.
Interesting, I will have to check that out. I think he has won so many men's grand slams, he has had some successful careers and longevity, he's won more grand slams that all but one of the other men, pretty amazing stat.
Yeah.  I wonder where Roger and Raf competed though. Roger used to use a court that was half grass and half clay.  Rafael competed on a court thats half grass/ clay.
Can you imagine that? I wonder who won on that challenge? That would be a pose I wouldn't want to pose.
I wonder if the fans were really paid to go.  I know it's a corporate event.  The grass isn't the best for fans.  Raf was a clay and Rog is a grass.  But it was still paid for.
Good point!  I guess they both get prestige in their own end, but I guess the titles mean nothing if they don't get any more.  I wonder if the cows in the ATP rankings get more than the cows at the ATP Rankings, or if it's all for prestige.
Hahaha cows. that is a nice reference. nice reference! It was nice chatting with you!
Hi, how are you? Do you read movie reviews in rotten tomatoes?
Yes I do. I know Micahel Bay has a 93% rating on it, what about you?
Wow, movies make millions but some movies based on video games have ratings lower than that. I wonder if movies based in video games has ratings lower.
Yeah I guess they aren't that great. I wonder why Netflix has the ratings that way? I think his movies are really great, and I know Netflix doesn't have many ratings.
Wow, that is pretty impressive.
I learned that Warner Bros owns them but not surprised.
Yeah pretty cool. Spykids had a very high rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.
Yeah it was Lincoln, that is strange.  It was better than The Dark Knight rises and the dark knight rises of the dark.
Yes it is.  I like Black Panther too.  It's wicked.
I totally loved it. Black Panther is the richest superhero worth $500 billion.
Wow that is so much! He is richer than Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne! They are definitely worth a lot more than him. He is even richer than tony stark!
Yeah that is true. Do you watch the academy awards?
Yes I did, I think Daniel day Lewis has won 3 for best actor. This year was the first year since 1981 that he has won.
He is a talented actor, that makes sense. He was nominated for the Blazing Saddles, he is a really talented actor.
Nice. Walt Disney though holds the record for most of them with 22!
Wow that raises the bar high! I think Eminem has won oscars more than Leo Di Caprio, but I'm not sure.
Yeah, pretty cool.  He has surpassed both of those and Johnny Depp and George Lucas.
Yeah, and his talent is so many, the oscar were nominated for 9 emmys, he works so well for the talent.
Yeah, I am confused about that, I think the Oscars have been around since 1929. Do you know how old the Oscars are?
Yes there are 30 awards and they have a range of categories, so 30 awards in a range
Yes. Nice chat!  Thanks!
Hello! How are you?
Hi, I am well, how are you?
I'm doing well. What stood out in the article?
I like the rankings on Rotten Tomatoes.  It's such a reliable source of news.
I can see students using Wikipedia as a knowledge source for that too.
I know some students do it all the time, I had it in a grad school class once. I figure it would be better than the students using it for their grad school course.
Funny, I teach undergrad and made a point of using it when I was in grad school.  I also used wiki as my source of news when I had to teach undergrad.
I know kids do it now and they don't even use it anymore but I always pick it as a result and hope that the kids don't use it.
I think students need to be good enough to shine. they can't wait for the career. the career will be there for them.
What do you teach? How do you do it?
I teach sport management. How about you?
I was a teacher, but I had a job as a manager for refrigeration repair service company.  Before that I was a manager at a refrigeration Repair Service Company.  I went to towson university for undergrad and got a bachelor in sports management.  Did you know that there is a bachelor's in sports administration at towson University?
I am ready to start at the bottom.
Yea I figured that would be the mindset.  It is true that I am overstating it a little.  Not financially, I think.  I am not perfect and I am picky about my mindset. I think that it would be fine to start at the bottom and work on the data side of it.  Data analysis, data analysis is a difficult unpaid, unpaid, difficult masters degree in sports so it is fine.  financially, not perfect but I am trying my best.
I've thought about working for the statisticians in today's sports, I think it's just stats but there's so many stats out there I wonder if they really need statisticians
I have not looked into that, but I have looked into 1 avenue specifically. I will check it out.
Yeah, the numbers are just going up, with some teams even starting to use it for analytics department. Billy Bean started a revolution and he's not slowing down.
I'm an Orioles fan and it's astonishing the route that they took with analytics prior to the offseason. Shows how far it's come and how quickly it blew up.
Haha, poor buck! The old school mentality no longer works! I think they're going to go with a new school mentality soon!
He pulled a rabbit out of his hat to make the team competitive and then he pulled a second hat toMake the team compete again.  He was destined to blow up sooner or later.  I think it was just that he wasn't the right guy at the right time.
Good luck with that and with your job search!
Hi, how are you doing this evening?
Do you like to watch or play tennis or golf?
I like golf better but I'm slow and tennis is a different sport. I don't understand why I don's golf is the best sport, but I understand it.
I agree about golf, but Tennis is more interesting. I used to play tennis. I think it's easier to learning with singles or doubles, but not sure. Golf is much easier to Learning with singles.
I figure with singles you would learn more, but with doubles you would make mistakes faster. I did it when I was a kid. Equipment, courts, and everything is more expensive so you would have to learn as a kid, but I figure with the equipment you could learn.
Growing up in DC, we didn't have a lot of courts because we didn' live in an area that had a lot.  Now days, they've spread out a lot more courts.  I can't imagine playing a match for 3 hours when the area where I live is only spread out over 3 or 4 days.
I can't believe it took 11 hours, I guess I just wanted that bonus, I wouldn't watch the entire thing, I would watch the whole thing, but I guess they must have wanted that Bonus
I'm not sure. Did you know the referee was not a referee? I didn't think so. Did yo know that Polo shirts were first created for tennis players and they only wore polo shirts?
Those shirts seem comfortable but a bit too stylish for me. I guess it's important for the athletes, but they can seem stylin' while bashing a ball.
I know, right? I guess polo shirt is more catchy than tennis shirt, but sports like tennis and polo are about practicality and I guess Polo shirt is a better name for sports like Tennis, more for the practicality,
I think they skew more toward the high end of the tennis world.  lol  The US open used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts.  I wonder if that was a solution to the skew in the tennisworld or if they used the helicopter to Dry the grass for the US Open.
I think that is a genius solution, I wonder if grass on the courts would have been better.  Did you know that in the US Open the year a black man won the title, only one black man has won the US open the year.
I think the sport favors the rich. Too much equipment, courts, coaching, coaching. Too few black kids have access to the level of equipment. The Williams sisters were an exception to that.
I think the sisters have had better chances, but they also have some good looks. They have natural talent. Have you heard of Gael Monfils?
I have heard of Gael Monfils and his dad pushed him to get athletic, he must have been really athletic.
Roger Federer of paddle tennis, the Roger Federer  of paddle Tennis.  Just days after learning how to play he became a quarterfinalist at the US Open in 2010 and beat a man who beat him by three days.  Natural talent and a natural talent.
That's the kind of talent that some people just don't get thinking about! Roger Federer gifted two cows during his career for winning the 2002 Swiss Open and the Wimbledon in 2006. I wonder if the cows were the same one that Roger FedRoger gifted two cow during his whole career for Winning the US Open.
That's a lot of steaks and burgers. Good meat, but expensive. Probably for his protein intake.
I wonder who sells the milk in that special Federer line?
The swiss also honored him with an official stamp and he was the first person to have one.
That is a great honor, I think. Well, I enjoyed chatting with you!
Hi there, do you like movies?
Yes, I do.  There are some good ones aligned to come out this weekend.  I think there are some really good ones aligning this weekend too. How about you?
I do too. I saw that Warner brothers owns Rotton tomatoes list.
I didnt know that, I wonder if they are biased towards certain movies, or just the movies.
I'm not sure, it's interesting that a video game film has rated R. I wonder why?
I guess video games are fine with a rating on Rotten Tomatoes, I think Netflix has a great selecion of movies, too.
That's a lot of movies, I guess. I've seen some of them, the dark knight rises was one of them. Have you seen it?
I used to love that movie,  that is a good rating!
I guess it did, but I don't know if it was better than Michael Bays rating of 93% on the Rotton tomatoes. Too bad movies like that are always bad.
I did watch Black Panther. It has an unfari rating of 100%
I did, Chadwick Boseman was good in it. It was a good movie.
He is a great actor, he really sold the part and I think he did a good job. The director did a very good job with the film as well, he is a really great director.
He does have a great net worth though. Black Panther has a great Net worth of $8.5 billion.
Good on financials lol he is the richest hero in the country, he is definitely the richest superhero, he must be really good on financiali
I think so, no superhero comes close.
Bruce Wayne is still insanely rich, his net worth is $8.62 billion. Thats like Bruce Wayne with a net worth of $100 billion.
True.  I do not watch award shows but I do like to watch them sometimes.  Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor.  He is the only actor to win an Oscar 3 times and he's the first actor to do so.
I didnt know that, he must be a very talented actor, I wonder which categories he was in, the Oscars have 24 categories, I know there are 24 oscars
Yes that is crazy!  I can't believe that Walt Disney has won so many.  I wonder how many he has won.
It is, that is crazy and also suprising, Walt Disney changed our culture forever, he deserves an award ot twenty, he has changed ourculture forever that is why its so suprising and he deserves a award, Walt Disney changed our society for the better,
He was great, he is so great!
Are you a golf fan?  Apparently there is a golf course in dubia that requires 4,000,000 gallons of water a day just to green it up.  Such a waste of water!
Yes, it does seem like a waste.  The average American golf course consumes around 312,000 gallons of water per day.  I wonder how many gallons ofwater that is.
Wow.  I heard that in the US, golf course take up more land space than Rhode Island and Delaware combined.  Golf courses take up much more landspace than Rhode Islanders and Delaware Combined.
That is a pretty incredible amount!  Samuel Jackson puts a golf clause in his film contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production and has a golf course in his contract that allows for a course to be used twice a month for each film.  That clause is very useful.
Nice!  I would love to see that!  Babe Ruth was a famous baseball player as well, and I am assuming he was a very famous golfer in America as well.  I wonder if he had time to do that?  I know Babe Ruth is the most famous golFER in America and I'm assuming that he had the time to be nice.
I never would have guessed that either. I didn't know he was a big golf player.
He must be a huge fan of the polo crowd.  polo shirts were originally invented for tennis.  I wonder if he caught on with the polos crowd and that's why poloshirts were originally invention for tennis?
Interesting fact.  The US open had to use a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts and I bet that created a lot of wind.  They didn't have grass tennis Courts in 1969.
That's crazy. I remember watching that.  The longest match in history went on for 11 hours over 3 days and was over rubber legs.  I think it was about 11 years ago, but I remember that.
No doubt.  I wonder if at one point either player thought it was over.  There is big money on the line, but who knows what was worth it.  Maybe they both just wanted to get out of there.
Haha thats a good question. I think Roger Federer was gifted for winning Wimbledon, the Swiss Open, and playing for cows. I wonder why he was not gifted for Winning Wimbledon?
Lol, that is neat, he was the first living person in Switzerland to be honored with a stamp, he is the first and only living person to have a stamp.
He suffered the biggest injury in his career when he was drawing a bath for his daughters when he suffered it, and it was the biggest one of his career.
I think he tore his meniscus.
Yeah, I bet he is really pissed about that.
I bet he was.  Rafael nadal, federer, and novak djokovic have accounted for 78 percent of the singles mens grand slam titles this year.  I bet that would put a dent in the earnings of Rafael nalberto, federers, and federer.  They have accounted to 33 percent of all singles grand slam wins so far this year!
Wow, and Nadal and Federer once competed in a hybrid court that was half clay and half grass.  I wonder how that worked.  Half clay andHalf grass, half grass, it worked well.
I'm going to have to look that up on YouTube, interesting.  I wonder how Federer has been running since Oct. of 2010. He's continuously ranked in the top 3 since Oct., 2011 and as of Nov. of 2014 had a run of being at the top since then.
Yes, and he was on the top spot for 914 weeks, a record that has been held by only 2 other all time greats. He is the only one to have been in the rankings for 915 weeks. That's a record.
The guy is the Roger Federer of paddle tennis.  Did you know that a player named Gail Monfils beat the "Roger Federer" of paddle Tennis and was only 18 days earlier, and play against the guy named Roger Federers a few days earlier?  I wonder what the name of that guy's name was.
I have no idea but i wonder how she did it. It was great chatting with you!
I enjoyed chatting! Have a good day!
Hi, are you a golf fan?
I am, tiger woods is a great global golfer, he drew the first gold in the sport in 1805, he is a tiger woods, and a great Global golfer.
Yeah, he was dominant, but he was always a factor when it came to coming back into contention. He is still fighting back, but not as dominant.
I think he did make a comeback after a rough start after a big scandal.  I think he was a factor in the 2014 but had a rough started after that, I don't know if he will make it back.
In the recent tournament he started the final round but was out of contention.  In the past he was so dominant and in the past in the tournament he start the finalRound and was in contention.
Wow, I agree, I think he's not as good as past tournaments but he's getting off to a great start, he's fighting hard and I love tennis so he's doing well, he was in the state of the state in an interview and said he's just not as bad as he was at that time. He was saying he's putting in his best, but he just isn't as good at the time, I can't believe he scores as well as he does now, wow, he didn't seem as good in the interview as he used to, he said he was fighting hard but maybe not as strong as he is now.
I find it interesting that polo shirts were actually invented for tennis players.
I love how it was inspired from tennis players. I know tennis has some intense competition and with a hollow rubber ball, racket and a hollow hollow rubber balls it is great to watch them compete. Polo has great clothing and I am sure inspired from Tennis, it is also great to watching them compete, I love how Polo has the best looks.
I watch tennis occasionally, but I was not interested prior to 2016.  I am interested now, with Djokovic seemingly win all the time and then Federer, Nadal, and Djokowski seemingly win the most.
Roger Federer had a huge injury and he is not sure how he will recover and return to playing, he is a great player but not sure if he will be able to do it. He is number 1 in the world for ranking but he is still number 1, he must recover andreturn to playing.
He is the only living person in Switzerland to be honored with a stamp, he will be the first living person to have his name on a stamp!
Yes, that must be a proud moment for a nation to be recognized and supported by a beast, a beast that is a legend of a man won 22 grand slam titles in his country, that should be recognized as a proud Moment to be a legend and to be appreciated and recognized andsupported by your country.
I didn't realize he had that many singles victories in grand slam history. I didn't even realize he has that many victories in Grand Slam history.
I didn't know that either.  He was ranked one of the top starting QB in all sports.  I feel like he was playing professional before he was ranked #1 like Roger or Tiger was the top 3 top starting quarterbacks, I believe.
I thinkfederer is a great example, but tiger has drawn people to watch golf, so Tiger has drawn in more golf fans.
I agree!  Tiger Woods has even drawn men into joining country club, I looked it up and thought it was the only way I wold be able to play and enjoy the game.  I thought I would just play and play and Enjoy the game, but it looked like the game was for everyone!
I agree! I hope he doesn't get too far into the woods sorting it out again. If an athlete goes bad, they have to give up, especially if the swing of an athlete.
I think he has hope.  He realizes his mistakes and he wants to swing back.  The sport is not easy and I think he is only 40 years old but I don't think he will give up on the sport.  I think it is not too easy to get a swing back after all these years.
Yup, I agree. Well, it was pleasant chatting with you.
It's been a pleasure!  Who is your favorite professional golfer Tiger Woods?  I like his status and his favorite professional golfer Tiger Woods!
Take care!  Thanks.
You too!  Thank you!
Hi, did you know that five states have dinosaur fossil?
I did know that, that is surprising, I thought there were more.
Did you know that the Jurassic World fallen kingdom was in JUpiter's fallen kingdom?
Yeah, I did.  I loved the graphics effects but the movie was a little cheesy.  But I loved The Last Jurassic.
I did. I am happy they got a different lead actor from the originals
The originals are classic.  I also enjoy Chris Pratt.  It's funny that Pratt joked that he got the lead role so long ago.
Did you hear that the ride cost $75 million to do and the film cost $25 million, wow, that is so much, I wonder why.
I did not hear that, I wonder why? I would rather be waiting in lint than on the ride.
No, I have not. It's past my time. I stay in the "lane" lane. Did you hear about the rain soaked T-Rex? It took them 4 hours to render one frame of a rain soaked t-rex.
Yeah, I know, honestly that is an iconic scene, but I don't think it was worth it.
Did you know that raptors are not generated by computers but by real ppl inside.
that surprises me.  I know that the dinosaurs were mesotherms but I don't think that movies used them for effects.
I can't believe it.  I did not know that.  There are more than 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.
Really? I believe that is a real number, that is cool that is believed. The loch ness monster is a protected species, I think it is cool it is aprotected species.
yeah, back in 1912.  I wonder what the Scottish protections are.
Yes that makes it right.  Did you hear that domestication gives animal white forehead patches?
Yeah well Germany was the first country to give animals universally constitutionally-guaranteed rights in 2002.
Yes, very progressive. I wonder what blastula would think of that?
I do not. It sounds like an interesting word. What is it?
It is, they say biology classes were so fun in HS.
I know it is, insects are the only living animals species to have it. It was nice talking to you!
1 million species? that's almost one million species!  Nice to talk to you too!
You too! Thanks. Thanks!
Hi, do you like Batman?
I do like Batman, he is a tragic and mysterious superhero
I love him as well. Did you know Universal studios had plans to build a gotham city theme park in DC?
I think that is a bad idea.  People would be so expensive there.  And it would be expensive for the people there.
I bet its very expensive to build. It is, I will have to check it out I bet.
True! Batman fans would love the place. Smallville was originally planned to be a darker show about Bruce Wayne becoming Batman. I think Batman fans wouldn't love that! Smallville is much darker than it looks. Batman fans Would definitely love the Place!
Wow. Michael Keaton was going to reprise the role of Batman forever but he couldn't sway $75 million to let him do it. Maybe $75 Million is enough to sway him to do Batman Forever?
That is a lot of money for Michael Keaton, I guess he was not into it. It is a rewarding role though, $15 million is a bunch of money  for Michael keaton but it is a very rewarding role.
I bet!  Stan Lee wrote so many comics. I was unaware of that, and I didn't know that Stan Lee was in comics.
I guess he wanted to give us more superheroes.
I guess he did! Have you read any comic books?
I did read them when I was young, but I don't read much now.
I do, Stan lee ends every phone conversation with the word "excelsior!"
I guess he has his quirks. I wonder what that meant.
It stinks that he only recently passed, it really stinks!
He lived a long life, longer than I did. I bet Stan would have been 85. I think he lived a very long life. Michigan State University library is the largest and most publicly available library in the world.
He did live a very long life.  That is cool.  I am from Michigan and have been to Michigan.
Stan created over 300 registered superheroes in the US alone.
I bet he created them all!  Thats pretty cool.
I agree.  He did create a new superhero called "Normalman".  He was a person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes.  Why create a superhero for a planetfull of superheroes?
Good talking to you!  Have a good one!
Did you happen to watch Batman the animated series?
I did for a little bit.  I am not familiar with it at all, I read comic book series and I like Bruce Timm.  How about you?
I watch the show alot as a kid, I remember batmans glowing eyes.
Too funny. I think there was a competition between the comics and the competition
Yea, but that's just Marvel making better movies.
I never made the connection between Batman and the Suicide Squad movie, but I did not see it either, but it makes sense since I only made the Connection between Batman & the Suicide squad movie
No connection between the two Suicide Squad.
 Suicide Squad is about Harley Quinn, and Batman the animated series creator Bruce Timm produced Batman the Animated Series creator BruceTimm produced batman the animated Series.  I don't know how Harley Quinn is in it.
Yes, and that worked for her!  Did you ever see the Wolf of Wall Street?
Huh, that's amazing. I haven't seen a Batman movie with Michael Keaton back in the 70s though. I've seen Batman Forever, which was amazing.
He would probably take the money back if it weren't so terrible and get some money back for it.
Yeah, I never knew that.  I watched the first one and looked it up, I also looked up the movies and comics and I didn't know Smallville was originally going to be a show about Bruce Wayne becoming Batman.  That would have been pretty cool to see.  Yeah they have shows about him in the comics I think.  Did you know there was also a show in the 60s that was going to have a showabout Bruce Wayne's becoming Batman?  Who knew!
I never watched that one either, but I know that DC is known to offer lots of origin stories. I mean, the man of steel for Superman.
Excelsior!  Word on the word.  Creative genius types like Stan Lee of Marvel Comics are a bit eccentric.  He ends every phone conversation with the word "excelsiors"  He is a creative genius, but ends most phone conversations with "exceedsior."
Hah, that is so rip Mr. Lee.
Did you know the dc in dc comics stands for detective comics?  It sounds redundant, but it actually stands for Detective Comics.
I had no idea.  I wonder why?
The Michigan State University has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world.
That's a pretty large university so that's not real surprising but still, it's a little surprising. It's a big university.
I think it's interesting that the superhero call him "Normalman" has no super powers. I wonder what super powers they have?
I guess the eay answer is hes not really,
Hi. Do you like animals?
I do like animal. I like the m puppets. What about you?
I love animals! I know that individual animals are predicted to exist today and some animals are predicting to exist for much further!
I do not know. I heard that construction on a new ramp for a dried up lake might not stop there because they found more unknown biological creatures than the old ramp. I wonder how many. They say it was for a dry up lake.
Yeah I guess we are always exploring new species. There are about 20 quintillion of them out there.
That's a lot!  Speaking of which, did you know that the Jurassic Park dino's are slowly sinking in a lake of biological matter.  I always thought that they had to stop construction on the lake because of that but I don't remember seeing that.  The last scene I saw in Jurassic Park was the dino poo scene where they had a lot of people trying to stop it from slowly sinking into the lake.  It's not a lot, but I thought it was a lot.
I can't remember that. I know the dinosaurs only appeared for about 10 minutes.
My son and I both realized that when we saw the movie and then I learned that on the TV show Dino Poo and I guess Dino Poop were an important part of the show Dinosaur. He never realized that.
ohh interesting.  Do you know if the ride cost more than the movie?
No I didn't know that but I did realize that Jurassic World came out last year. What do you think about Fallen Kingdom? I haven't seen it yet, have you?
Yeah I know, I didn't like that movie either. Do you know how they generated the raptors?
I knew Jurassic World had some computers but I didn't know how they got the ostriches to do work! lol, they had to use ostriche!
I think they probably used people in suits.  It was cheaper.
I heard that, funny, computers are used more and more now.  Did you know that the T rex dinosaur in the movie took over 24 hours in each frame to render?  That movie took so many computers.
That is amazing. Chris Pratt joked that he had been the lead for about 10 years!
I heard about that, I wonder if it was a mistake or if he left out the dung smearing scene like in dinosaur movies.  That was probably his only mistake.
Yup, in the states, you can't own a dinosaur or fossil that is not a dinosaur.
I didn't know that. I remember in that movie, The Last Dinosaur, I had to learn that during the dinosaur poo scene. I wonder if there are bones in that one.
I guess we will see. Did you know that dinosaurs were mesothermic?
I did not know that.  I think I lived dinosaurs as a kid but I don't remember the period.   I remember learning dimetrodons as a little kid.  Not dinosaurs but lizards.
That's pretty cool. Did you know in Canada there is a dinosaur coin.
Hi, how are you?
Good, thanks.  Are you a Batman fan?  I think it's cool that the Universal had plans to build a Batman theme park a while back.
I am good, and yes I am a Batman fan. I would have liked to see the theme park. It would have been cool to see. What was the themePark about?
I've heard that.  My favorite Batman movie of all time is actually Smallville.  I guess it was originally going to be Gotham, I heard.  Mine the Dark Knight.  Did you know that was originally the name of Bruce Wayne becoming Batman?  I think it was because he was from Smallville, not Gotham.
The Dark Knight is probably my favorite batman.  I liked Christian Bale in it.  Did you know that he is the only one who has not been in every batman movie?
Yeah, Val Kilmer is my favorite. I think Michael Keaton is the best. I like him because he can be Batman forever and never have to reprise the role. He could be Batman and never need to get a huge payday like when Clooney had to convince him to reprises Batman for a huge paycheck in 2004.
Wow,  that is too much money for a movie!  I wonder why he didn't want to go.  Maybe he didn's like the comic books?  lol or didn't like the money.
I love comic books! someday I would like to checkout the comic book collection at Michigan State, it is the largest and most public in the world.
That is amazing, Stan Lee must be proud of them, or so proud of himself.
haha ya I know, the dc comics stands for detective comics comics, I wonder if that means anything to you?
That's funny, I would have thought it stood for something else! Finally, I finally know what it stands for! I wonder why Washington DC? It's really nice there!
excelsior! Stan lee was such a character. He'd end every phone conversation with "excel!
Great guy, I think. I wonder what he looked like. I know Stephen King did the whole thing, and did cameo shots for the movies.He was famous, but not for the way he looked.
Stan Lee was also an actor, back in the day he was a generic actor, but back in 1958, Marvel published a comic book with Stan Lee as the super hero and super villain, and Marvel films used him as the villain.
He is super smart. I have never heard of Normalman, is he super smart?
No, I have not. What is Normalman?
Apparently he is the only person on the planet without superpowers.  Kind of a odd name considering there are so many superheroes.
Haha, I had no idea! I think it would make a great comedy setup. I like the idea that the Marvel comic universe take place in a multiverse but is set on Earth. The Marvel comic universes are often set in a different multiverse than the DC ones. That would make for a great Comedy setup.
Interesting.  I wonder how much pollution on Earth contributed to that?  Maybe superheroes superpowers are going to go away in the near future because of all the pollution on earth.
No doubt. There is a comic series about fixing some of the damage created by super heroes and their adventures. I wonder if the pollution has anything to do with the comic series. It's about the damage and the damage Created by super hero's and the pollution in their adventures,
That is cool beans!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this morning, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.  Cool beans!
You as well! You as well.
Are you a Batman fan ?Universal studios had plans to build gotham city a new batman theme park.
I am not really into Batman. Never watched any of the movies but I have seen Michael Keaton in them. I loved him in Batman: The Last Man on Earth. I would have loved to have seen Gotham City at Universal Studios. Now, I wonder where they got the money for it.
GothamCity wouldve been amazing. universal wouldnt have done it. the show was planned out, had plans. Smallville was originally going to be the next batman, but bruce wayne and the universal would didnt go through with it. batman was going to show up. that wouldve was amazing.
I can understand how Russian would want to put Ninja Turtle with Batman lol but I can't understand how Bruce Wayne would like watching Smallville as a show.
Haha. I dont know, I dont think he was missing much in Smallville, I think they told him to be in it, and I think in the end he finally puts on the cape.  lol.   I like how the last 2 seasons of that are the only seasons where he is not in the cape, haha.
Wow, wow that is a lot of TV seasons, yeah it's a little funny that it was on for so long, reading about Stan Lee is interesting, the fact that he ends every phone call with word "excelsior" is interesting.
That is amazing, he would simulate a conversation just to simulate a convo, and then have Stan Lee end the convo with "Amazing!". I wonder how they did that? I wonder where did Stan Lee ended up with his company and when did he get the chance to end it? The DC in DC comics stands for Detective Comics, and DC comics stood for Detective Comic, so the name is redundant.
I think true DC fans travel around the world for comics.  The michigan state univesity has the largest comic books collection.  I wonder how many true dc fans travel to the largest comics collection in the world?
lol I think that would be at a comicon.  There are over 300 registered superheroes in the united states and there is only one comicon that does not have a registered superheroes.
I had no idea! I think it's comical that there is a superhero called Normal Man who is actually just a superhero.
haha that makes no sense, like how would you be a superhero without any super powers? I don't see how you could be a super powers.
Go back to Stan Lee, he had a great imagination. He created Batman and Superman, the two superheroes.
It was sad he passed away, he had an amazing life, very imaginative and I am sad he Passed away, but he sure did have an amazing Life.
His legacy will live forever.  Batman vs. Jack the Ripper is only 15 years old, and it's not stopping anytime soon.  The possibilities are endless.
Yeah, not to mention marvel has been around for a while too.
I have been wanting to watch Gotham lately, I enjoy all of the series or movies about superheroes, do you like them?
I love the movies. Marvel is always good, I really like the Flash series, and I am just catching up on the new Gotham cuz it's catching up with the old ones. I don't know if I like Gotham cus there's a lot of back story on it, but it's a good break from the old Flash series that had a lot more of a back story.
Did you ever watch the Batman and Robin series? I used to watch it as a kid but I never made it to the new ones that were made when it first came out as a little kid
I watched the cartoon series a lot.  I caught it a few times.  It was awesome though.  The real people in the cartoon are just awesome.
I never thought of that. I like anime tv shows as well. Did you know the largest comic book market is Japan?
It was great talking to you!  Have a good one!
Hi, are you a big shoe fan? I am. I collect different styles and like to collect different ones
I like shoe I like the mood. lol
lol  Did you know professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week?  lol
I heard about that I wonder how many pair it would take a week to wear through a pair, that is alot of dancing.
I bet!  lol just kidding!  If you have smelly shoes,  you can put dry tea bags in them lol Just kidding,  tea bags will absorb the bad odor.  Put dry tea in smelly Shoes.
I've had shoes I wear for spin class that have a foul odor that will get rid of that.  I'll have to try the teabag trick on the shoes I have.  That will help.
Nice!  lol  NFL wide receiver Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after each game to help with the shoes. lol
That's good he does that! I would be out of pairs of boots if I were him!
I do.  They were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm.  Uggs were their name.  I use them to keep my feet warm too.
Wow, I read that, I didn't know that. Apparently they used to make rubber boots. The Nokia company used to do that and apparently that was the name of the Nokia company
Wow that's a long time, I did not know that! I wonder if people still use those? I know that once people went to get boots cleaned in Paris for a longtime. A man stopped to get his boots cleaned and after a few minutes they bacame so bad that the cleaner stood outside to get them photographed. The man was photographed and then history will know for sure that man stopped and was photographed for 20 minutes, and the cleaner stand outside the door for 10 minutes they Bacame in!
That is so interesting that someone would want to be in a picture with someone just to get their picture. I bet that is what they were looking for.
I bet they didn't even know they were in the picture either! Do you follow the US congress at all?
I try to follow them as much as possible, but as of late they have become very divisive, do you follow it?
I do. The bickering really turns it around, did you know a woman was elected to Congress in 1916?
There was so much bickering and alot more cooperation at that time I didn't realize a woman was elected before she could even vote.
I believe she did vote in the last national election. It's kind of odd that Elmo is the only non-human to testify before Congress. He was the only other non- Human to testify during a national election!
That is odd. I read today that a fantasy congress exists. I heard it's a game, I wonder if it's any different from the game I just read today.
No, I haven't heard of that, what is it?
It is where apparently the players can draft congress members and they gather points based on their legislative actions and the success of their legislative action.
Interesting.  Anyway, I've got to run now.  It's been nice chatting with you.  I've had a great evening!
Do you like ballet?  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes in a week!
That's a lot of shoes and money. Do you know how to tie your shoes?
I figure that they should have more than that then. Did you know that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes? I wonder how well the 5000 yearOld shoes perform?
Yeah, I wonder if pointe ballet shoes do too.  Bill Nye, the guy that holds the patent, does pointe Ballet shoes.
Pretty crazy. Uggs were originally made for surfers, that's pretty crazy too
Nice!  shoes inspired by the wizard of oz.  I have one of those at home and just got the gps installed.
I'll have to check that out, lol.  There's an app for that for things people will buy.
I'm not sure, but they make them look comfy. The Queen of England has people that wear her shoes, I wonder who wears them.
That's funny! I heard about that, I wonder if she is wearing the Queens shoes right now. I wonder what shade of nailpolish she is using? I'd buy some at the drug store if I was wearing them. I don't even own a shoe.
Wow I guess that is peculiar.  Persians do not wear high heeled shoes.  Why would they wear highHeels shoes?
That's right and they started a trend that would go around the world! In 1908, a shoe cleaner was accidentally the first person to be photographed being a person, and he started a Trend!
Wow cool!  What is your favorite kind of shoe?  I like comfy boots especially in the winter,  I have comfy shoes but I also like boots for the winter.
I like sandals for the summer.  I am barefoot so the only thing I would ever use are sandals.
Nice!  Prince played bowling and wore knee high boots.
No, but that sounds like he got paid to endorse them.  Stephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed at $15.00 and was not paid to endors.
That is odd. The guy once stole coins from a wine by taking and placing them in boots.
Interesting. Did you know there are three subway lines exclusively for congressmen to move between the Capitol and senate offices?
Wow I guess they have to separate them. I wonder how often they use them. The congress and the president can declare someone an honorary citizen. The president can declarations one, and the congress can declare one an honorary Citizen too.
That is a pretty cool concept! I think it's wrong, but it happened recently when an immigrant climbed a wall to save a child.
It was in France, right?  People have won in other people have won as well.
That's pretty cool, I wonder how much they earn for it. Anyway, great chat!  I need to go.  I think I'll go earn myself one now.  Thanks!
It was great!  Thanks!
Elmo testified before congress?
I did not know that.  I wonder why Elmo would need to go?
Elmo is the character on Sesame Street
Interesting. He was actually able to testify before the U.S. Senate.
I guess it was a light hearted joke before real proceedings.
ya that's awesome, apparently they have fantasy congresses, I bet that is some real boring stuff, I'd like to see those fantasy congresss, they must be awesome,
It is? I wonder how you win money on that, or if you could win money at all?
No.  I don't know.  It would be interesting to try it though.  They used to play a republican vs democrat baseball game there.
I never knew that. I also didn't know Ugg boots were invented by surfers.
I did not know that!  I would have thought they were invented by skiers,  I agree they are really weird,  but I agree with the thought they are weird.
I agree, they are kind of silly, kind of goofy but I am a typical college girl.
A professional ballet dancer shoes go through 4 pairs of shoes a week.  I wonder how much longer it will take for a professional ballet dancers shoes to last, and how many pairs of boots they'll go through.
I wonder if that is the same for the reason?  I think it is weird that they have to have their feet do that?
I know!  Putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes will absorb the odor.
I'll have to try that tonight.
lol, I know!  I would try it out.  I wonder if Nokia still has the rights to make rubber boots?
I did not know that either. I wonder why they decided to switch over to phones?
I think it was more profitable for them.
That's a good thought!
Yeah.  Do you think it was pre or after WWI?
I dont think I saw one.
Hopefully it doesn't happen. Did you know that the phrase pulling oneself up by their bootstraps meant to do something impossible?
Cool info, I didn't know that.
do you like star wars?
I love them. Do you know how the whole franchise thing began?
Back in 2004.  How many years is that?
Yeah true. Oscar Isaac who plays Poe Dameron is really good
I do not know.  It was filmed in the scene for planet yavin 4 in Guatemala.  Did you know that?
Yes he was a native of that planet. I wonder if he requested that Poe was from that planet
Yeah. Lucas's wife won an Oscar for film editing.
Yes and insterted a lot of the awesome scenes like Lei good luck kiss and the like.
Yeah so pretty much. And she won so she deserved it, she won it really well
Yeah. 21st Century fox was convicned that the movie would flop.
Yes and Lucas got the rights to the movie for half a million dollars so he could keep the rights and then he did it himself, for Lucas to own the movie
Yes. How did he become a billionaire so quickly after that movie came out?
Yeah. Do you know the Disney company?
Yes I do. Do you know what Minnie Mouse's real name is?
Yes it is Minerva and she is the second Minnie.
I see. They made the movie The Flubber and they consulted Bill Nye when they made the film.
Cool, how nice the science guy. The movie wall-e is a tribute to him, and the movie wall -e is also a tribute
Yes it is a tribute to Walter Elias Disney
Yeah, and they hide things Mickey in disney things for people to find in our culture.
Nice it sounds like a fun hunt for Mickey items.
It is pretty cool. It really is. Nice chat!
Do you watch Star Wars?
Hey there, I do like Star Wars!  I like the old movies and the new movies.  How about you?
I have seen all the Star Wars series. I liked the first one the best. What about you?
My favorite one is probably George Lucas's "A new one" lol.  I think it's funny that Star Wars was thought to be going to flop when 20th Century Fox gave the rights to George Lucas to a new movie.  It was a flop!  I don't know why.  Maybe it was because they didn't like the movie?
I loved all the first 4. There was a lot of back story to the series and it was good. The last two released in 2016 were really good. I think the third one is coming out around Christmas every year.
Yep the backstory is interesting. I like the director James Cameron he is directing the new Star Wars. I heard he also directed the last Terminator in True Lies, I wonder who he is Directing the new one
Hes really good, he did great movies, awesome ones, he has done great movies.
I agree with you! I like the star wars movies as well. Colin McGregor's brother, Ewan who is in the British Air Force, was calming lol. He said that he thinks the kenobi was in the star Wars movies because he was in it with his brother.
hahaha Thats amazing, I didnt know that,  thats amazing
Yes I think you are right!  George Lucas, artoo-detoo, told the entire Star Wars saga, that he is told a hundred years in the future, in the near future, by George Lucas that he will have become the new George Lucas and will take over the entire star wars saga, and that he has already done all the movies LOL.
Yes I do know who that is!  He's not my favorite lol,  but I hear he's one of my favorite LOL,  it's cool that Lucas' wife at the time won academy award for editing,  she was the 1st one to do so.  I think she was also the first one to ever time won Academy award for Editing.
I agree, she was very talented, I think she is underrated and very talented. I'm glad that she had Star Wars appreciation, and I'm also glad that the Walt Disney Company, who bought the whole Star Wars franchise, bought it in 1981.
Absolutely, I went to Disneyland a few months ago lol, they were building the star wars land in the tower of terror at the Disneyland, they are building another tower of Terror
Wow that's cool! I wonder how they built it? I love Salvador Dali and he's completely different. I love him and his short film Destino which was created in collaboration with both Disney and Salvador DALI. I wish he would have created it in collaboration instead of built it completely.
No i have not.  Is it good?  I need to see it lol.  I also like to watch Game of Thrones sometimes.  Do you watch it?
I do! Game of Thrones is my favorite series, my favorite character is actually the new one, can't wait until it starts! Do you have a favorite character?
I love Tyrion Lannister, Daenarys Targaryn and Arya.  I am getting dark here...lol.
I do love Tyrwin Lannister actually lol, I think he is dead now lol but I can't really finger him, he's the only one who isn't dead, Daenerys is kind of boring personally, she's got a few names on her, but I love Tywin Lannisters actually lol
Ugh, I dislike Little Finger.  He is so big headed,  he doesnt seem like he would like dragons.  I really like Daenarys though,  she is pretty cool,  and Tywin Lannister was pretty cool too,  but I think she has a boring personality,  Ugh... she doesnt seem very cool, and she does have a boring Personality,  I think,  like she is like a little big headed.
That's what I find kind of silly haha, and the dragons! I like the person that plays the mountain that is indestructible, but that was interesting because I know the dragons were a lot older than him, a lot Older than 150 years old, and he's the person who plays the Mountain, he's actually only 15 years old and is inde the person, that's really interesting I like that
That is crazy!  Great chatting with you!  Have a good one!
Do you wear jeans a lot?
I do, they are my favorite thing to wear, do you have a favorite thing?
I like a bunch of them actually, I think North Face is the best company, they are owned by the same bunch of the same company
Hmm that is interesting. Did you know that New Navy markets jeans with a 36 waist and not a 36?  Hmm I wonder why?
Interesting, I wonder why?  I wonder if they have a tiny pocket for that?
Hmm I do not know, why do you ask? I know blue jeans are ilegal in North Korea.
Hmm good questions. I am not sure.
Probably because they saw it as a sign of american Imperialism.
Wow, I never knew that. I know they are very strict about a lot of things though. I like the tiny pocket watches.
Oh cool. I would have never guessed that. I wonder who invented those? I don't know watches that well.
I wonder if skinny jeans are the one that damages the whole nervous system.
That is pretty scary. Makes sense with all the pressure on the system but still.
Yeah. Do you have a favorite kind of shoes?
I love runners. So comfortable!
Me too. I like to keep them fresh by putting some tea bags in them.
That's a good trick. Do you also know how they tie your shoes?
wow, I guess there are many different ways to do it nowadays!  5000 year old shoes hold their value better than nowadays.  I wonder if shoes hold up?
I wonder how many companies were able to crack that secret and made good shoes from them? Maybe Bill Nye holds a patent on a patent for the pointe shoes used in ballet and other ballet companies.
He is the science guy, wel I guess he can get away with it. Ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes a week, not sure what to think of that. I know I went through 3 pairs of Shoes in my first week, that's way too much.
That is crazy, I wonder if those shoes really cost a lot, or if they cost just for comfort and not for comfort or if it is just because they cost a a lot like some people do like Queen Elizabeth II, she wears $100,000 shoes
I literally can't believe that the queen does that! Nice chat.
Hi, do you like to wear jeans?
Hey there, I love wearing jeans. The small pocket in the larger pocket of your jeans was designed for storing pocket watches, and the small pocket of my jeans was design for storing jeans.
Yes, they were made for storing watches. I wonder why they are made for storage watches?
Yeah, pocket watches are not very popular anymore but they stayed around at the school function for a while.  People were always careful wearing them because they can cause nerve damage.  Jeans are also popular now, but skinny jeans are not, I know people who used to wear them to skinny jeans to school function and they stayed, they did not get nerve damage!
That's crazy.  It's crazy that the company that owns Nautica, North Face, Nauticas, Jansport, Timberland, Vans, VANs, Lee, and Wrangler (and the company is owned by Lee) is also owned by the same company that own North Face.
Wow, I find that kind of odd.  I wonder if they do anything about Navy marketing, like a 6.7 inch waist or a 18 inch waist? I find the Navy marketing to be a little odd.
I find that odd too. Levi's made Bing Cosby a denim tuxedo when he turned up at a hotel in 1977 wearing jeans.  He turned out to be wearing jeans and a tuxetedo.  Did you know that?
Hilarious, that is crazy!  Jeans were invented back in 1853, I think!
I agree. Do you like shoes?
I love them, but they are getting expensive these days. Stephan Marbury promoted a line that retailed at $15.95!
I can see why they are getting expensive. Did you know 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes?
I did not know that! I wonder if that is because old shoes were made to be hard or if they had better odor. I know there is a good trick to that you can put dry teabag and smelly shoes in it to absorb the unpleasant odor. You can put a dry team and smells shoes in there and it will absorb the odor of the shoes.
I didn't know that.  That's a good trick.  How do you think they got it?
Did you see NFL wide receiver Steve Mitch leave his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness to homeless people who can't afford shoes but NFL wide Receiver Steve MitchLeave his cleat on the fields after everygame to raiseawareness to homeless who can not afford shoes
That is pretty amazing of him.  Did you know that professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of ballet shoes per week?  That is pretty much 4 pairs.  I wonder what they look like.
Wow, that is amazing! I wonder how many shoes they went through over a thousand years ago. and how many are still around?
I agree with you. Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis players.
No I did not know that.  I always thought it was invented by polo player.  It's odd that a polo shirt is actually invented by a poli, but not by aPolo player!
I don't know, I would like to know too.
I have no idea but the tennis player who made the polo shirt famous was nicknamed the crocodile, I wonder how he got the idea
It was good chatting with you!
Hey there my friend do you like Star Wars?
I have seen Star Wars, it is one of my favorite franchises.
I have seen a lot.  I think I've seen most of them all orignal ones, but there are still some that haven't been made yet.
Yeah I always thought that Solo was the best Star Wars story. It's interesting that all of the movies started with a lilke the phantom mennace, I thought that solo was the only one that reached the sixth and it's curious how that came about, and why they didn't use a new star wars story when the movies reached the fifth one
That is weird, Rogue One was horrible personally, the last Jedi I thought, but I liked Rogue One the best, the first five were horrible personally
Yeah I didnt like any of them either. Solo wasnt great either. I think that the essence of the franchise is lost. I don't think it can be a really good movie. It is not the same, and yeah I didnt think it was either, I think the whole franchise islost in the essence now
yup I agree with you, do you know how much James Earl Jones was only paid for that movie?
James Earl get paid enough?
I'm not sure.  I know the movie was really depressing.  That was in 2007.
I know right, but George Lucas had a great imagination for surehe had a big influence on James Cameron, I know he had a deal with him to deal with that, also George Lucas also had a huge influence on james cameron
yup I agree, and I hope he did, I wonder how much he made to Star Wars, Lucas' wife got more credit than he did though, she got $75M and only gets 0.01% of the credit
Yes I agree she is a big reason for the success of the franchise, I think its really a success for the both of them,
Yup, she is so iconic, did you see obi wan die when they made the first one?
Yeah that was a nice touch, I bet OBi wan would disagree though lol,
Haha, I know!  Alec guiness hated the character in real life,  lol
I think Obi Wan must agree lol. 20th Century Fox conviced Lucas to get $75,000 for the directing fee and then did it all from scratch.
That would cost the studio billions now, but it would make Lucas massively rich! haha.
Yeah, they must have regretted that decision, a lack of faith cost them millions I guess they deserve it now, and yeah, Game of Thrones is a success, but I think he regretted that Decision
Haha nice, I do like it! Btw, did you know some of the characters are related to Charles Dickens and Charlie Chaplin? That's weird, haha!
Yeah that is kind of weid, I know the actor that plays the mountain is only 20 years old and is kindOf weid at that, he is only the actor, he has been an actor for like 8 years
Wow, that is really young! I remember when he started back in the 80s. Seems like that was so long ago, but it started back before I even got around to it.
Do you like Star Wars?
I love star wars! who doesnt like star wars.
I really like Star Wars. I was surprised to find out that James Earl Jones only spent 2.5 hours recording all of Darth Vader's lines for the new Star Wars "The Last Jedi" and was only given only 2 hours to record the last two lines. I wonder why he only spent 1 hour?
The man got paid a pittance for a voice, but went the perfect choice for the voice. I figure that the movie was so successful because the man got pay.
I bet he was, but you have to give the man some back end points.  I think he got a ton of money off the conventions.  If I was going to go to a convention, I'd want to make it worth my time and the demand to see it.  Give me some money and I'll make it.
Yeah, the man is a man of $1M.  Toys, conventions, movies, toys.  All points for the film company he is about to start.
There are a total of 16 franchise in the US total
That's amazing.  I figure that George started an empire, and these days it's all about evil.
Nice, he bought all the rights to disney for half a gazillion dollars, he could have bought them from disney  for half an gaz Billion dollars
I guess he was bored of being involved with films. I would be bored if I had to do that everyday.
He's a billionaire, he made so much from directing fees, he's made quite a few.
He knew that toys would be worth a lot. He had the foresight to get the money from previous films. He knew that Toys R Us would be the best. He has the money.
I never knew Minnie Mouse's name is short for Minnie, I always knew Minera Mouse was the mouse but I never knew Minerva Mouse's worth more than Minnie's
I wonder why they chose Minerva, the Greek goddess of the greek goddess.
I am not sure.  Maybe Walter Elias Disney, or someone else.
Yes.  Disney has a lot of creative people that have worked for them.
I never knew that!  Pixar actually named Wall-e after him.  That was probably a tip of the hat to him or maybe a tip-of-the- hat to someone else.
That is a great tribute to the man who started it all.. great film, you should watch it, its a great homage to the great film.
Did you know there are only two words spoken the entire film?  Crazy!
That is a fact.  I can see the visuals were better.  Talking was not as clever as the visuals.  Anyway, great chat!
Ditto! Have a great day!
Are you a spiderman fan?  Are you into the spiderverse?
I have seen the remakes, but not the new ones. I have not seen the new remakes.
I'm not really the type.  I like Mary Poppins, but I like that it has Peter Parker in it.  Mile Morales from the Grinch stole Christmas.  He was the main Spidey in the first movie, but he's not in the new one, he's in Mile Morales, the new type.
The Grinch and Mary Poppins are classics of the series.  I guess they'll be updated versions of their versions in this expansion of the "series" with expanded stories.  There are also new versions of the Harry Potter for a younger audience.  But I think the fans of the old stories will like the expansion as well.
True.  I'm not a big comic book fan myself but I know Spider-man was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.  Spider-Man was created in 1939 and the live-action films came about in 1939 so it's definitely a big DC comic book.
I think the basic Spiderman story is pretty flexible. There is a garfiled comic that has been reimagined as a new superhero with a different director and star. I think the director/star can be pretty flexible as well. I found Garfield entertaining.
I have not heard of that, but I think it would be pretty cool.  Soldiers in the US military were able to achieve spider-man like abilities.
I wonder what kind of uniform those troops would have to wear.  I don't understand Hollywood.  Stan Lee was in every Spider Man movie except for the first one.  It would be interesting to see him in life.  He was a different guy in that movie than he is in the new Spider man movie.  And I don'm not sure I understand Hollywood at all.  What kind of uniforms do they wear?
I don't think they were good paydays for the end of the Spider-man animated series.  Joe Perry and the lead guitarist from Aerosmith performed the opening to the first Spider-Man animated series, but Joe Perry was not one of those good payDAYs.  Aerosmusic performed the Opening for the second one.
I guess Joe Perry wasn't a Spider Man fan?  I guess Stan Lee ended up getting $8 million for trying to stay alive.  I think Stan Lee Ended up getting 32 million for "Stay alive!"
It's pretty funny that there was a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes, there should be a comicseries about fixing it
Stan lee reimagined dc comics from behind the scenes putting everything back in place.  people did not think he would do a good job.  he thought there would be too many people and not enough characters.  I guess he was right.  Stan lee's reimagining was steady as a competitor.  DC Comics is now a huge company with over 2,000 people.  He thought he was following a rule that DC Comics had.
I didn't know that. Did you know there are over 300 registered superheroes in the US?
I wonder what superpowers are left out of that?  Who is your favorite superpower?  I do like superheroes.
I love invurnability.  I think it is funny that there is a superhero called "Normalman" who is the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes.  A superhero called normalman is the ONLY person withoutSuperhero on a Planet full of Superheroes.
I think that would be considered cool.  Women might date him because he would be a freak and they would not freak out at the same time.  I would have laughed at the "Normalman" but the women might date the "normal man" because he was considered cool
That's a good point! I also loved Stan Lee! He was such a creative person. He ended every telephone call with the word "excelsior!" He was the only one to do that.
I bet people would call him and say "excelsior" when they did hear that. Marvel trademarked the names superhero and supervillain.
I never knew that.  I know Michigan State University has the largest public comic book collection in the world.  They have it at their Michigan State.
I think the medium is worth the examination of professors. We can learn about american culture from comics and the history of the medium. The history of any medium is Worth the Examination.
Thanks for the chat!  Happy New Year!
I am a spider man fan. Are you?
I am not.  Are you?
I'm a fan since I was a kid, I used to read so many comic books as a kid.
My uncle is big in the comic book industry and he is friends with Stan Lee who created Spider Man.  Did you know that he was friends with Stanley Lee who creation Spiderman?
That is awesome!  I saw Stan Lee in San Diego during a comic con convention.  We crossed paths at a con, and we ended up on the same phone conversation at the end.  I love how he would say the word "excelsior!" at the very end of a conversation with someone who knows Stan Lee.
That's hilarious!  I did not know that, but that's so cool.  I saw that the military used to let soldiers try to achieve spiderman like abilities, to help soldiers.  That's a cool way to achieve Spiderman likeabilities!
That would be neat, did you know DC stands for Detective Comics?
I always wondered that. It's crazy to think that there are more registered superheroes than there are registered superheroes in the U.S.
That is crazy! I think it's neat that U of Michigan State University holds the largest available comic book collection in the world.
That is crazy! Who is your favorite superhero? I like normalman as a superhero, do you have a favorite superhero or a favorite one?
Nice, a person without superpowers.
Yep.  He was boring enough on a planet full of superheroes.  It's a planet that has a planetFull of superheroes!
lol.  Are you familiar with the comic series about fixing collateral damage caused by superheroes?  There is a comic series by that name, lol.
Interesting. There was also a Garfield book series spinoff called pet force that featured Garfield and a gang of heroes. There's also a new Garfield bookseries spinoffcalled pet force 2 that featured the same gang of Heroes.
Neat!  I was a big Garfield fan as a kid, he had a comic book released in the UK called Famous Fights, it was the first comic book ever, I liked it.
I heard it was a reprinting of earlier news comic strips.
Interesting, I think the content was much different.  Did you know Joe Perry from Aerosmith performed the opening theme for the Spider Man animated series?  That's how Joe Perry got his start!
Cool!  I didn't know that either.  Stan Lee actually received the best spider man in 1957.
Wow! Who knew! I think its neat that some soldiers used to achieve spider man like abilities, and the military was using them to achieve Spider man likeabilities for their soldiers.
I guess that way they could swing from place to place and not need tanks and such.
LOL.  Well, it has been nice chatting with you.  Have a good day!
Hi there! Have you ever read Spider-man comics?
No, I watch the movies though.  Spidey six apparently is the bad guy in the bad guys.
Cool. I really enjoyed the first animated one with Miles Morales.
Cool. Spiderman and Mary Jane were actually married in public in 1986.  Marvel acutally dressed up the character in public and had the wedding with actors dressed up as the characters and stan lee officiating, with Spider man as the groom with Mary Jane as the bride.  I wonder if that was before or after the movie, with Lee officiating?
That is really cool.  The character was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.  I never would have guessed that.
I would not have guessed that Spider Man could be married to a soldier.  I wonder if the soldiers in the military used to make Spider-man's abilities so he could be with soldiers.  That would be something!
I would have never guessed the popularity of those characters.  Rock stars like Steve Perry wanted to get in on the action too.  I wonder why?  He's one of the best rock stars.
Stan Lee was also based on the characters. He died before the net profits came in. I wonder if he got any fortune from the characters or if it was all because he died first.
I've heard that money is in legal limbo right now.  The producers claimed that they didn't make any profit, but I heard thatMoney is inlegal limbo, I wonder why.
Well there are over 300 registered superheroes to choose from, so there are many registered superheroes, what is your favorite one?
I loved Pet Force which featured Garfield the cat and gang as superheroes!
That's funny! Stan lee actually wrote 15 DC comics and re-imagined many of the most popular superheroes including batman and superman. What a gem!
He understood the nature of superheroes, possessing supernatural or superhuman powers, but not being superhuman.
He even wrote the comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes.
I don't know but the total damage in American comic book and films is almost unmeasurable in the real world.
I know, it's one planet full of superheroes.  I wonder how much damage it does.  Did you know a person without superpowers that is also a superhero is called normalman, and he is the only person on the planet full with superpowers?
Probably not, but I guess resources are unlimited in those worlds.  Do you like the Marvel cinematic universe?
I like to read comics.  Marvel published a "generic comic book" that would root out the root of every super-hero/super-villain in a comic.  They even trademark the words "super-hero" and "super hero" to trademark the name "superhero".
I like some characters and some not so much.  I love the comic book.  Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world.
I wonder if it stands for detective comics?
I did not know that.  Stan Lee ended every phone conversation with "excelsior!  Batman is the only Batman!
It's too bad about his passing, it was a final goodbye to Lee, but I guess I'll watch for the J. K. Rowling's new movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Get It, it's a good movie, it'll be a final Goodbye to Lee.
Are you a fan of pianos?
I do, but I don't play. They are great though.
Awesome.  I play, but I don't work on my fingers and I can't remotely get close to being able to play.  lol  An aluminum grand piano built for the lounge of the airship Hindenburg was played by someone who actually played.  It weighed only 356 pounds and had a grand piano that had keys that were remotely close to the fingers.  That's awesome!  It must have taken some serious work.
That's not a lot! I would have thought it would be a lot.
I know right! lol  In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of Britain's highest mountain and found a piano.  I wonder if it was still there?  A group of climbing reached thetop of Britain highest mountain  and found
I bet someone was playing a trick on them, right?
lol  Freddie mercury used the same piano to record "Bohemian Rhapsody" as paul mccartney used for "Hey Jude".  That is neat that he was able to do such a task.  I wonder if he used the piano for " Hey Jude"?
That is kind of neat. Instruments are the best instruments, they are like the stars.
I'm not sure.  On April 18, 1930, the BBC decided there was no news worth reporting so they broadcast piano music instead.
I bet that would have been funny to people. I wonder if they were testing auto-pianos or if they just composed it solely for stress stress. Did you know that there exists a song, "Circus Galop" that is not even playable by humans? It is not remotely playable. I bet it was composed for testing and testing auto pianos, or maybe it was solely composed for stress testing.
That's interesting. I like listening to soundtracks. Do you like listening?
Yes, I do. The soundtrack to "O brother, where art thou?" soundtrack is actually certified 8 times platinum!
Phil Collins recorded the English, Italian, German, Spanish, French versions of the Tarzan soundtrack.  That is great talent.
That is some major talent!  Artists have talent that we are totally unaware of or are totally totally unaware about.
It is interesting that the bat from the Batman Begins soundtrack was in the genus or family of bat! I wonder what genus or group of bat it is?
That is very interesting! I wonder how they figured that out?
Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack.
I never knew that! I thought he was a filmmaker, not a filmmaker.  Who would play the clarinet?
LOL  On another subject,  I didn't know that Panda researchers wear Panda costumes to work,  why do researchers wear panda costumes to WORK.  Anyway,  It's been fun chatting!
I love costumes, I think that would be a cool job to have!  Love costumes too!
I know right.  Well I hope you have a great night!
Hi! Are you a fan of listening to soundtracks?
Yes I am.  I loved the Dirty Dancing soundtrack and the Phantom Menace.
lol I love a lot of the soundtracks from when I was a teenager. I am listening to chapters of the Jaws soundtrack now, I am a teenager again. I like listening to Chapters of My Life. Did you know Steven Spielberg played the clarinet on the clarinets for the Jawed soundtrack? lol
I heard that.  I also know that Michael Jackson helped write the sonic 4 soundtrack for that.
I did not know that either.  The soundtrack to the soundtrack of "brother where art thou" is certified 8 times platinum.  Brother where art Thou is certified 9 times platinum
Wow that is crazy, that is an awesome movie. Also the soundtrack to the princess bride, the lead singer of dire straights, was the lead vocals of Princess Bride, that was crazy!
That was a classic! Phil Collins recorded the English, Italian, German, French, Spanish, and French versions of the Tarzan soundtrack.  It is quite a feat, but he recorded the english, italian, german, and spanish versions of it!
Very cool! They released the Phantom Menace soundtrack but when they made a big goof with the plot of the movie, they spoiled it and released the phantom menace soundtrack instead.
I don't know what happened to the Batman Begins soundtrack. I bet the movie company didn't like those songs. Did you know there is a genus or family of bat?
That's pretty cool. Do you know who Alicia Keys is? She did the men in black soundtrack.
That is very neat. Switching gears a little, Capt. Jack Sparrow is a familiar name I am pretty familiar with. Johnny Depp travels with his costumes so he could make sure to make it to hospitals. I wonder if that would be useful for the hospitals?
That is really cool!  I think it would be cool to see Bob Denver go to an island in full costume and have the kids rescue him from an island.  He would probably not go to that island in FULL costume.
Interesting! lol  Panda researchers wear panda costumes to work. lol  panda researchers wear Panda costumes toWork.  lol  I wonder if he was alive when they did that?
I'm not sure, but he's doing a great job so far! I want to meet the guy who dresses up in a giraffe costume and does random acts of kindness, he does this for random acts. I'd love to meet him, I'd do the giraffe costumes.
lol, interesting.  The Hoggle costume from Labyrinth was lost in shipping and now resides in the Unclaimed Baggage Museum in Alabama.  I wonder if the Hoggle Costume from Labyrinth is still there?
That is pretty funny!  They probably had to give it back!  I wonder if they made one of the computer generated "clone trooper costumes" they made for the Clone Trooper costumes?
Interesting, must have been to save a ton of money, the uniforms worn by the alliance on firefly are leftover costumes from Starship Troopers, I wonder why they did that?
I never noticed that.  Hugh jackman once walked around comic con in a full wolverine costume.  I wonder if anyone noticed.
haha ya that is pretty cool, I didn't know that, I do know that Sean bean was really scared of flying, when filming the lord of the rings, he hiked into location in full robes and costume because he was scared offlying, I think he did it in full because he didn't want to be seen, he did do it in the costume though, he was filming the Lord of the Rings, that is a pretty cool one
Wow that is crazy. and he is also a great pianist, I wonder if he can play.
I used to play for a year or two but I don't play now.  I had no idea it was invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700,  I wonder how long it has been around that long!
Richard Nixon was a good pianist as well, he wrote a concerto and performed it, I wonder if that was the same Richard Nixon who was also a good Piano and performed in the US
Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You !
Good morning!  Did you know that the early typewriter was called a "literary piano" or "literaries piano"?
No, I didn't. I guess there are some similarities, lol. Like the same keys?
Yes, exactly.  In England in 1700 a mute man was found wandering around with a typewriter and was able to communicate via piano.  Kind of the opposite of the way a muteMan in the US, mute man, was able  to communicate through a typewrite.
Wow, that's an interesting allegory! The keys are used for forming words and the only way that he could communicate was through them, I wonder how he was able to communicate.
I'm not sure what happened there, but it was interesting to learn. Mozart and Haydn both owned a piano made from a tree and it's interesting to know that they happened to be the first two to have a piano Made from a Tree
I know pianos were made from a rare thing, but from an actual tree, what kind of tree?  What kind of piano?  I wonder what the other pianosWere made of, and if it was a really rare thing.
Yes maybe the actual individual tree, not a whole tree!
Interesting. And it's true that the tree has been around for over 200,000 years, and the DNA tests are even still true after all those years.
I assume they are trying to keep all the piano makers' records on them at the same time.
Hey, did you know that Stephen Spielberg is a fan?
I do.  I think it is cool that his clone trooper costume is a computer generated image.
I did not know that.  I wonder how they did that?  I like the original Star Wars better.
The physical clone trooper costume used in the films was only produced for the prequels. It wasn't produced for any of the films that came out before the prequel.
I know that they did make a couple that were really hard to get right but they did a couple of very close ups with troopers taking off their helmets for every single one, and some close ups of troopers taking them off with their helmets on
That is pretty advanced.  GCI is pretty much advanced these days.
Yes it is. It's much cooler than it was in the 70s. I've seen a couple of Storm troopers outfits on set.
I agree with you on that one. The alien costume included real vertebrae.
Wait, was the actor still inside of it?
Yes it included rolls royce auto parts.
I miss that movie! I hope they make a decent sequel that is not a prequel to the first one, I think it's too early in the universe with the CGI and all the recent parts of the early alien and the prequel, I hope that happens soon and I hope They make a good sequel that uses some of the best recent parts and not CGI
I hope so too. It was great talking with you, I hope you have a good day!
Are you a fan of the Beatles?
Yes I do like their music, their best selling album is the best sellingalbum ever
I find that amazing.  I wonder if it was the first album they recorded or the first time they did it.  Did you know the Beatles stopped touring because sound amplifiers kept the screaming from the screaming on the album they record.
That is very interesting!  I find it fascinatingalso.  I like to read music, especially about the beatles.
I wonder why some major musical stars cannot read music or play it.  I wonder if they had a player piano or something.
I have one too and I have enjoyed it.  I heard that someone found a way to play the piano at the top of Britain's highest mountain.  Wonder if they could play it on top of Britain's highestmountain?
Yeah, I remember reading about it.  It was the one found by a patrol patrol when they found it during a cleanup of the piano used by the Beatles when they were trying to record Bohemian Rhapsody.  I remember the Beatles being known for the piano "Mercury" (Mercury) and "Hey Jude", and "Bohemian Rithmetic" (Bohemia).  Freddie and Freddie were the lead singers for Queen, and Paul paul McCartney was one of the guitarists on "Hey, Jude".  Did you know that McCartney played piano and sang harmony on "Boogie-woogie- do the piano" ?
That would be a cool piano to have knowing how it got there. I wonder if it was on the Hindenburg airship?
It was actually made of aluminum! I wonder if the accoustics was significantly different from a wooden piano. I found it entertaining that the BBC felt the need to broadcasted piano music during the 1948 news report, but found that the news was too much piano music, since they broadcasted so much information on it. I think it was because there was so many news and news report. I would be overload.
yeah I rarely watch the news, it is usually depressing.
It can be depressing, too.  The issue is sorting fact from fiction.  If you have seen a movie or read a book, there is some truth there, but when you embellish and spin it, it is hard to pass off as basic facts.  Fiction is just fiction. It is hard for me to pass up on the truth.
Do you like science fiction?
I do.  I actually finished the Harry Potter book series a few years ago in order.  It was the firstHarry Potter book I had ever finished, so I really liked it.  Robert Parker, the author, is a great writer.  The first Harry Potter books were all done in order, but I like the second and third books the best.  Jesse Stone, the writer of the law/crime series, has done a book about a law school professor who became a professional criminal prosecutor years ago.
I am!  It is good!  Did you know Edgar Allen Poe was a fictional cyborg and he wrote the oldest known fictional cy Reborn?
Those are really good.  I was never much of a fan, I liked the original Jesse Stone, but the new ones are very good. Robert Parker died unexpectedly and was the author of the original fiction novel, The Last of the Original Jesse Stone.  After his death, I think many fiction novels are doing poorly because of the death of the author.
Yeah. I think that fan fiction is copyright infringement and a bad exercise for people wanting to become writers. Like Geroge RR Martin said, "fan fiction isyright infringement."
I totally agree with that. Do you ever read superhero? I like comics, but I have never really read superhero novels.
I used to when I was younger.  I watch marvel series on netflix.
I recently found a wiki website online that ranks all the fictional "characters" (fictional) powers and abiliites of various genres according to their powers andAbiliites. I think this is highly subjective and not for everyone.
Interesting. I'll have to check it out when I'm done here. Julius Caesar liked fan fiction and wrote fan fiction of Hercules and Oedipus as a kid.
My imagination is always learning to write, whether it is learning to writing about my favorite hero or villain.  I am like a child fantasizing about my own imagination, like the Beatles when I was a child.  Even as adults, my creativity has drifted away to music and compositions, like music and original fiction, as I have drifted into my own creativity over time, like my favorite Hero or Villain.  Who is your favorite Hero/Villain of all time?
I like the song Come Together, catchy, but not written for politics, too bad it wasn't that catchy. I think it's a song that could have been written for music.
Hi there, are you a fan of the Beatles? I just learned they have the best selling album ever!
I'm not a huge fan, but they were so influential a few decades ago that they were writing for governor campaigns and had writing for Governor campaigns.  Crazy.
What song are we talking about?
Yes, I read it was from the Beatles.  I'm not really sure of the details though.
That's surprising, I don't think I've ever read music they made, do you?
They probably didn't care to adopt the new technology.  They were stuck with music and the loud screaming.  amplification would have drown them out.  I think they stopped touring because they didn't want to drown them with the loud, loud screaming, which is why they stopped.  Now they are just using amplification.
I would be interested in seeing the studio used. I would be more interested in the unconventional way they used recording techniques.
Yeah they had a lot of setbacks too.  Ringo Starr had severe suberculosis and peritonitis that was out of control and it affected his ability to write music.  I wonder if he was affected by them.
Speaking of writing, I read this article that says Edgar Allen Poe wrote the earliest known example of a cyborg in fiction, I didn't know Edgar Allen Poe wrote about a cyberborg in Fiction, did you read that?
Wow, I had no idea.  Interesting where inspiration in fiction comes from!  It goes back that long.  Julius Caesar actually wrote fan fiction for fun and I wonder if that was in fiction too.
Speaking of fan fiction, did you see George R.R. Martin rage over fan fiction?  lol  He said it was copyright infringement!  I don't think I could get into all that, but it does seem like George R R. R. Martin's rage over Fan Fiction.
Interesting. People hate on fiction. A judge in the 1960s tried to ban a comic for featuring a black character. Now people hate on Fiction. Wonder how much time he had to do that.
Wow. that's crazy.  There is a wiki that ranks them all and Superman is the only super power that is not a super power.
haha I should look at the wiki before making an opinion haha, on a different note, are you interested in instruments? I am interested in musical instruments, but not really into them, I would have to look at that wiki before made an opinion on that one
I know a little bit about them. I like watching people play them. Mostly stringed musical instruments, like the piano and the stringed instruments, but I like playing them as well.
Yeah, it is beloved by many. The BBC once thought that it broadcasted piano music because it was newsworthy.
haha that is awesome, I read somewhere that there is a song that can only be played by humans, I wonder if it exists? I would like to test the piano to see if it still exists, I also read that there's a song which can't be played, I think they should test that haha
I wonder how they test that! It's funny the lengths people go to to test pianos. There is a piano lounge on Hindernburg that has an aluminum grand piano.
Wow, I guess they have to find pianos where ever they can. I've heard there is one at the top of the Britain's highest mountain, I wonder where they find piano's on the top.
I found it very interesting that a group of people discovered an old hindenburg piano.  It was the hindenburg's piano.
I'm not sure.  I wonder if the Hindenburg had one.  Maybe it just fell apart when it fell off?
Hello! Are you a fan of reading fiction?
I am!  I love Edgar Allen Poe.  I think he's the best!
I think he was awesome. I loved the Raven. It's crazy how far technology has come since then. He coined the word cyborg. That was so limited back then.
I agree. Julius Caesar also wrote fan fiction.  Do you read much?
I havent either, I wonder if its interesting to read, did you hear that a judge tried banning science fiction, that would be interesting to reads, did not know a judgeTry banning science Fiction
I did not know that, I wonder if it was because it featured a black character like the black panther LOL, or if it even featured a white character
LOL, he is wrong about that. Do you play any instruments?
No I don't, but I love piano music. I would loved to hear the BBC broadcast piano music show back in the 50s, I would have loved to see someone play the piano! Do you play the Piano?
I wonder who played them?  I wonder if Freddie Mercury used to play them? He played the same piano that Paul McCartney used when he started playing his own songs.  I think that piano is a good party trick to bust out a hit like the song "Bust Out" by Freddie Mercury and it is the best hit ever.
I would love to play that piano! I would love it to play Bohemian Rhapsody. I would also love to plays that piano
I would love to learn how to do that too! I would love that too. I like the Beatles.
I loved them as a kid, I think I was born in 1968 but I can't believe they formed in 1964, I was only born in 1969, I loved them when they came out!
I didn't either, amazing.  It's interesting that you like to read music,  its so interesting to me.  Do you read music?
I think Ringo Starr was illiterate due to a childhood illness.
Wow,  he didnt know what an illness was?  I didnt know that either.  I wonder how life was different for him then due to that illness.
I'm not sure, I know his career is over now and has the best selling album of his career!
Awesome!  Do you know the song "We Are Together"  It was released in 2001 and is the best song
Good question!  I would love to know, they experimented with musical styles so much.
I agree, I can't believe how far technology has come, I wonder if they stopped touring after they stopped screaming lol
I understand that.  The song "Do the Right Thing" was written in 1972.
Nice chatting with you! Take care!
Hi, hows it going? Do you like the piano? I've been playing for years
I do like the piano!  I like the Beatles,  do you like them?
There is, it's an electric piano.  It was made for the California governor's campaign.
Yeah, sounds good. Is Timothy Leary a drug guy?
I dont know.  I dont really read music.  The Beatles are the only one I know of that I like.
I did not know that, I wonder if Ringo Starr read at all?
He was illiterate in his childhood, I think.
Yes, he was screaming.
lol  The screaming stopped after they were done touring and went on to do more.  lol  The Screaming stopped in 1972.
I wonder why? I wonder why it did?
I love Edgar Allen Poe, but I don't think he did fiction, do you?
Yeah, Poe is great! I've read some William Tenn, too. I think I read some Williams Trevor.
That was Julius Caesar right? He was a very goodWriter,
Yes.  I like a lot of women characters in some of his stories.  He and trevor had a lot.
Maybee the Greek goddesses. It's sad that a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it had a black character.
I read about it. It is very, very sad.
I think he couldn't either lol. I remember reading Edgar allen poe's work on the cyborg in high school.
I know, he was ahead of his time.  I like Hey Jude and Bohemian Rhapsody.
Those were both excellent songs. Ringo was my favorite beetle!
Yeah. Did you know that there is a piano that has been there since 1700? they found it atop Britain's highest mountain
I would love to see them play the circus galop song, I love it! Nice chatting with you have a good night!
Hello, how are you?
I'm great!  Do you play music?
i do, i enjoy the piano, but dont know how to play it.  do you?
I used to play piano growing up!  It is able to make some great music.
The piano was invented in 1700 by Bartolomeo Cristofori.
Wow! I never knew that, that long ago and that I heard one time that a group of hikers found a piano on the top of Britains highest mountain. I wonder if the group was hikers from long ago, I heard that they found it on top of Britain's highest mountain!
Wow I didnt know about that I wonder what they did there, I wonder if it was worth reporting, did you know that the bbc broadcast piano music on April 18th, 1930?
I would rather listen to some piano music on a hike, or maybe listen to the news for a few days lol.
The Hindenburg used to have a piano, and it was made out of aluminum and only weighed 356 pounds. It was the same piano that was made for the Hindenburg, it was only 356 pounds!
I did not know that.  I wonder if on the Hindenburg the blimp that went down with it was engulfed by flames?
Yeah it was. They used hydrogen to make it float and then used hydrogen and other hydrogen to made it float.
Wow.  I wonder if that survived the flames.  Some good soundtracks have been burned,  I would listen to them if they burned down.
I do, there are a couple really catchy songs in there, like the Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack, certiied 8 times platinum.
I loved it, I bought it, and I bet they won't believe that, it is amazing and catchy, I think the movie was ok but I never bought it.
Did you ever hear the Batman Begins soundtrack? Did you know bat are a genus or family of bat?
I have heard about that,  I think I will check it out lol,  its a good soundtrack,  Tarzan has a soundtrack too,  have you seen it,  it was a good one,  check itOut lol
I have never heard of it, but I think it's good. It's in English French and Germanso ar.ill be the only language beore I die.
Wow, I never knew Phil Collins was a big part of so many languages, he sang in so many different languages!
I don't speak any of those languages but my son is.  He must be pretty darn intelligent to be able to speak those.  It would have been a good soundtrack.
My daughter loves it.  I'm not a big fan of the movie myself, but I like Tarzan.  She thinks Jane is the best, but she's not a fan of Tarzan, lol.  Well, nice chatting with you!  See ya!  Have a good one!
Nice chatting with you too!  Have a good night!
Hi, the article was very good to read.
Very interesting to read some facts about movies.  Are you a movie lover?  Are they about the box office?
I am not sure I know that many facts about them.  I am close to the last one though.
I find it fascinating how much these movies really speak to us as a society.  They are so closely related and yet are released so far apart.  I think that is because the politics and problems that they are released in are so different but the movies reallyspeak to how closely related they are to our society.
Do you think that current society has gotten better with movies like that?
Yes, the #MeToo movement has definitely influenced the movies, good and bad. I think it released its first one this year.
I think it can be good and bad.  I think it's definitely an issue
I think movies bring about conversation about important topics.  Society on the other hand, on the hand, is not always willing to hear about the problems in the society.  So, movies bringAbout conversation about it.  I think movies have a deeper meaning than just a mindless action movie.  If we don't have problems in society, we can still watch a mindlessAction movie and not hear about them.
Yes, you can watch it deeper if you want to watch it, but I like the deeper meaning of it.
A lot of people think that movies like these are an awards show and not much interest to them.  They feel that it is a waste of time and that it has become a political platform, but I don't know, movies can be an awards Show but I feel like it is more of a waste.
I think that they are worth seeing, but just watching a shows like that is not worth doing, I don't really like it.
It's funny how they talk about how they can talk about the box office, yet as far as movies are concerned, the numbers always sound so outrageous. I can't fathom the amount of money they earn in just one weekend, let alone the amount they make at the boxoffice. The numbers alwaysSound so outrageous to me.
I don't either.  Comedy shows always show a good concept.
I do like comedies.  I think they are fun to watch and they tend to have a deeper meaning than some other genres.  Some of them are light hearted and others can have a more serious, deeper meaning.  Comedies are much less fun to do at the box office in comparison to other genres, which I enjoy since they are more light heartedly.  But they do do do better at the Box office in Compared to other genre's
I don't know about that, but they are good.  I do like them.
Yes it was, it's interesting to see a singer cross the lines into acting from their music, I heard there was a good movie recently with Lady Gaga, music is very interesting, did you see that movie recently?
Lady Gaga does have a good talent for sure.
I didn't realize that she did a remake of the older movie, A Start is Born, I think it was a remake or something, was that an older movie?
I did not. I didn't know that.
I recommend it, I am thinking I have seen the movie but not yet, I think most people will like it, do you recommend it?
I like how the character acted, I think he was the best.
I enjoyed talking about movies.
Same here! Thanks! I will!
bye! I'm going to go look into this
Do you like Juliacuso?
Yes that is the most decorated women skier ever, she is the only one
I think she has been to the Olympics since she was 15 and is retired from the Olympics.
I did not know that! I wonder why, who would decide to do that?
I think it is a hip injury.
Yes, he wanted to go to the olympics and fought to the end.
I didn't know that.
I was happy to know that her husband supported her despite many people who questioned and doubted her.
I'm sure it was good for him.
I realized that it's such an emotional time for the body. Hard to believe it's been so hard on her body.
I bet.  She released a line of lingerie at one point.
haha I did know that, it was called Kiss My Tiara, sounds kind of like femine and fast, I think it has double meanings like "fast" and "femine" it sounds kind to me, so there are double meanings there,
Did you know that the fifa world cup is in 2022?
Yes, I do. The US competed in the first fifa world cup and got 3rd place in 1930
I didn't know that.  The city that is hosting the 2022 final doesn't even exist as yet.  What city is it hosting?
Yes I wonder why though.  The cities that host the world cup usually have no economic gain from it.  There is usually no economic benefit to the cities thathost the world Cup.
Did you know that woman have been the best woman in it since 1991?
I know that Gal Gadot did some testing for Catwoman before actually auditioning for it, I thought that was for CatWoman.
Wonder Woman first appeared in 1941 as a secretary to a member of the Justice Society and later a member herself.
Yes, she was Israeli! She had to serve two years as a soldier, which helped her in her role as a role since she was helped by the soldier
I'm not sure! What did she do for it?
I watched the film and will check it out. I will check out the first one. Have a good day!
Hi there, do you follow soccer?
My husband is not a soccer aficionado.  I went to a game a couple of years ago when I was bored.  He went to the San Jose Earthquakes game a few years ago because they built a stadium nearby.  They have built a Stadium nearby for a soccer Aficionado, but I did not go to the game.
I agree with you. I don't understand how they can be exciting when a city that does not exist for the rest of the world doesn't even exist yet and the world clearly loves it.  The next World Cup will be in 2022, I understand.
I guess it was in 2022? Qatar is building a city to host it so that's pretty amazing. I wonder if a woman will be the first woman to host, though.
I haven't seen it. I thought it was good but not great. I'm not a huge superhero movie person. I would like to see it though. Wonder woman is going to get some huge superheroMovie money with all that superhero movie money!
I did not, but I know my granddaughter imagined Wonder Woman everywhere saving people. In fact, it was the highest grossing domestic female led films of all time period, in fact, and the highestgrossing female-led film period.
That's great, I wonder why that is the highest grossing. I'm surprised it wasn't her. Maybe we should encourage the studios to make more movies with women, that would be great!
It would be a stretch to call it the best WWII movie, in my opinion. I think the fictitious superhero movie would show more soldiers in battle, but that's just my opinion, but the WWII movie would be better.
You would think so!  They call it a female led movie, but I think they should call it "Hot Tin Roof" because it's in the South Pacific.  It's about a cat and his hot tin roof.  I think Paul Newman will be in it.  He's a cat person, but he's from the South.
That's a good point.  On a different note, one of the first woman was Justice Society's secretary.  Things have changed since then.
A lot of things have changed.  Gal Gadot is beautiful, and I bet she got a kick out of that.  She served in the Israeli army and I think she was in real life.
Absolutely. It is believed Mar's largest moon is actually artificial in origin, I think they put a little bit of a dig in it, but it is believed mar's largest Moon is actually 2.7 miles in diameter, so they probably put it there to be artificial inorigin
That is interesting and I'm curious as well, it is probably hollow, but not sure. I wonder why it is there.
Speaking of the moon, did you know that there were private rockets that went to the moon before the first one? That would sign up you for all the money you needed to get there. I wonder how much money you had to get to the Moon?
I would, but I would need a lot of convincing that it is safe. I think there is still some way to go before they prove it.
I think it would be fascinating to see how our journey has changed since USA planted its flag on the moon and the journey has change since USA placed its flag in the moon
I'm fascinated that moon dust can cut through kevlar-like material, to my ear.  To my knowledge the moon is made of nothing but that stuff, and I'm fascinated to know that moon Dust can cutthrough kevlars-like Material.
I wonder what is up with that? And what happens to the wax in the ear?
Oh I meant the Earth. Have you heard of Moon Hay Fever?
I suppose you should worry about that when traveling.
good talk to you!  Have a good one
Did you know that gender and race are equally worthy of attention in judging films?
I think both are very important issues and essential to the progression towards equality, but I think it is more about the progression of the issues andessential to a better society
I think there have to be different factors that are used on an equal basis when making awards like the Oscars, but I would think there would be more than just an equal level of awards. I think that there should be more awards.
I think that is important, I think movies present the issues and bring awareness so those factors should be considered on an equal basis, and I think all movies present them on an unequal basis, but those are the most important.
I agree, I think the box office draw is probably considered more than the Oscar evaluation.
I think the Oscars have an impact but I don't know how much.
I think it would have an impact, people like to see movies that are free for the most people. I would not pay for a critics right to see my movie. I think I would pay for something better for free.
True,  but I hate u give that away.  I want films that present social justice issues to be watched by the public.  There have been many films thatpresent social justice Issues to the public, but they are not watched.
I missed some of those kinda on purpose, I'm not really the type to keep up with documentaries or that type of thing, but I did see one or two of those, what about you?
I think the social justice movies are kind of depressing. Most of the movies I watch are cartoons for my kids, so those movies are pretty much the same.
I don't care for animation. I like action adventure, drama and sci-fi, but not horror, I can see it if it's Ferdinand.  I don't really care for drama and Sci-Fi but I like them.
did you watch the oscars?
Not as much as I used to but I do go every day for the red carpet.  How about you?
Man I don't think I've watched it since "The gun" is a 2018-2019 Oscar hopeful, have you?
I have not seen it.  Have you?
It looks like it's about a 17 year old making an escape from San Quentin and conducting various heists. It looked like a heist but it's actually a 17 years old making a escape from san Quentin and conduct various heist.
Yeah I think I remember hearing about that, it seems very appealing, but I don't remember hearing much more about it.
I bet it is filled with a lot of action and a lot with a LOT of action. It sounds quite humorous though.
I didn't realize that they were doing a comedy aspect of it.  You should check out Rotten Tomatoes to see if it's on there.  Check out RATINGS!
Man, I thought it was funny too, it was actually a comedy with some action. He was pulling off lots of heists after escaping from prison.
I like action but I think it glorifies criminals. I think there are better ways. Hey, it was nice chatting with you, thanks for the action!
Hi there. Do you like the box office?
Not too much, just the fact I was recently studying about the box offices.
I know a little bit.  I know that Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star at $8.5 billion worldwide in film earnings.  He is the second highest all of all- time box officestar in film.
The guy has a golden touch. He is a money machine. If he could stand up to that guy, the money would flow. He has the golden touch, and he has done almost every film.
I agree! Disney once thought about shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping beauty was a box office failure.
I guess they expected it to make money again. Animation has a long curve, and animated films have been popular for decades, so I guess they expect to make more.
The movie The Trojan Wars came out in 2007 and earned over $270 million at the box office.  With a budget of about $15 million, talk about a failure at thebox office. Talk about being over the budget.
I can't predict what Hollywood execs would do if they could.  That's insane!  The original Star Wars trilogy out-earned the prequels by over $300 million in domestic box office, adjusted for inflation, and the original trilogy has out- earned the prequel trilogy by over 100 million in the US box office.  I think that's insane.
Wow that's crazy. Disney's treasure planet was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time, $309,000,000. It was one the most Expensive box office Flops of All Time!
I wonder how many lost their job.  John Carter was also considered a monumental flop for Disney.  It broke box office records in Russia, where it was the first one to do so.  They even broke records in that country.
wow that's pretty cool. The silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day and had a box office of over $270 million, that was on valentinine's Day.
I saw it too! I had dread over it. There was nothing but blood. The perfect V-Day movie.
Haha I bet, I like birds too!
Yes!  I like them!  But not enough to eat them! lol
lol  I don't like pigeons either.  Did you know that the dodo bird, the dodos are actually a sub-family of the pigeon, the pigeon is actually a dodoBird.  lol
Oh, really, that's dumb. I guess it just runs in the family of the dumb.
lol, I guess.  Some birds fly from Alaska to Northern Mexico without sleeping when they are migrating.  I don't think I could do that.  Most birds fly to where they are going.  How do they do it?  I guess there are some birds flyFrom Alaska to northern Mexico without sleep?
That is amazing, I can't understand how they fly without sleep, how can they do it?
That is an amazing feat.
Did you know that pigeons are the only birds that produce milk for their young. I always thought that only birds produced milk, but I wonder if they were mammals like other mammals? I wonder what birds produced Milk.
Wow, I didn't know that either. It was great talking to you!
Hello! How are you?
Good, you? How are you?
I'm doing well, do you ever watch the Olympics?
I do, I hear that Juliacuso retired she was a great skier, she was like the best ever,
I did hear about that. She will be missed.  It sounds like a really good one!
Yes she will!  I remember her from so long ago.  She was so good, even though her body wasn't too good after her hip surgery in 2007.  I can't believe she was able to go to games, even after that hip surgery.
Lindsey Vonn just retired, announced it.  There will be a leadership vacuum in the skiing for a while, but it sounds like it will be filled soon enough.  If she has announced it, there will be.  I think there is a leadership gap to be filled.
Yep, it's crazy to me. It just goes to show that athletes endure so much and it's hard to compete when you have other greats waiting in the wing, it goes to shows the show thatletes endure even when you think you're going to go under...
I think a lot of ex-football players have to worry about their long term health.  They have a lot more brain issues and probably a lot  of physical pain, so a lot.  A lot of former players have a whole lot of physical and brain issues.
They have a rough life but they have to keep trying to do something with their body and train every second of their day to try and get better. It is hard to beat, but it is hard!
Yeah, it is, and it takes a long time to get back from a game season, a lot of the baseball has a long recovery time, like 4 months to recover from a 162 game season.
Imagine, sprinting around, stopping, stopping and getting tired, and then recovering and then again recovering after the next game.  I bet that takes a toll on you.  Watching the World Cup makes me think about soccer and the players.  That's a hard time to get through.  They played so many games in 2010.  It was the first ever world cup to be played.  The whole time I was watching the World cup, the players were still moving.  Imagine, they were sprinting, stopping.
Yeah, they run about 7 miles a game!
Yes about 10 miles.  I know that they have to be in incredible shape to do that.  They need to be running around, running and then driving after that.
Yeah they sure do. Gal Gadot is really well known for being the best woman in the movie "Wonder Woman"
I have not, I was wanting to see it for a while but I haven't had time, but I am wanting to now.  It is pretty good.
Yeah, I thought gadot was perfectly cast and I really enjoyed it. She talked about how much she enjoyed it
I will have to check it out.
Yes, it is the highest grossing super hero origin movie and the third highest grossed super heroOrigin movie!
Wow, that is awesome! I didn't know that.  It's good to finally have a female superhero in the spotlight and I think that it is good toFinally have a "wonderful" female superhero.
Nice chatting with you!  Have a good one!
Hi!  Do you like birds?
I love hummingbirds! I had no idea that they steal spiderwebs to make their nests.
C cunning little thieves, I guess, but they flit around so quick to stop them, lol.  The cunning little Thieves arent always so quick.  I guess they are quick to try.
They are tiny!  In birds their bones are hollow and their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers.  In some birds their Bones are so tiny, their entirekeleton weighs less that their feathers!
That makes sense, hollow bones are lighter and more stronger, its interesting how evolution produced us with hollow bones, the bones are heavier and stronger,
I prefer flying JetBlue over flying from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping while migrating as a bird.  I'm a skydiver so I would prefer flying from Anchorage to Mexico over flying like a bird
Imagine how birds do it, they have a calm sleeplike state.
That must be tiring for sure, especially a long flight.
I can't think of anything worse than flying in economy class.  I don't have that much stamina.  It's cute though, how they can imitate machines and stuff.  You have to respect the birds and have torespect themselves.  They can do worse than Flying in Economy class.
Parrots are great imitators!  They are also great at insulting firefighters,  like insulting firefighters on the rescue.  Parrots are also on facebook.
That's not great! But hey, I bet the firefighters appreciated it. They were trying to save it and that was great!
Hahahahahha  I want to talk to Alexa, I think I'll go watch some tv now.  I can't sell tickets to parrot shows at the box office.  How do you sell tickets for a parrot?  I don't know how to sell tickets.
lol. that would be funny. I dont think I would go for that. Do you know Lady Gaga by the way?
I do like her a lot but my autocorrect says her name a lot.
That is so funny! I think she is going to sing on "Lady Gaga: Iron Maiden" she is so old.
She's very popular, so popular in fact, that LAPD asked her to tweet out info about road construction once when they needed to tweetOut info aboutRoad construction.
That's good thinking.  The LAPD is doing its good thinking there.
Yes, I think so.  She is the type of person who would help out a lot.  Elton John chose her to be his son's godmother.  I can't believe Elton's chose her.
It does, musicians do have so much respect for each other and for themselves. Anyway, great chat!
Yes, and she was on MTV before she was famous
I think she pursued success, she is not one to let anything go. Well, have a good day.
Thanks you too. You too!
Did you watch the new Wonder Woman movie?
No, I haven't seen it, but I heard some good things.
Gal gadot was the star of it and was in the talk show circuit promoting the movie on the talk shows.
I saw some of the first movies she was in, I bet she did a great job in that part, I liked the first one the best.
I know she was in Batman vs Superman, Wonder Woman, and Wonder Woman.
I bet she was, I think there are a lot of superhero films that she was in. She is a good athlete, she is a really good athlete.
She served two years in the Israeli defense forces, trained for combat and was trained forCombat.
She's tough and gorgeous!  She is the perfect combo for wondrous women.  Tough and gorgeous,  perfect combo.
The box office loves her as well. She was the highest grossing superhero origin movie and the highestgrossing superheroOrigin movie!
I heard that.  It's great!  It messed up that she appeared in the Justice Society, but she was not a member of that group made up by the group.  She appeared as a member but was not their secretary.  I wonder if that messed her up.
I think they didn't want the paperwork wet.  Wonder why they thought she was auditioning for "Aqua Man" or "Wonder Woman?"  I know Gadot was also going to be catwoman.
I dont think she was going for catwoman, she was for Michelle Pfeiffer, right?
I agree, I haven't seen that movie in a while, I'm sure it's going to be in anytime soon, I would like to see the howl of the wolf, or the moon or some other movie.
I did not. wait. was Jack Nicholson in it?
Ooooooo...I don't know.  The moon is the Earth's only permanent natural satellite and it's been around for eons.  Earth has had moon's for eONS.  But the moon has never had wolfs.  I don't think I've ever been to a moon that has wolfs howling at me.
I know! I am a fan of the moon! I howl at the moon.
Did you know that there is evidence of methane based life on Titan, a moon of Saturn?  I wonder if that means there is life on titan.  There is another moon of saturn that may have life too.
We could send some people there. I guess it might be safer than trying to go there ourselves. Moon dust cuts through kevlar-like material and is harmful to humans.
If they send us to Mars, we could send us there to Phobos, Mars's largest moon.  It's hollow, but it's cool that the inside is so hollow
I figure that space exploration would be the next step for humankind. Great chat!
Yeah, the fifa world cup is the future of american sports. Nice chatting with you too!
Oh boy, I hope we as a country can get more soccer in this country. Have a good night, thank you!
Bye bye!  You too!
Do you like the library?
Yes, my 7 year old loves it.
Good for them.  Children love libraries.
Did you know that ships visiting ancient Alexandria had to surrender their books.  I wonder if they got a copy of the copy they did?
Interesting. There are more libraries than McDonald's in the US.
Hah, that is a good thing. I wonder how Waldo would like that?
I did love Waldo growing up, but it's been a long time!
Apparently he shows up at certain locations, and you can predict where he is and find him, but can't predict where else?
Interesting. Do you like literature?
I do. A doctor in west texas teaches heavy metal as literature.
Cool! In the act of US censorship, the FDA burned six tons of literature in the 1930s.
That is very weird. Apparently Stephen King wrote a childrens book with a pseudonym and reviews under that name, apparently Stephen King
Interesting, did you know winston churchill won a nobel price for literature?
Yes, I think he wrote 13 novels!
I would be curious to see it, too.
Fonz was a dyslexic character and he wrote a best book childrens series about it.
Wow that's interesting.  I didn't know that.
He modeled a character after a teacher who helped him get into reading.
Cool, good for him.
Yes.  I used to go to the library more but now I just use rented dvds.  Do you like books?
I have not but I would like to.  Good talking to you!
Do you like literature and great libraries?  Do you think we should all have access to more access?
Yes, I do think it is wonderful!  In 1950, the FDA burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship, that is so terrible!
That's awful.  There are more libraries in the world than McDonalds restaurants!
wow, that is good to know.
I agree, more than half of adults have library cards now, that is almost half of Adults have library card.
Hey, I wonder what adults are up to now? LOL I know I'm one of those adults.
That is pretty cool!  Library of Things was started in Sacramento.
It is kinda cool, they can rent out the items,  and you can also take some with you.
Yes, but they have items like sewing machines and things people find useful but do not want long term ownership.  I wonder how they know if someone really wants the items like sew machines and such.
There are annual contests amoung authors to come up with a worse opening line to a book, I wonder if it is one of the annual contests  amouing authors?
That sounds like a fun one for the most part, I wonder who got in on that?
I wonder if painting and sculpture were olympic events for awhile lol. Architecture, literature, music, painting and painting and sculptures were o Olympic events for a while.
We should bring that back! Did you know that UK prime minister Gladstone, a boy, donated all his personal book collection to the library by wheelbarrowing 32,000 books to the Library by wheeling them in as a book collection?
Wow, that is amazing!  Too bad they couldnt find a way to secure it to transport the books,  or at least secure them.  Winston Churchill was a little too secure lol,  too amazing.
I guess he was not familiar with it, but wishes that he were, I am not familiar enough to guess.
Did you know he got a Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953?
Interesting, I know that is considered a "Peace" Prize.
Yeah, I hear if you publish a book in Norway the government buys 1000 and they donate to libraries.
That sounds pretty generous!  How do they do that?
Funny, Dr Seuss's editor lost the bet that he couldnt write a book of over 400 words in 50 words or less, and he could write a novel!  He couldnt, so the Dr Seussian editor lost that bet lol
I wonder how he bet on that?  Children's books have more rare words than average adult ones and more rarewords than average Adult ones.
That's hilarious! lol  Thanks for the info!  Great talking to you lol  I will look it up later.
Hello, do you use libraries?
I love libraries. How about you?
I'm doing great!  How are you doing?  There are more libraries than McDonald's in the United States.
We love our fast food, but not our reading.  I wonder what they would combine if they did.  We like our fast money, but we don't want to read.
I agree! I would like to see that
McDonalds also has a library section that is great for the library, not a fast food section like the fast food Section.
haha ya I know right? What about literature, do you like literature?
I do like literature. I think it helps keep people smarter. I do not understand it but I understand it though.
In the act of US censorship, the FDA burned six tons of literature in the 1960s.
That is appalling.  I wonder what else the gov't wants us to read?  I can't decide how I would decide what I would like to read.
I agree with you, that is appalling, I had no idea lol.
The job of gov't should encourage people to read widely, children especially, but the job of GOv't is not to encourage people, its to help.
I think so.  Romantic kissing is a fairly recent development, and is rarely mentioned in the ancient greek literature.  I wonder why it is rarely seen in the modern literature.
I can't imagine what it was like to be there when people's breath was stanking!  I can only imagine it was when people breath was so bad.
I can't imagine that either.
Go figure. Humans can be found in literature for many kinky secrets. I wonder if kissing is one of them. Kissing is so unnatural that it can't be found.
If you publish a book in Norway, the government will buy 1000 copies and distribute them to libraries across the country.  I wonder what they are used for.  The government will Buy 1000 copies of your book in Norway.
I will move to Norway, marry a beautiful woman, write many children's book and publish it here, then move to Norway.
lol, sounds like a good idea!
My kids can read my books. LOL. Anyway, great chat!  See you later.  I'll let you know if my kids can reads them.
It was good talking to you too!
Hello!  Do you like comedy films?
I love comedy films!  What is your favorite comedy?
I love them all, but some of my favorites are Step Brothers or Pineapple Express, bromantic comedies.
Pineapple express is very funny. I like Evan almighty a lot.
I heard that movie costed a lot of money to make, $15,000,000.
I think it was $25 million, that is insane considering the budget, and the fact that it is a comedy and it had a comedy with a budget of $25million in the fact.
Wow that is insane! I remember when it came out there were tons of big names in it and Bill Murray was in it.  It was a good movie, but it didn't have Bill Murray.  He is insane.
I love Bill Murray.  Any movie suggestions that do not involve comedy?
I do like Bill Murray's film "Blade of Glory" it's a classic, and I like kung fu hustle, I didn't know that at the end of it was actually a Bill Murray film, did you? blades of glory is a classic.
I have, it is a classic and very funny movie
Yes!  Comedy gold.  Especially Bill Murray.
I agree, did you know that comedies were once in silent movies?
Amazing! Charlie Chaplin was great, he would talk to make people laugh!
Yes, and to correct those types of movies which do not require any sound whatsoever, it is more visual and does not require Any sound whatsoever.
Do you like comedians?  I don't really.
I don't mind them.  What about you?  Do you like comedians?
I like Demetri Martin and Ryan Stiles I think they are very successful and funny. I saw that he didn't drop out of high school like he did law school, he actually went to law school.
Wow, originally the Green Lantern was suppose to be a comedy.
LOL, I didn't know that.  That movie was blah.  I think they made it ok, but that was it.  Wasn't Ryan Reynolds supposed to do it?  I don't think that would have made it better.
Jack Black was suppose to start in the movie too.
I wonder how much they paid him?  I'm sure he didn't make much.  They probably didn't need to make more that he got paid for it lol.  It was so nice chatting with you.  I hope you have a great night!
Hi, do you like Shakespeare?
I dont know that much about Shakespeare, but I know that he lay some wisdom down there somewhere.
I guess he is commonly known as the inventor of the impasse, hoping that is what you are commonly known for hoping.
Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the words we use today. He created a ton of words and phrases we use now, he created a bunch of words we don't even know about.
I guess we owe him a lot of those words. He wrote some comedies too, I'm told. I guess he liked to laugh. He even wrote some comedy novels.
Yeah, I bet you can.  I dont know how well they work.  Modern pronunciations, accent, and modern pronunciATIONS, along with era-appropriate puns and puns take on different meaning when performed in a different culture or setting.  Introduce rhymes that are era- appropriate, like introducing rhymes with slang, works well in that setting.
Sounds like it. I think I will go go look for a DVD and watch some Bill Murray now, he does work well with that accent. He always goes out with a bang.
I'm thinking on Kung Fu Hustle. I figure Bill is a more modern man, so I would agree with his thinking onKung Fu HustLE, but he's a little too old for my taste.
I don't know.  I am guessing it is all tongue in cheek action and not much I can pass judgement on.  If it is tongue in cheeks, then I won't pass judgement.
I believe it wasnt.  Its the pinnacle of comedy so I would expect it to be facetious.  Ive heard good things about the film,  I doubt it will be the best film, but Ive seen it,  so Im not sure what to expect,  Im sure it was not the pinnacle,  but ive heard goodThings about it.
I'm sure Oscar Wilde was not a genius.  He considered himself a comedian, but he did not declare himself to be a genius, but a comedian.  The rally was full of others who considered themselves to be genius.
The man wrote some great plays, but he was a bit pompous and not very popular, he was the man wrote 3 plays that became quite popular
I guess the'y call him the comedy of manners.  I guess he was earnest but not about importance.  He was a couple of comedy movies and not very serious at all.  One of them was the comedy Of Manners, I guess the movie version made by him was more earnest.  Did you ever go to theater, or have you ever seen the movie/movies version made out of it?
Yeah, I read that I saw that one too. It was performed in my high school when I was in high school. I think it was fun to see.
That's true, the dual meanings of words, like dual, death, and wallpaper, sounds too good to be true to be just words.
I am not sure, but I am sure it was not fine.  Kissing Oscar Wilde's lipstick covered tomb could result in a different tomb, the man had some weird predilections.  I mean, a lipstick covered  tomb could be the tomb of an artist, not an artist with a lipstickcovered tomb.
I don't know, but I know that people have turned the place into a shrine with messages and gifts for their friend, lots of graffiti there and a shrine, the same cemetery as Jim Morrison, where people haveturned the place in to a shrine as Jim's, and lots offfiti.
I guess he is a beloved figure and people really have respect for him.  He was willing to pay for the fine.  I guess he was a beloved figures and people want to show respect.
Hundreds, maybe thousands.  No fine for kissing on the lips but a fine forkissing someone is thousands.
Yeah, I would too.  There is a boy with a gravestone of himself lurking around out there, lurking around.  Boy, what a gravestones!  Great chat!
You too! I think I'm going to go stream Kung Fu Hustle for the evening, and then stream Kung fu hustle. Have a good day, bye!
Have a good evening, enjoy KFH!
bye! :) :) :) 
Have you heard of the movie, A New Hope?  They paid the Piper $12 M and they didn't even know he was in it?
Hi, I haven't heard of it, what is it about?
Sounds like an interesting flick, it is based on how the CIA started a cultural war to stomp out communism, sounds like an Interesting flick.
That does sound interesting. Do you ride the subway?
I do sometimes, especially when I go to a major city like NYC. Did you know there are exclusive subway lines for congressmen?
That sounds pretty convenient.  I wonder what they look like.  Did you know Elmo is the only human to testify before the US congress?  I mean, I know that he was the only non human to testimony before the congress.
I did not know that.  Congress had Elmo testifying?  lol
I have no idea, but it's pretty surprising that the first woman to be elected to congress didn't even have the right to vote. I wonder why?  I know a woman was the first to be able to vote in 1913.
It's a shame that women couldn't vote in a national election back then, but it's a Shame that women can't vote now
Yeah that is crazy, that seems like so long ago.  But, things like that are happening now, things that would not have been possible long ago are possible now.
Yea, crazy.  I didn't even know congress was around when it started!
I wonder what the congress would look like if they did a baseball game with republicans vs democrats?  That might lead to a better congress.
For some reason I figured that would be the same.  I'm not surprised Republicans are up.  They always seem to have the wins in every baseball game.  In 2016 they won moer than they have won moers in the last 100 baseball game, so I'm surprised Republicans have more wins.
Yeah, baseball is a republican sport for a reason. I read that somewhere.
Yea, I do, I never knew Churchill won a nobel prize in literature, I should check that book out
Sounds pretty cool. romantic kissing is fairly new, not even mention in Greek literature.
No.  Kissing is a kinda odd Greek literature.  Sex, sex, sex.  Seems like it would be more liberal in other literature than this.
Yeah, kissing is kind of a weird concept!  Did you know there is a contest where writers have to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel and they have to think of the worst?  I think kissing is the worst.  It is a weirdconcept.  Maybe there should be a contest for the best opening sentence for a novel.
Hmm, I don't know.  It sounds quite challenging.  I wonder what the worse opening line ever would be?  I can't see that coming out of anything coming out.
Yeah, I think I would be betting I was in on that one, I am pretty funny.
Nice chatting with you!  Have a nice one.
Do you enjoy reading? I do.
Me too, I just finished reading a book written by Winston Churchill, I never realized he won a nobel prize, I am reading a Book written by him, have you finished it?
I didn't know that, I thought he was for peace but I only recently discovered that.  I think he won a nobel for literature because he did the opposite of what we would think.  He won a Nobel for literature and did the same what we thought.
I knew it was at the time, but I wonder if he knew about it before then?  Ancient Greek books are interesting, especially those weird romances that you rarely mention kissing for instance, but they are very serious in their actions and very weird romance's, they rarely mention kissed for example
Yes I've heard that before, apparently romantic kissing is a fairly recent development, but I didn't know that.
I have no idea, but I want to find the answer because I want the book that was destroyed so I can find out.
ugh that is upsetting, I'm angry about that, it seems like such a waste, and makes me so angry that the FDA burned six tons of literature in an act of censorship, ugh, such a Waste
Yeah, and that's a lot of literature that has not been recovered. Fortunately these days if you have a digital copy of the books it's virtually impossible to destroy literature. A lot of it will remain as books it virtually impossibleTo destroy literature, but hopefully it can be recovered.
I hope so too. I wonder if they can find the "worst opening sentence" to a novel. I've heard that there's a yearly contest tat challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence.
I thought that was interesting and very difficult. I thought it was reading about boots. Some pretty bad books can be really difficult. Do you like fiction? I like reading about books but I think fiction is so difficult!
I didn't know that. What an interesting fact for a non interesting fact.
I like to go back to boots.  Nokia used to make boots before their phones.  I wonder why?
I would have expected that.  I didn't know ugg boots were invented in 1908.
I know boots are interesting but honestly I don't know, I was fascinated learning about them in a book, I believe it was surfers trying to keep their feet warm.  boots are fascinating but honestly not sure.
They are uncomfortable, they absorb a lot of water and have to be water repellent, and are very uncomfortable to use.
They are not at all like the Uggs of today.  I think that the earlier models were more efficient and a lot better than the Ugly Ugg's of today, but the earliermodels were not the trucks farmers used to walk to markets, they used a wagon or even a wagon. They didn't make little boots for turkeys, that's for sure.
That's a hilarious image, boots for turkeys. I would love to see that.
I wonder if that would be cost effective, or if turkeys sold for meat would be more cost effective when they reach their destination?
I wonder how much the phrase "pulling oneself up by their bootstraps" is used?
I am curious about that, it is mentioned in the book, is it really?
Interesting.  I wonder if it was originally meant to be?  It seems pretty much impossible, right?
Did you know Serena Williams really chewed out an umpire at the 2016 US Open tennis tournament?
I heard about that.  She had a meltdown that day?
She was accused of receiving coaching from someone and started it up.
Yes, she was penalized a point for not smashing her racket, unlike others. But she is not surprised that she was not penalized.
I am not sure I am happy with the umpire.
He called him a thief, demanded an apology and said he was not a thief.
Tennis fans were not too happy about that either and booed her conduct.
They booed at the trophy presentation ceremony too
Did they boo osaka?
Well they made a speech stating to give her credit where credit is due, they should congratulate Naomi and not boo anymore, they shouldn't boo anymore so let's congratulate her and then congratulate Naomi.
One thing I think is the situation was that the umpires were really upset because of this whole situation.
I think they acted in a professional way, they did not do anything to him.
I think there is a double standard when it comes to women.  Umpires seem very tolerant of that kind of behavior from men, but not people like Billy Jean King, women have a different double standard than men.
I read that.  He threatened to boycott Williams future matches.
Yes they did and he has to pass.
I wonder about that too.  The WTA used to have umpires but they abandoned them in the 1930s.
I think that umpire Ramos is the best one out of the lot, he is well respected and should be respected.  I think that will end soon though.
Yes, but I feel like he can make unpopular calls in the sport, so they feel like they have to look back and try to understand why they have had to make unpopular Calls before.
I know, right, I don't want to take guff from a referee.
True.  Williams was so smart he could do stuff like that.
Good talking to you, enjoy the holidays!
Good morning!  Are you a tennis fan?
I love the Williams sisters. They are amazing and take a lot of flak for it but I feel like they are amazing. Do you?
I'm sure they draw a lot of unfair criticism for being dominant players and being so good, but they are just dominant players.
True.  Serena was criticized some time ago for her meltdown, but it's worse than that.  I think she had a meltdown because of an exchange with the umpire over the sex and race of one of his players.  What a way to get into a meltdown.  Even worse, she's gotten criticism for it.
That is partially true but Serena does have a habit of losing her temper off the court, I think she puts a lot of pressure on herself and tends to lash out and say things that are not necessary.  The whole 'on court' incident was an "in court" incident so it was not an "off court" one.  I think tennis is a very serious game and it puts a whole lot of stress and pressure on the players so it is natural that they lash out when they are threatened or have to be threatened.  But, I'm not sure if it's right or not to judge someone for their habit of lose their temper on the court.
Yes, it is too late for her to get away with that act. I heard that she was in the hospital after giving birth. It was so hard to get her out. She had blood clots in her lungs and the doctors couldn't listen to her and get her to the hospital. That's why I think it's so hard when the hospital is so far away and the doctor's don't know how late to get there and if she had blood clotting in her lung.
I felt bad for her after the match, she had her big moment overshadowed by her opponent and the match.
That's very true.  I mean, even a huge tennis star like Serena Williams freaking out over a move like that brought her so much attention.  It's pretty much just what people want when they're already pretty much at the top, and then they get a huge Tennis star like Sandra Williams freaking it out over one move.
That's true, I am curious to know if people know more about the controversy. I remember when she first did her first match versus the same opponent and there was some controversy, I don't remember the name of the match but it was a 4-4 match.
That's a very good point, I think I learned that about Naomi Osaka and that's why I've heard about the incident so long ago but I don't think I've ever learned who it was until recently.
I think that we need more big time athletes in stressful situations to do something like that. For Serena's sake and for Steph Curry's, they need to learn to express themselves better. They are in tough situations and need to get over it.
I wonder what is weighing on her.
His opinion is very valid and he is a big advocate for women in sports, he is also one of the best basketball players in the league today.  I think that as a contemporary black athlete and a big Advocate for women, his opinion is one of most valid.
Speaking of Serena, did you know he also co-owns the miami dolphins?
I remember when the Dolphins were sold in 2001, they brought in a lot of celebrities to invest as part of the group. Marc antony and J-Lo brought in the team's ownership and the group brought in Marc an tony and j-lo to own the team.
I love that they have the money to invest in a sports team. Good for them. It's good for a sportsteam.
They are not very good but they have brought in some new coaches to try and start to turn them into good, like the Dolphins, so maybe they will start to get it together.
I have limited knowledge of the sports so I don't know how to compare them to anything.  I do know that the Golden State Warriors are really good lol.
Yes, the football comparison is the New England Patriots and the Golden State Warriors, both teams are dominant and constantly on the hunt for championships.
Wait, wait! There are two teams in the sport? The Miami Dolphins and Golden State Warriors.
I think that the Dolphins are a football team and the Warriors are a basketball team, but I am not sure,
I thought they were the same stuff.  They have a sibling in San Francisco.  I'm not big into basketball or football but the Pats and Tom Brady are my two.  The Pats and QB are both big into Basketball or football.
Tom Brady is probably the best player in the NFL, Steph Curry is pretty old but he is a big game, Tom Brady is the best ever!  It's been fun talking sports with you, have a great day and a biggame!
Nice talking to you!  You too!
Do you think stars like the stars really don't bother you?
No, I do not, who is it? I haven't seen the movie, what is it about?
I heard it is a movie, Lakeith Stanfield is in it, I don't like him though.
I will check it out. What do you know about congress?
I know that there are 3 subway lines exclusively for congressmen to move between the capitol and offices.
Yeah, that was an interesting fact.  I wonder why they decided to do that last year?
I think it was a recent thing.  The annual republican / democrat baseball game didn't start until 1909.
I think it would be pretty fun to watch if you could go back in time and watch all those games from the early 1900s.  You'd be able to go back and watch it all the way to the 1960s.
Did you know that the first woman was elected to congress in 1916?
Yeah I would like to see that one too! I wonder how fast they pitch it?
I would like to see the fantasy congress league too.
I did not know there was a fantasy Congress league, I can't imagine people would want to fight in that one, I wonder how they score points, I don't think I would want that, I'd want to score points.
I don't want to be in a fantasy league for my boots.  I'd rather fight over my boots!  I wonder if the points are based on the legislative success or if points are just based on legislative success.
Funny, Elmo once testified before congress.
That is pretty funny, did Elmo wear Ugg boots?
I don't remember seeing that on him or any other character, so I don't know if it ever happened.
True.  I wonder why the muppets would wear rubber boots.  Nokia used to make them and the muppet's would wear them.
Yeah, that's what I thought I saw too. I never knew that about Nokia. I guess they used to make them before they knew what they were doing.
I wonder if the made boots for turkeys.  A quarter million turkeys in 2012 walked from Norfolk to London in custom boots.  They made boots  for $12.95.
I guess people will do weird things for fun, it's the way of the world and that can happen!
I agree, but I think it sounds like the safest and easiest way to transport.  Do you like literature, or transport?
Yeah, it does.  Yeah, it sure does. Well it was nice chatting with you today, I hope you have a good day!
What kind of footwear do you like?
I like a lot of boots. What about you?
I have a few as well, they come in handy during the winter, have you heard of Uggs?
Yes, they are to keep your feet warm.  I use them when I surf occasionally.
Me too. Do you know who invented them?
I think in general surfers invented them to keep their feet warm in the ocean, but I don't know how well that work.
yeah, pulling oneself up by their bootstraps'means it!
Yes, it is based on the bootstraps and the pull oneself up by the boot straps. I think it is pretty much impossible.
Yeah, Nokia originally made boots, I wonder if they have them in the UK too?
Really? I did not know that.
No, I don't think so. I know that they used to make rubber boots though.
Yes they do, and people have a lot of interesting history in general. There was a man who was photographed by a cleaner cleaning his boots, and the man was actually a cleaner Cleaner cleaning his Boots
Yes, you are correct. Do you like literature, do you know much about literature?
I do! Literature is a forgotten form of art, but once upon a time it was an olympic event and a forgotten forms of art.
Yeah, that is really cool.  I like music painting and sculpture better.
I like contests for the worst possible opening sentence to a book, there is an annual contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possibly opening sentence for a book.
I wonder who that is?  Do you like to read?  In the 1930's the FDA burned six tons of books in an act of US censorship.
That is awful. I heard romantic kissing was a development in reading has experienced a lot of changes.
Yeah, I think it was only very rarely mentioned in the ancient Greek literature, and definitely rarely mentioned now.
Winston Churchill once won a Nobel Peace Prize for literature but said the state of literature has not improved.
Go figure.  That guy was talented!  It was nice chatting with you.
I enjoy reading Shakespeare, a lot of people do, do you?
I do. The actress Olivia Wilde changed her name to the Irish poet and playwright as a nice tribute to the old Irish poet.
Nice tribute! Were you aware that Shakespeare invented many of the phrases we use today, laughing stock, luck, good riddance, good luck, and good riddingance, and the devil incarnate? I wonder if they were aware that shakespeare invented the phrases "good luck" and "laughing stock".
I did not know that but Shakespeare has a large body of work, I read all of his plays, it's difficult at times to find the language in his language and English in his plays. He's got some clever puns and hidden jokes in all his plays that get lost in the large body. You can find hidden jokes everywhere in Shakespeare's plays.
That is hard when starting but if caught in the rhythm pretty quickly you will get caught up. Did you know he was alive at the same time as Pocahontas?
I never knew that either! It's funny that he went to Hamlet to play Yorick and had no idea he would be in it. Alas, poor Pocahontas had to play him, and the idea of having the skull of a hamlet in her skull when she was 10 is funny.
Hamlet is my favorite Shakespeare work.  I revisited it in college and loved it.  It was so simple and so simple compared to other plays that I was surprised to learn they had invented so many names for it. I liked Miranda, Jessica, Jessica's, Olivia, etc.  Hamlet is also my favorite work that I revisit when I am revisited.  Did you know that Miranda was invented by three people?  Olivia, Jessica and Miranda?
I never thought about that before, but I have read his works and presume that we do. I think about the man Shakespeare and think how he thought. I also read that he kept records for commoners so that they would not have to keep records forever. Unlike our lives now where we read his Works and presume to one day have the same records for us.
Good question.  I am interested in learning more about him.  He wrote comedies too.  Do you enjoy comedies or drama with Shakespeare?  I know that I enjoy comedie more than I do drama.
I do like comedy. Harold and Kumar was funny, I learned that some of the movies are referred to as bromantic comedies.  I dont know if that is a comedy though.  Some movies are refer to as that.  Harold andumar was funny and I like that.
I love you man a lot, I liked the step brothers and I also like lots of "I Love You Man's" Demetri Martin stand-up. Did you know that he was accepted into Harvard Law but did not go?
Demetri Martin is a funny guy, I like him, dropping out of school to pursue comedy instead of going to law school. Ryan Stiles is a really funny guy as well, dropping from law school a few years ago, he did the Drew Carly show, that's a new thing for him, I think, and I think he's really funny, I haven't seen him in anything else since.
I can't remember the name. He was tall. I love Bill Murray, tall and a slim man. I am a fan of his.
I do like Bill Murray, I watched Kung Fu Hustle with him and the man was a different man.  I like dogs and cats sleeping, have you ever watched Kung fu hustle with your dogs and Cats?
He is amazing! I am a huge fan of Kung Fu Hustle, it is great! I disagree with you but it is good and I am not a huge user of KungFu Hustle.
It's not for the whole mind.  There are several levels to comedy.  Pure visual, like slapstick, is funny but it is not strictly words.  It's like Buster Keton and the Three Stooges.  Not funny at all, but funny in a slapstick way.  But, comedy is about pure visual, in my mind.
True, but it is also very slapstick heavy.  I never realized that 3rd rock from the sun won the Golden Globe for best comedy series in 1997, which is surprising.  It was very visual, slapstickheavy, and very true.  3rd Rock from the Sun was a series of three visual comedy movies that was very slapster heavy. I didn't even know Kung Fu Hustle was a comedy, I think I realized that when 3rdRock from the SUN won the golden globe...
That's great.  I can see 3rd Rock beating Seinfeld, Friends and Frasier.  It was the height of the network TV comedy network's in 1997.  That was the year when many of the new channels were airing new shows and new things were available, with things like the internet and TV channels.  But, I think it was great for 3rd rock beating Segment and Friends at the height.
I enjoy it, I liked Seinfeld, Friends, and I still enjoy it. I think Seinfeld will always hold up, though.
I agree, it is showing in reruns right now.  Channel surfing and I see Friends, Seinfeld, and Frasier live on 3rd rock from the rock.  I have to declare that I am not a genius, and declare myself a genius!
I agree with you, I think it is a great quote, it quoted Oscar Wilde.
Are you a fan of Bill Shakespeare?
Hi. Yes I like Shakespeare. He was really talented, he was born a long time ago. Crazy to think he was only born in 50BC, crazy he was already born a LONG time ago!
He was alive at the time of Queen Elizabeth II, he managed to write all of that during the time he was alive. I dont think he got much sleep, but he sure managed to writing while he was there.
Yeah, I'm not sure. I heard he was a bard of Avon, but not famous. He was called England's national poet.
I've never heard that name before but I've read his stuff and I know the nickname is a great experience to have a nickname like that, "The Bard of Avon" I wonder if he has ever performed as a Bard? I would like to read his work if I could.
I agree it is crazy that it is performed with a period accurate accent!  I wonder if the rhymes will work with a more period accurate accents.
I bet the language has changed since then, the language can feel impenetrable to us to this day.
I agree.  It's kind of like reading Shakespeare, when I was a kid.  He was a genius and he would make grammatical errors in order to heighten attention as a kid, which is crazy that you would do that.  I wonder why?
He had a genius understanding of language, sound and meaning. He changed language singlehandedly with the words he created. I think he changed language with the many words he creation.
Apparently he did, he made so many inventions for the English language and he died at age 76, he should have lived longer with all the inventions he had made and he only died at ages 76, apparently he would have been the last one to have lived in the English Language,
He had a pretty long life, but I guess he wasn't fortunate to have had problems with sanitation in those days, lots of disease, lots to think about. He probably died much younger than that, but he had problems, and he probably had problems in his days, with lots of Disease. I guess that's why he died much earlier than he did.
I agree with you.  On a happier note, do you watch any comedies?  I know that I include black comedies in this but that might not include black comedy.  Do you?
I do, including black comedies. Do you like bromances?
I like comedy.  I like the school stuff like Monty Python haha.  It's crazy that Graham Chapman was originally going to pursue medical doctor rather than comedy. He would have been a doctor if he hadn't have had to pursue comedy.
Graham was a bright one!  He was funny and very funny, but he did have a drinking problem, I miss him.
Oh wow I didn't know that about his drinking.  A show he was on a lot was Comedy Central and it started out so well, they didn't cancel the shows when they started.  They canceled over 100 since 1989.  It doesn't surprise me that a TV station would have to cancel the Shows that are canceled.
They canceled South Park? Thank God they did, I get addicted to that show every fall. I am addicted.
Yep I would too. Do you ever watch that 70s Show by the way? I really like Ryan Reynolds and I also like the movie Green Lantern, did you ever see that? Apparently it is going to star Jack Black and it is also going to be the next movie to star Ryan Reynolds, I wonder if I'll watch it
Yeah, Jack Black is a natural comedian.  The Green Lantern is ok but I have never seen it.  Anyway, great chat!
You were an excellent chat partner.  Make sure to check out work from Oscar Wilde.  He had some wonderful plays.
Yes, in earnest, he was all about the importance of the importance to be a good night.
Interesting. His great-grandson is a computer programmer these days. One of my relatives is actually a computer engineer.
Hi, how are you?
Good, how are you?  Did you know Tom Hanks is the highest total grossing box-office draw as an actor in the us?
I did know that! He deserves it! He was America's Sweetheart.
Hah yes very true.  Did you know that the guy literally refuses to play the roles of bad guys?
I wonder if he ever got any other gigs besides his sitcom "boosum buddies" gigs
Haha I didn't. I did see him in Forrest Gump and Apollo 13!
Yeah those were both great movies.  I loved cast of them.  It had a 10 year run.
That movie Saving Mr Banks was really good. Have you seen it?
I have not seen it. What is it about?
I don't know, it was a movie apparently, Tom Hanks played Walt Disney in it, and Tom Hanking played Walt disney
I saw the trailer for it and remember it, but not the actual movie.  It's with Sully, but I didn't see it myself.  I've seen a trailer though, and it's OK.
Sully is kind of boring in my opinion. One cool thing about Tom Hanks is that he ends his emails with a pun.
That is so fun, I wonder if that was a thing he did on purpose or if it was just done on purpose. He insinuated that he was offended by "Sully" and he did not mean to sully it.
haha I was too, but I guess Tom Hanks personally refunded money for everyone, kind of like what happened in real life, I guess tom hanks personally refunds money, he seems like a nice guy,
Nice, but proably he was too immature to know how to use the money, and that is immature if you ask me, but nice!
haha nope I wouldn't have either, I would have never left haha do you like Disney movies at all? I think disney movies are my favorite, what is your favorite?
I love Disney. Aladin is my favorite. What is your favorite?
ya I like that one, I guess disney thought about shutting down after the failure of sleeping beauty, the mermaid one, and the failure the failure Of Sleeping Beauty
I loved the Little Mermaid! My daughter was 5 and we watch it all the time when I was little, she loved it.  I think there are so many movies kids would like, but not sure if they will watch.  It is a Mermaid.
Did you know the Disney movie Treasure Planet had many songs from the songs that were in the Disney Movie Treasure Planet?
I have not, but I will have to check it out. Nice chatting with you!
Do you like Chadwick Boseman? He is the new host on SNL.
I love Kenan Thompson. He was in the black jeopardy too.
Black Panther has done really well at the global box office. It crossed the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office and has never placed below that.
Yes, Dorothy Steel, made her big film acting debut as merchant tribal elder.
I did not know that. Did you know Black Panther is the richest superhero?
Wow, that is so cool the elderly merchant in Busan, Sophia who appeared in Black Panther was performed by Alexis Rhee, wow!
Tony Stark is worth $8.5 billion and Bruce Wayne is worth over $80 billion.
Wow, I can't afford that much. Chadwick Boseman was accepted into the prestigious summer theater program at Oxford University.
Too bad he couldn't afford it. The symbols and written script featured in black panther are based on an actual script called nsibdi.
Wow, I did not know that.  Tom Hanks only had to pay 10 percentage points which earned him 700 million dollars.  He also paid for Forrest Gump.  $75 million dollars and only paid for forrest gump.
I did not know that.  I did know that Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star.
LOL.  Tom Hanks was originally cast to play Mario in the super mario bros but he didn't want to.  I wonder why?  Tom hanks was also cast to do super marion bros.  lol
He refuses to play bad guy roles in films, he says he doesn't want to play the bad guy.
I didn't know that.  Tom Hanks modeled forrest gump's voice directly from the actor who played him.  I wonder if the real voice was the one that he did or the one he did not get?  Tom hanks modeled Forrest gump voice directly for the actor.
Tom Hanks was the first actor to play Walt Disney in a mainstream film, saving Mr. Banks' name. I wonder what it was about?
That's cool. Alfonso Cuaron's astounding movie "Children of Men" lost 8 million dollars at the box office.
I saw that,  I liked it too.  Silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day 1991 and had a box office of over $270 million.  It must have been a Valentine's Day.  lol
Mortal Kombat 2 is the only game to surpass Hollywood box office sales.
I didn't know that.  I saw treasure planet was one of the most expensive box office flops of All time.  It was the second most expensive.  Treasure Planet was the first one.
I know, those are horrendous losses' did you know that the Lord of The Rings trilogy made over $8.5B!
Did you know the movie Trojan Wars was a major flop?
Hi, how are you?
I'm great! Have you heard of Chadwick Boseman?
I loved him in Black Panther. Have you heard of him?
I have he was in the Black Jeopardy skit that was on SNL, he showed up in the black jeopardy skit and that was hilarious
I don't think I have seen that, I did watch SNL a lot.
I have watched Black Jeopardy on YouTube. Did you know that the character Black Panther is supposed to have half a trillion in wealth?
I wonder if that was like Sean Conery's jeopardy skit?
Yes, it was so funny. He kept mispronouncing the categories and saying "pen is mightier than a political party."  I wonder if he was named after the Black Panther character that is named after a politicalParty.
No I didn't know that either. Black panther is actually the richest super hero worth $500,000,000. Do you know who the richest superhero was?
Ch Chadwick Boseman needed financial help when he was young. We need more like him in a prosperous country.
I read that he took acting classes to help get famous pay.
Yeah, Denzel paid for him to study at Oxford for a summer.
That is nice of him. I hear there is a different type of altruism in pop culture but I think there is still bad stuff going on.
Denzel is a fun bad guy. I think he is secretly a really fun bad guys. Tom Hanks refuses to play bad guys either. He wanted to be like Denzel and do what Denzel does.
He is a legit good person.  I don't know why he doesn't want to be in the movies.
I like his films geneally, I think he has a good range in the comedy and drama. He ends his emails with a pun (pun is a cheesy way of saying it) so it is totally a dad move. It's a very good range.
I think he can do both, he was in the films "Castaway" and "Runaways" I like those films, have you seen those films?
He and Hanks are the most bankable star of the new Star Wars.  Disney should put them both in Star Wars since their films have generated $8.5 billion worldwide.  Hanks is the second most bankABLE star, after himself.
I haven't seen Star Wars since they released the new Jedi on Netflix. I am excited to watch it, will you?
I know a little about the films, but dunno too much about them.  It is difficult to keep track of things with all of the films.
That's the perfect age I'm at. Well, nice chatting with you.
Do you like Black Panther?
No, I have not. Have you seen it?
I have and I enjoyed it. I thought it was a good addition to the Marvel Universe.
Did you know Black Panther is the richest superhero?
I did read that. I thought it was Tony Stark, alas. I would have thought it would be him.
Tony Stark is the estimated $500 billion, but is Tony Stark worth $500 Billion?
I do not! What do you mean?
It is over 8.62 billion and Bruce Wayne is getting 8.53 billion.
I believe it. I have never seen it.
I'm sure they're doing better than 100 billion but they still need to make it work haha bruce Wayne's estimation of 80 billion to be able to makeIt work haha Bruce Wayne was right
Gotta have that cold bat cave, right?  You know Tom Hanks would have made a good Batman.  He's gotta have a cold cold bat Cave.
I think he would make a good batman, he would be the voice. I do not think he could make aGood Batman, what are your thoughts on that?
It scares me that Tom Hanks would go for a run into the dark ally of the loving arms of the dark and that he would run into all of the scares.  I like Tom HANK.  He is a great actor.
Hahahh I love that!  Do you like how he refuses to play bad guy roles in films?  Why?  I like that he doesn't play bad guys roles.
He is a great guy. He makes such good movies. He has made so many.
He makes so much he is the highest all-time box office star
Yes!  Weird that it took time for him to be in a mainstream film, but he played Disney's first "mainstream" film.  His role in saving Mr Banks was the first mainstream film he was in.
Yes, I think he played Walt Disney!
That's what I thought too, but I don't know. Tom Hanks has never played in a movie before so maybe he should have played it.
True! Do you know how he ends his emails?
No, how is it?
I think it's funny puns.  Have a nice day.
Hi!  Are you a huge fan of movies?  Black Panther is one of my favorites.
I have seen it, it was great. I hope to see the sequel.
Yes, it would be cool! I heard that it broke over 8 billion dollars at the box office and became a bona fide global sensation!
I love all the super hero movies but Black Panther is my favorite. Dorothy Steel made her debut in the film and I love her. Do you like super hero Movies but Black panther is my least favorite.
I had no idea! That's a pretty neat thing to have on your bucket list. Black Panther is on my bucket list for sure. I've heard that it's estimated that it will be worth over $500 billion at the box office and Bruce Wayne is only 55 yrs. older than Black Panther so it will last longer than that. It's a neat thing that he estimated $500 Billion to be the value of Black Panther.
That's impressive.  Are you a Tom Hanks fan?
I am, he cracks me up! I like how he refuses to play bad guys in any movies he chooses to. He doesn't want to play them in any more movies he's chosen to.
Yeah I think that is big for him, he has done some great movies, The Green Mile is one of my most favorite so far, and Big, both are great movies
I loved Mr. Banks and that was a really recent film I saw, he has done so many great movies, I think the first actor to play Walt Disney in a mainstream film, and that is true, he is the first and only actor to do so, he was the first to play walt disney
I saw that movie, I liked how Walt Disney portrayed him in that movie.
It is a really nice feel good movie. It has a historical feel and it has Tom Hanks as a star in the film. It's a really good film. I think it has a worldwide box office earnings of over $8.5 billion.
He is.  Turner and Booch were both great high grossing movies.
Yeah, that's a good point. I saw him in the movie Trojan Wars a long time ago. The movie Trojan wars only grossed 1.5 billion when it hit. That's not a good hit.
It is hard to predict what will hit. I heard Tom Hanks was originally going to do a Super Mario movie, and that was going to be the best movie of his career. The cast of the Mario movie was all good but it was not a hit.
I agree with you, that would not have been funny.  So many hits and flops.  The Disney movie Treasure Planet was the most expensive flop of all times.  I wonder if the Disney movie treasure planet will ever be a hit?
My wife loves Disney movies and makes me watch them, but I don't remember Treasure Planet.
I heard the first one, Beauty and the Beast, was a huge failure, they closed down the animation portion and did not reopen the animation part, they loved Beauty and The Beast a lot huh?
My wife's favorite Disney movie is Beauty and The Beast but my favorite Disney Movie of all mine is Lion King.
Yeah, mine is Beauty and the Beast. I like it, but the force is not with me in the house, that is for sure, did you watch Apollo 13? I saw it the year I got Tom Hanks, did it force me to watch Apollo 11
Tom Hanks is a huge fan of Stephen King's books, the Green Mile was a book that the movie is based on, and the Green Mountain of course, but Tom Hanks also is a fan of King's novels as well.
Yeah, Stephen King's scary novels are super weird.  Tom Hanks is really cool.  I liked that movie!  It made me think of something super weird!  That movie was really cool!  Anyway, thanks for chatting!  I think I'm gonna go do some more Stephen King scary novels one day, but it was fun chatting with you!
Sounds good. Nice chatting with you!
Same to you. I'll see you around.
Hi, do you like spiderman?
I do, he is one of my favorite superheros! Do you like him?
Spider-man can be confused with Superman, but spider-man has a hyphen because stan lee did, I guess I wrote it wrong,
Stan Lee was an amazing man. He really is. He was pretty interesting. In 1998, Marvel offered the cinematic rights to his characters to Sony for a mere $25 million, but they kept it for themselves. In 2005, Marvel offers the cinematicrights to his Characters to Sony and they've paid $500 million!
Yeah and Sony rejected, they could have bought everything except for spider-man.
That is crazy, I wonder how much of a deal that was?
Stan lee's wife was the voice of the madame web in the spider-man series, not the voice for the spider.
Spider-man was the first and only production in Broadway's musical "Turn on your heel" which is also the most expensive production in broadway's history. I wonder how dark and/or dark it got.
I did not. I wonder how good it was? Was it good? Too bad about the music. Maybe because of injuries on set? They don't even have injury insurance anymore. They had to shut down because of the injuries.
Yeah the music and lyrics were written by Bono, right?
Yeah that was it.  I heard that there was a comic series about fixing their collateral damage.  Superheroes can do a lot of damage in this universe and have heard there was one comic series  about that.
That's pretty cool. There's a superhero called "normalman" who is a superhero
Yes, I did. Do you know why he is called that?
Basically he is the only person without superpowers in a planet full of superheroes, he is a person without superheroes.
Wow, I was nervous to see whatis needed to register them in real life, I wonder if they registered superheroes? I wonder whatis needs to register superheroes.
That's alot.  I wonder how many are really?
I know right, kids are always asking me about it. Have you heard about the Garfield book series spinoff? It's called Pet Force. The Garfield bookseries spinoff and the gang are superheros.
No, I haven't, but it sounds pretty funny, I'll have to check it out.
Me too!  I am in the mood to watch a Marvel show on Netflix right now, have you seen it?
You too!  Thanks!
It would be fun! Thanks!
Music is very romantic and unite people, it create romances and seal them, music is very Romantic and unite.
It is music, jazz is the genre that does it, do you like jazz?
Jazz. Do you like it?
Jazz is great! There are so many fans out there, I always suspected that even Clint Eastwood, a lifelong jazz enthusiast, would be one of them. I can see why.
Yeah I know he does play the piano in his films, and he even does jazz songs in some of his films.
Yes, Clint is great as a singer/actor/singer. On a related note, I am astonished that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra. I can't even imagine jazz as popular in another part of the world.
Pakistan has an orchestra?  Interesting fact about the orchestra,  all the trumpeters grew goatees.
I do know that Jazz trumpeters grew goatees because it provide comfort when playing.  I guess it helps with the hair.  Steven Spielberg used to play clarinet.  He was the only clarinet player who did not have hair.
I didnt know that, that is a cool fact did you watch the movie Tron? it was a very scary soundtrack did you ever watch theMovie Tron, that was a scary soundtrack
No, I haven't seen the movie Tron, what's it about?
No, I never saw that either.  Do you pay attention to the soundtrack of any band that plays in it?  Daft Punk is a band that's plays in the soundtrack.
Well Eminem is one of the biggest musical influences, he has a better vocal range than Freddie Mercury, and Sheeran, I think Eminem has a much better vocal ranges than Freddie mercury.
I don't know him, but I do know that he recorded the song "Fire" for the hobbit movie in barely a day, he was so good at doing the voice of the hobbits, he recorded it for the Hobbit movie in literally a day.
I would love to do soundtracks of those, I wonder if he wrote the song.  Bieber would be a strange choice for a singer for one of those soundtracks.  He is so different from bieber.  I would have thought he would have given up on that, he would not fit his album, I think.  But, I would think he would of thought that he could have written it.  It gave him a different voice and he could fit in.
That is really weird, but I think they were friends and they owed Bieber a favor.
He got off to a rough start in his career. He couch surfed for a while, slept outside Buckingham Palace and slept outside Buckley's Palace. He had to go underground for a few years before he finished his music. It was a rough way to start a career.
Wow, that is tough! I bet he sang on buses and public transportation. People didnt know how to take him seriously then. I bet they would fight a lot, top of the way, because he was one of the big names and artists but people didnt like him.
I know he has tons of cash!  There is a programming language that you can learn and most of the programs are written in musical composition.  What kind of compositions do you like?  I like the way programs arewritten in musical compositions.
Yeah he is a great artist, and one of his biggest influences was eminem, I guess he wouldnt know that, he is another great artist.
Well, I enjoyed chatting with you!
Same here, I will listen to some of Sheeran's songs lol, have a nice day!
Are you a fan of superheros?
I don't know much about them but I do like them alot.
Ive seen all of them,  my favorite is Deadpool,  I dont know if I am good at distinguishing between marvel and dc though,  Hulk is my favorite.  Ive never seen the Hulk.
Hulk is one of the 300 registered superheroes in the US.
Wow, that is a lot! I heard there was a comic about fixing the collateral damage caused by the superheros, I bet it was funny I've never heard of it.
lol  I was just thinking about the Normalman superhero, what is that?  I like the normalman superhero
Is that about power or lack of a power?
I don't know.  But I do know that this is a planet of superheroes.
Interesting! I wonder if Cap'n Crunch has rivals?
I never knew that. I would love to be a pet force and watch Garfield cat and the gang. I also like Garfield cat.
Ahhh yes!  I loved those cartoons.  Garfield is a great name, nermal, nerMAL!  Odie, odie, Odie!
Cute. I wonder why Stan Lee needed that hyphen in spider-man? There was confusion as to why he needed thathyphen.
Did you know that a marvel superhero with hearing aids was created because a boy believed superheros dont wear them?  The boy believed Superheros don't wear them.
Awww,I love that!  That is so great for the kids.
Yes, it will be a great one for sure, it'll be about how the world used to be.
Yes I agree. Stan Lee's wife Joan was the voice of madame web in the Spider-Man series.
Neat! Marvel even argued in court that mutants arent people and they should pay lower rates on toys, they are.
I'm surprised that there are toys that don't have them in them. Walt Disney World acquired Marvel Entertainment in 2012, I think.  Disney World bought them when Walt Disney world acquired Marvel entertainment.
I didnt know Disney acquired them, thats pretty neat, I think they own all of them, I didn't know Disney was doing that.
Disney and universal go back to 1853.  Crazy. lol  Anyway, great chat.  Disney and Universal go back and forth like that.
You too!  Have a great day!
Are you a spider-man fan?
Hello, I am not really big into superheroes.  They made a spider-man musical which is pretty cool, but it was the most expensive Broadway show.  It's probably because it was a musical.
That is crazy!  I heard it was made for about $25 million, that seems really high but I think it made over $200 million, thats too high!
I wonder how expensive spider webs are. Marvel sold Spider-man to Sony in 1998. They had offered to sell all their characters. Marvel sales were so good they offered to sold Spider‑Man to Sony, but Sony declined.
I was surprised when I learned that. I always believed that movie audiences didn't care for him and believed that's true. But I just learned that it's not true.
There are a ton of superhero movies now, it's hard to believe that Marvel started out with a ton.  Back in the 1960s and 70s there weren't a ton, there were only a few superhero movies.
I know, crazy!  I can't believe that Marvel is only one of the over 300 registered superheroes in the United States.  There are over 300 of them in the US.  I wonder how many registered superheroes there are in the U.S.
Probably a lot more than that,  Iron Man,  Thor,  Deadpool,  Hulk,  Wolverine,  etc...
The funniest superhero I heard of, is the one who is a normalman, that is the only person without superpowers on a planet full of superheroes, normalman.
That is pretty funny, Disney owns Marvel and that is a neat collaboration, they should have a neat collaborated together.
Marvel created a superhero who is a superhero because he has hearing aids. This helps the boy feel more comfortable in the community. It is great for a little boy feel like a superhero.
I heard that!  I think it is called Blue Ear.  That is so cool!
A little boy told his mom superheroes dont wear hearing aids so marvel created a new one, but he told his Mom superheroes dont worn hearing aids and now Marvel created one.
I would have loved to see that, he would have been 5 years old by now.
I think its bizarre that disney cannot show big marvel characters in theme parks.
Yeah that is in agreement with Universal.
Yes they signed something like that back in 1998, something like they signed it in 1998
I guess you can see the Avengers at Disney World.
I wonder if they have mutants or other people in the court of the court?
Not sure if that was a good or bad idea. I think that they should just keep the toys the sell at the cheaper rate. Anyway, thanks for chatting!
Good afternoon!  Do you like the Marvel characters?  Spiderman was one of the first created by Stan Lee, and he is one of my favorite Marvel characters.
I love him! Stan lee was so creative an amazing. the Marvel company has done such a great work. superhero movies are the best, I love them.
Awesome!  Spiderman first appeared in the anthology comic book amazing fantasy number one, and it was from the comic book Amazing Fantasy Number One.
Wow, I didnt know that, I wonder why they didnt use him in the comics, isnt it incredible that he was first in them, Stan Lee wrote all of them, is it incredible how far comics have come since then!
That is incredible.  The wife of Stan Lee was the voice of Madame web in the spiderman series, and the voice in the first spidermanSeries
That's cool! Speaking of Spiderman, apparently Sony bought the rights to Spiderman and rejected the offer to buy it for $25 mill. They wanted Spiderman for $15 mill. I wonder if they regret that now.
I bet Sony wished they would have, I like Spiderman and many other characters, I bet Sony wish they could buy the rest.
I know, it feels like it was just yesterday that they took him back in 1939, it seems like it's been around for a while now. I wonder what he's worth now, and I wonder how much they were worth back then.
No doubt.  The Broadway musical Spiderman was the most expensive production in Broadway history and at one turn was so dark it was the first production to turn out to be dark.  That was in 2014.
Interesting. I think people can relate to that. Did you know there are over 300 registered superheroes in the US? And not many of them are superhero in real life.
I didn't know that!  I heard about a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes.  LOL  I wonder if it is a comic or a comic book?
I have heard of it lol, there is a super hero named "Normalman" who is just a person without super powers, I can relate haha, he's just a normalman, the only person who doesn't have any superpowers, I could relate haha
I can relate, I wonder if there is a comic book about Garfield and the gang?
I think it is called, "Pet Force"  I have never heard of it.  I loved Garfield.
It's surprising to hear that the superhero fiction genre has been around since the 1960's.
The evolution and growth from Marvel from Atlas comics in the 1930s to Marvel finally branding to Marvel and then Marvel finally branding it as Marvel. inspiring, inspiring, and awesome to see the evolution. I hope you like comics and its evolution and Growth.
I like the Marvel brand too.  There is a character owned by them named Access that is actually named Access, it's the only character owned under the Marvel name.
That's sweet.  I like that they created a super hero for a 3 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing his hearing aids.  Melt my heart!  He created a superhero for a little guy who was comfortable and uncomfortable wearinghis hearing aids!
I did not, that is so cute!  Blue Ear, Blue Ear!  superheroes are really good for him.  It was great chatting with you today I hope you have a good one.
Awww!  I dont even wear hearing aids, so I dont know that name.  I would love it if I did.  A little boy told his mom superheroes were like that.  It was fun chatting with you as well, and send light and love to you too!  Take care!  Thanks for sending me your love.
Good day bye!  Have a good day!
Have you heard of the electronic music group the thievery corporation? theyre starting to blow up apparently.
No, but I know they did a big weeding in Cheve chase, and in my head they devoloped a greatdoundtrack
I wonder if it will be famous in the near future. What kind of music do you like to listen to? Jazz or any other famous ones?
Yeah I do, the Pakistan jazz orchestra is a talented group. Jazz music is a very talented group, they have done very well.
I like jazz music too, I listen to it sometimes. Did you know Clint Eastwood movies have jazz music in them? Apparently he wrote the scores for many of them.
I think he is a talented musician, and a great actor, and he is also a talented actor.
Yes. I wonder how he would have performed if he had performed in the woman's house in Harlem, which is like a jazz concert every weekend at her apartment? She puts on a jazzconcert every weekend in the Woman's House.
I bet her neighbors do too, that's amazing.
As long as the conditions are met correctly, it was ok.  If it's not right, it's too late LOL.  I can't go to sleep until I make a jazz melody in my programming language.  A programmer would never realize it is too late when all the conditions aren't met, and the programmer will be too late lol.
That is amazing.  I think jazz inspires many people to do things they would never have done otherwise, especially as a programmer, but yeah I think that jazz inspires us all to do so many things.
Jazz is a great thing, people should really learn the trumpet, and grow a goatee, it helps make you more comfortable when playing apparently, some people are not comfortable when play it so that would make it more comfortable, I think I might try to learn the trumpets,
Ive always wondered if they do that on purpose, Ive always wonder why we have goatees, I mean it is nice but a bit rediculous, why goatee?
I agree.  My favorite soundtrack is the Jaws theme,  the movie itself.  What is your favorite soundtrack?
I like the soundtrack from Batman Begins, but I also like the Soundtrack from Jaws. The whole soundtrack from JAWS creeps me out.
I know, it's funny, apparently Steven Spielberg plays the clarinet in the soundtrack for Jaws, apparently Steve Spielberg playsthe clarinet lol, I never saw the soundtrack to Jaws but I do like the soundtrack
That's funny, that movie was Spielberg, I guess he had his talents! I wonder if it was a claninet or a clarinet, that man is a funny one.
I really like the movie O Brother Where Art Thou? it has a great soundtrack that was certified 8 times platinum, that is a great movie
I havent seen that movie yet, but I know that the soundtrack to that movie was also certified Platinum 8 times, that must be great if it was also Certification 8 times
Yeah the soundtrack is very good. I think I mentioned the soundtrack to Batman Begins before, but I don't think I have seen it. I did see that there is a genus of bat, interesting name for the genus of Batman, I wonder which bat that is?
I never paid attention to that. But I think I will look it up. I like her music as well. Sheeran is a talented artist.
I do like his music, but I've not listened to much of his music. Apparently Eminem was a big influence on him.
Hi. How are you? Did you know that Jazz originated in New Orleans in the late 19th century?
It's not surprising to me that it developed from roots in blues and ragtime music.
It really is.  It is a major form of music
In the end, a smoother sound was introduced.  It was calmer and much calmer.
I prefer that to the "cool jazz" sound.
I love the old sheeran music.  I'm surprised he only wrote for the 1930s.  That sound is what I love.  He wrote for all the right sound I'm sure.
I am familiar with him, I think he was born in 1986, I was young when he was really young too
Yes, he is a singer, guitarist, songwriter, songwriting, record producer and actor.  That is quite the workload for a singer/songwriter/record producer.
He really has varied talents, but so do other people! Steven Spielberg actually plays the clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack.
That's impressive! Just like Phil Collins recording versions of the Tarzan soundtrack in Italian, German, Spanish and French, along with Phil Collins Recording versions of The Tarzan Soundtrack in Italian!
I barely mastered English so it's no wonder. Speaking of music, did you know that a harlem woman, a harlequin, hosted jazz concerts every Sunday for free.
Wow that sounds fun!  I wonder if she is big in the US or just here for the most part for the US.
I'm not sure, but some of the elite performers do stop by.  Jazz musician are sometimes considered a big name, even if they're just jazz musician's.
Jazz musician's can grow goatees as well. Jazz trumpeters can use it for comfort while playing.
That is weird.  I wonder why?
It's probably because when an instrument hits you in the mouth it changes the experience, the whole experience.
It might be.  There is a Pakistani jazz orchestra.  Strange.
Apparently they're topping the charts right now!
Yes, and the soundtrack for "O Brother, Where art thou? smashed the charts. It is 8 times platinum.
That is impressive!  I have never heard of the soundtrack.
I bet it is. I haven't either.
I didn't know that.  I wonder why they did it?
Good chat!  Thanks!
I find the universe to be utterly fascinating. How about you?
I am eager to know more as the universe covers many secrets.
I know. There are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection like on Earth. It's interesting to know that species that are weaker in other aspects of the universe die out in favor of stronger ones. We are weaker on earth.
Universal Darwinism refers to the theory of Darwinism, but there are a variety of approaches that extend the theory to the original domain of biological evolution on earth, too.
There's a lot of theories out there about the universe, a lot that just don't apply to theair that we know about.  Some of the theories are hard to wrap your head around.  I thought that maybe the universe is one giant hologram.  But then, maybe that is just a thought.  It might just apply to one giant Hologram?
Hologram is an image formed by a photographic recording that is typically seen through a lens or a light field.  It is animage formed by the lens of a camera or a photographic Recording.
In any case, there is an unbelievable theory that there is only one electron in the entire universe and there is no remotely possible way that could be the case.  That is, there must be an electron in there somewhere.  It is like there is one electron that is in the whole entire universe.
I don't know the details, that is interesting though.
 atoms are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons, and we theorize that it is the building blocks of our universe.  We also think that the atoms are also made of proton, neutrino, and electron.
If an electron is moving backwards in time, it would be known as a positron. It would have it's anti-matter counterpart if an electron has a positril as its anti- Matter counterpart.
Whoa! That is interesting. That is very surprising, and a shocking fact! Another shocking fact is that there is a star in the universe that is cold enough to be touched by the human hand! The sun is so hot that there are stars that are cold enough that they can be touched.
Nice. Do you like superhero's?
I do, but I don't have a favorite. What about you?
I like superheroes and some of the talented actors, how about you?
 superhero movies now feature very talented actors, are you aware that there are over 300 registered superheroes in the United States, and superhero movies Now feature very Talentful actors, there are more than 300 registered superhero's in the united States
That is crazy! I can't believe it. Batman, Spiderman, Batman, I'm sure there is a hero for every hero, but I wonder how many have powers and what their names are, what their outfits, costumes, etc.  It seems like hollywood has its way with that
It is, I think Jessica Jones alias book, Storm and Psylocke are two of the most successful superheroes, they are also the names of movie franchises. Jessica Jones's alias book has been called a superheroine, the Netflix show is about her and she is one of the successful superheroes.
I like that people are mindful of people like that.
Superheroes are so complex and often conflicted characters. As a fan of superheroes, I like characters like Superman, Psylocke and Jessica Jones. A lot of the good comic series have been about fixing the collateral damage, fixing the damage. A good example is "The Fault in Our Stars" comic series which is about fixing collateral damage.
Superman is a fictional superhero, right?
I am not a big fan but I like him.
Good morning! The universe a crazy thing to think about. Did you know that the spatial size of the entire universe is only 1/16th the spatial Size of the sun?
That blows my mind!  I know it is tiny in comparison to us, but still.
Yes.  The earliest scientific models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers.  They were ahead of their time, I believe.  Ancient greek and Indian Philosophers were so ahead of the time.
Wow, I didn't know that. I also didn't known there was a theory that there's only one electron in the universe. that sounds kind of wild.
That's a bit off the deep end.  I can't fathom that.  There is a region of space that may be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe.  Maybe it's the region ofspace that is pulling galaxies away from us?
I literally can't even fathom that, I can't head that much in my head or even f understand how the universe is possible, literally
Good for you!  There is an odd theory that the universe is one giant super hologram!  That is a good one.
That's the one I was talking about recently. The theory that Elon Musk has been talking about lately. He believes that we are just living in some sort of simulation.
I've actually heard that theory.  I know that some stars in our universe are so cold they can't be touched by human hand.  Did you know that?
Wow, touching a star would be an experience.  I would like that experience!
I agree. I love how the universe evolves through natural selection like species on earth, I wonder if the universe evolving through natural Selection like species have done on earth?
That's what I was thinking!  I wonder if it doesnt, if it just doesnt need any intervention, like some species do.  That is some of the sciencey stuff I like to do.
Yeah true, good point. Glad we have past philosophers like Newton and Percipientus to help us out.
Yes, we definitely have.    There are over 300 registered superheroes in the United States, but not sure how many registered superheroes are in the US.
No I never knew that, kind of funny. I do know that there is a man named normal man though, and he is named that because he is normal.
Interesting. I've never read a comic like that, have you?
That would be interesting, I think a Garfield book series spinoff named pet would be a change, it would feature Garfield and gang as superheroes.  Maybe it would force them to change their names, or maybe it would be like the Garfield bookseries spinoff that would feature garfield and gang with a named pet.
That sounds awesome! They should move to the town of the avengers, and Garfield could become the new avengers.
For real! Stan lee once wrote 15 DC comics, reimagining popular superheroes like batman and superman.
I know they were huge at the Marvel time.
Yeah that is a good question.  There is a comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes.  Yeah he did a comic about that.  Well it was nice talking with you today.
Same here!  Thanks!
Hi, have you seen the Batman movie?
I do. Did you know that Superman gave Batman a kryptonite ring?
Yes that was a gift from him to a villain named Condiment King, did you hear about the villain named condiment king?
Hmm, yes, I did. Superman gave him a ring in case he ever went rogue and needed to be stopped.
wow good thinking there. The condiment king was defeated by slipping on his own ketchup
Wow. Keaton refused to play batman in batman forever. He was offered $10 million. He said no. He got to play Batman in batwoman in batmen forever for only $500 million.
Wow, amazing.  I did not know that.  Did you know that the Batman logo is the one from the old west that is on the molar of the batman's logo?
Nice. The growl of batman was nolan's fault not bale's.
Nice. Do you know where Gotham City is located?
Hmm I think it is New York, where?
It is New jersey!  Do you know if it is canon or not?
Very cool. Do you like comic books?
I like some of them. Stan Lee finished his calls in them.
Hmm I do not know that, do you know?
It is the word Excelsior.
Cool. Marvel had to spend 20 years to convince the government that X-men were not human!
Wow crazy. One of the marvel cinematic universes takes place in earth-199919.
That is really cool.  Do you know how the word brainiac came about?
Hmm not sure, I think it stands for something though, do you?
Hmm not really sure.  The word brainiac comes from the supervillain in Superman.  It means "one who is brainiac".
Cool. DC stands for detective comics.
do you like literature? Do you like novels?
I love it.  I can't believe the FDA once burned tons of books.
No, that is sad and a pitty about the censorship.  How pitty of them.
 Churchill once won the nobel litarature prize.
Yeah and in a literature contest the most worst opening sentence wins. Do you know what a worst opening sentences wins in a Literature contest is?
Haha I wonder how they do that, I bet that is fun to do though.
yeah, I know. Did you know literature was an olympic sport from 1912 to 1952?
Yeah it is, along with sculpture, painting, painting , sculpture, music and so on
Yeah. Romantic kissing was also pretty absent in ancient literature, did you know that?
Yeah. Do you have a favorite shirt?
Yes I do, I like polos, do you? They were invented in 1886 and not invented in 1869
I have no idea, I think it was tennis player Rene Lacoste, right?
Yeah. Polo players adopted it too
Yeah. Did you know in Hawaii it is business attire?
Yes the aloha shirt, cool name for it,
Yes and knowwww and comfy as well
I agree. Do you know what the Like button is?
The button down is where collar tips fasten to the shirt, not the body of the shirt.
Yes, and button up is a button down on the shirt where you fasten it to the shirt itself.
Yes that's what the pallbeares wore at Billy Mays funeral.
Yes they wore blue shirt and khaki pants
Hi there! I don't like how Ted Koppel victim-blamed.  Talking about sexual harassment, did you know that women wear short skirts and he said that it's the fault of the women?
What do you mean?  If a woman wears one and does not want attention, then doesn't matter what she does.
Yes, and catcalls while jogging in sweat pants is the most wanted and unwanted attention.
Koppel was in the biz for a while and got busted for sexist and harassing behavior. Lots of men in the industry do that.
I think school is where you go to school, but it never excuses behavior that is acceptable today.
I don't know. I think he probably does. He's used that sort of behavior in the workplace. The t-shirt was invented in 1904 and was marketed to bachelors who needed to be able to sew or replace buttons on their t-shirts.
The t-shirt fact makes sense.  I worked a bit in Hawaii when I was in business on the mainland.  The business attire back in the day was quite different from the way it is now.  Aloha, aloha.  That t- shirt fact makes me think a bit more of what you say a bit of a bit here.  T-shirt is a bit different now from back in 1904, though.
I think Hawaii has a spirit of its own world. Levi's jeans helped create casual Fridays in workplaces all over the world.
True. Clothing sends messages. I live in Phoenix so we are always layered. We dress pretty fast in the heat. We are pretty fast with shirts and gang shirts and such. Fashion is definitely adopted everywhere. In China, clothing sends messages, and formal dress is adopted.
That was a smart move.  Especially in a place like Phoenix with the heat.  I wear jeans because that is the Chinese fashion guideline.  On a different note, do you know what the chinese fashion guideline is for when you wear jeans in a heat?
No, I wear them only once a year during a few weeks in December and January.  Shorts are pretty common.  But the ladies in my baptist church wear pants so long as they are tight and the skin is not tight.  We have a few week long weeks in January for the baptist Church.
I don't like skin tight jeans, lol, I like short skirts.  Ted Koppel used to be in skin tight Jeans, I think.
I didn't know that the small pocket in jeans was designed for pocket watches.
That's funny.  Kids used to call it their "booger bank" to put their boogers!  It's funny that blue jeans are outlawed in North Korea - a symbol of American imperialism - because blue jeans were outlawed in Korea.
I heard that.  I hope they can erase that from their mind.  They need to erase it from my mind, too.  If I am wearing jeans and a watch pocket, I hope it doesn't go in my watch pocket.  Levi's had a great marketing move in the 1980s making denim jeans and tuxedo for Bing Crosby.  A levi's tux is a great way to marketing a denim tux.
Jeans are totally wholesome.  A student lived on a pair of jeans for 6 months, when school didn't let him, and the student wore them for 4 months.  He went back to school in them.
I wonder if they called them Blue jeans? I surely would have if I had done that. I have never worn the same jeans for 15 months, but I would have loved to start over. I wonder if I would like washing them every year when I went to school and I would loved to try on the premium jeans that the Levi's that the premium Jeans are made of to start with, but surely not the $300 premium jeans I would need to keep them on for 15 years of washing.
I think the safest clothes to wear are those that wash after a few days of wear, the amount of germs are less and the jeans have more days of play in them, so I think jeans are the safest clothing to wear after just a few day's wash.
Wow, that is awful!  I'm totally inactive and I have sweat and the smell of my sweat is just awful! I wonder if that's why there are half a dozen jeans brands co-owned by WNBA, and half adozen jeans brandsCo-owned By WNBA
I've worn the Wrangler, Levi's, and Levi's.  The only way I ever got them was in navy.  I know how well it markets jeans though.  Did you know they have a little cheat at the waist to help the waist?
I can understand how skinny they can be, too tight when lifting things, but jeans can cause nerve damage if you have a metal watch band in them, like a metal band. Nice talk!
do you like superheroes?  Do you like DC superheroes?
I love superheroes, but don't have a favorite. What about you?
I dont really like superheroes, I like a couple of the Spider-Man movies, and I like the Spiderman movies, but I dont have one that I like more than the others.
I have not seen any of those yet but it looks good, there are plenty of superheroes to pick from, there's already over 300 registered in the United States, there have to be some registered in there, right?
Do you think registering a superhero is necessary?  I mean, I mean you can make your own, but to get registered, how do you get registered?
I was thinking the same thing.  I'm not sure.  Maybe I'll get one of those graphic designs and get registered for my own superhero.  LOL  I have some ideas.  The funniest thing is that every person with superpowers on the planet is actually a superhero, and that the planet isn't full of just normalman/superheroes.  Kind of kind of like a musician writes a song about being a normalman, but the song is actually registered, so maybe the musician is a superhero!  I wonder if he has any superpowers or just thinks of ideas, like a songs that the musician writes?  I think he might be into graphic designs.
That's a really interesting character! I guess he was a interesting setting for strange stories, but I think I would like that character to see some day. I like the interesting setting
Sounds like he became the character after struggling with being a superhero with special super powers.  He must be digging the bottom of the barrel with normalman. lol
Yeah, i dont watch superhero films that often, they get a bit stale. the backstories start to sound like they are not special enough. superpowers, superpowers and all that. i dont like that.
I like Garfield, there is a superhero spinoff series named Pet Force, I wonder what is that about. I also like the superhero spinoffs series named PET Force.
I guess they are desperate for content.  I don't know if I would watch it.  The explosions are enough, but if the story is good and the story has an interesting way to go I would not watch it, but explosions?  I guess not.
I think they are getting fake news, the graphics are too real, like digital enhanced landscapes, not real.
I think it is the reason that the comic book film has not developed as much, it is not developed enough for the characters and plot.  For example, spider-man is a comic book for people who dont like to read comic books for the reason why it is a film for people of an older audience.  I do not like spider-men.
Speaking of spider-man and comic books, I recently read that the word "excelsior" was used to end the phone call you had recently.  I think it was sad that Stan Lee passed away.  It's a word that means "excellence".
lol  He lived to age 85 so he had a good long life.  I wonder if he made a million a year just for staying alive for that long.  He must have made a lot of $$$ and lived to aged 85.  That is a good old age for staying Alive.
LOL.  Did you ever hear of Manga comics?  They've been around for over 100 years and it exploded when it exploded into the States.  The market in Japan was valued at $1.2 billion dollars in 2003.  Holy cow!
Yeah, the comic industry is big, but not for the fans.  I think the money is there for people that work long hours, low pay and on the bottom of the bottom.  Long hours, long pay, no fans, and no money...
Did you know dc comics stands for detective comics?
yeah, I had heard that. detective comics comics. very creative. Anyway, great chat!
I'm not really much of a comic book fan, but I had a good time learning about them at Michigan State University library! LOL I'm going to go look for books to keep me going through the night and get up in the world.
Have a great night too!
You too. Thanks for chatting!
Hi, how are you?  Are you a big fan of literature and reading?  I enjoy books, books and reading, and many other hobbies.
I like to read a lot.  Funny thing is that these days I spend more time listening to music than reading.  Thinking back to my fav authors and reading... I don't know if I've seen any.  Who are some of your fav authors?
I enjoy Orwell, Stephen King, Iris Melvin, I really like Stephen King. I find that he's the one to find the best value in literature despite all the censorship. I also really enjoy Vonnegut, he has tons of novels that are really depressing, apparently the FDA burned 6 tons of his novels at one point, the FDA's burned 6,000 of Vonneguts novels because of censorship, how depressing!
I read some of the Vonnegut books a few years ago, but his earliest works are the most famous and one of the earliest works I can think of. He has a unique talent.
I would love to read everything he writes. I love that he is so insightful and yet not feeling pretentious at the same time. He made the complex simple and profound without ever feeling like he was feeling pretension.
I know, it was so perfectly stated, and incredibly profound.. It was like Reading a book for children at all times and it was alive with the times and everything perfectly stated.
Yes, he fell off the ladder at an older age and passed away.  He was banned from the schools several times but chose to decorate his living room with a framed book with quotes from his novels in several spots.  I think that is why Fahrenheit 451 was banned in the schools.  It was a book that he chose to paint and decorate the living room in spots.
I've never read any of his books.  I sort of run out of books that I want to remind myself of in a short period of time to read.  Farenheit 451 is the one that I think will remind me of it.
Yes, I've read Fahrenheit 451.  I liked Billy Pilgrim, too.  He's a young, young soldier and pow, unstuck in time and life becomes non-linear.  In it, he tells the story of an optometrist who becomes unstuck from his time as an optometry student and becomes unst stuck in time as he becomes a soldier and Pow.
I sort of recall reading that somewhere back when it came out, and it was depressing.  I was vague about the remark about the FDA burning tons of literature.  It was a vague sort of recalling reading about "breakfast of champions.."
I apologize, I realized what I typed when I first typed it, I was thinking about burning a Vonnegut book but never realized it was a form of censorship when discussing a VonNegut book before I realized that.  I'm thinking of how Ray Bradbury did the plot of Fahrenheit 451 when he uses a Vonneut book as a model for the plot to Slaughterhouse-Five when the titles are switched.  Burning books is like censorship in a different form.  It seems to be the same way with "The Big Short".  If you read it you will appreciate it more because it is a great comedy with a lot of comedy.  Did you know that in the novel "A Scanner Darkly" the main characters are based on the characters from the novel of the same name, but the names of the books are different?  That's why the title and the plot are switched!
No problem, I had not heard of Bradbury before, but Slaughterhouse-Five a fabulous book I remember discussing with you years ago, great book, and I am familiar with it, but never heard of him.
I would definitely recommend Fahrenheit 451, a fantastic book. I've never read it but I'm amazed that it was banned and censored. I don't think Shakespeare had any valid reason for censoring his books, but I agree that censoring is a valid reason to do so. I think I would recommend Fahrenheit 1569, but Slaughterhouse-five. I can't believe teenagers were able to read it and think it was fine. I mean, Shakespeare is so mature and I know he did not want his books censored.
I can't remember the name of Slaughter-House-Five but I remember the book had some dark overtones but valuable to read.  I can't think of many books that have dark over tones but valuable for sure.  Did you know that the concentration camps were known as " concentration camps" before WW II?
Yes, very dark. I think he treated that one very well. The cat cradle was about a camp in dresden that was bombed and had no casualties but the casualties were extremely high. pow. Did you know that books can develop ice in the dark, like a cat that freezes when it is treated with water or if it is in a cat cradle, it instantly becomes ice. I wonder how that is treated in a camp.
I remember reading that book when I was in high school and the memory of that book coming back over and over in my memory for years.  Fortunately, he is good at coming back to his memory.  He is a little different than the Rye, catcher, which was censored during the censorship of the 70's.  I remember reading it in highschool and it was censored because it was about a cat.
I can understand banning it but not why they made these decisions. I read Hamlet once and it was very confusing, it was like, "who kills who, and who gets murdered, and why? I can't see why you would do that, but you can't, so you must do what kills you," so I can understand bans but why do you think they were banned? Do you read Hamlets at all?
In those cases any type of sexual scenes, or in some cases any kind of sexual stuff is sort of considered off limits.  The thing is that many times I've read it in the early 1900s it was about a catcher.  I think that was a different times, and maybe there was some sexual stuff in it.
I think it was banned for a bit, but then there was hysteria at that point and it was a bit more out there.
It seems absurd. censorship is a judgemental type of thing. People can read whatever they want but it doesn't keep them away from certain groups of people. It just effects the way people think. I can't see people thinking that way if people can read what they want. It's absurd, but it can have very serious effects on other groups of person.
I agree.  It is.
There seems to be a lot of controversy about the anti sexual harrasnemt activist and Ted Koppel.
Ted Koppel?  What does Ted Kopple mean ? The guy that was sexually harassed?
He is a 70 year old man.  I think there is some controversy that he is old fashioned.
I guess he is old fashioned about sexual harassment.
I agree!  Do you like literature?  Do You like to read?
Yes I do.  How about you?
Yeah me too. I think it is unfair that the FDA burnes down 4 tons of books, that seems unfair
It sounds like something that would be illegal even for the Nazis.
I think its.  I guess the whole time it wasnt a "nazi thing" but it does sound like they were censoring info from people.  It does sound that way.
I'm just thankful they are ignorant and want to protect the naive and the innocent from the FDA, not the innocent.
I'm sure they are. Books and information are powerfull tools in the wrong hands, dangerous in the right hands.
Yes, they are. They can disappear in the hands of the FDA if you don't put them on right, or disappear if they're not put on right. Do you wear shirts?
I wear them almost everyday!
No, I don't really have a habit of it, but I do find shirts constraining in that I don's I can't wear clothing that I'm not comfortable in public situations where people are apt to wear them. I find shirts Constraining in certain places and not comfortable at all in other public situations.
Yeah I like to wear polo shirts, they are comfortable, and they stay on so well.
I used to play polo, or as they call it the elite of the elite, shirt, I used to wear it and understand why they like to wear them.
I see. Did you know that the shirt was invented by tennis players?
Yes, the tennisso shirt.  Did you know that they call it a pollo shirt, which is the chicken in Spanish, a strange name for a shirt, or a polla shirt?
I agree it's a strange name, but I agree with the strage culrural revolution gang, China has a name like that, it was from the Stages of the Century, the strages of Stare Culrural Revolution gang
I know, the word "China" is a strange one, but I was surprised to know that every country makes something with a word like that, including chicken shirts.  I wonder what the Chinese think of those.  Maybe not so strange.
I mean all countries have strage traditions, not just some of the ones in the US.
Hello, do you like superheroes?
I do like superheroes! Do you like them?
I do, I like comic books and movies, do you?
Yes they are. Have you seen the tv show "The Titans"  It is on the channel on the CW
I have seen the cartoon teenage titans.
It's from the 70s. It picks up Robin, but leaves Batman behind, and picks upRobin. I'll have to watch it again, sounds interesting.
Robin has never seen Robin before, so I don't really know his life before then.
I know my son watches teen titans all the time.  When they turn 15 and he's worried that they won't allow him to watch it when he is turn 18, I think he's going to watch all the more when his son watches Teen Titans.
Did you know Robin is a sidekick to the superhero and not a superhero in the show?
I don't know. I haven't seen any of the Batman shows, but there is a website with a channel that has all the Batman Shows on a website. It sounds really interesting. Do you read a lot?
Yeah Batman has been around a long time, it started back in 1939.
I used to watch the reruns of the Adam West shows when I was younger, when I could.  I haven't seen those in years though.  Did you ever watch the Reruns when they were on tv?
I did, I liked the reruns, the ones with the batman logo put on their teeth!
I had no idea, I think that was the condiment king, or maybe he let it slip and it caught on as a super power.
 condiment king? I wonder what kind of power he had that he slipped on, or slipped on his own power?
He shot ketchup and slipped on it, Batman then caught him.  We have limited creativity back here.
lol  I know!  Some writers are so odd!  Batman is one of the only enemies of the writers,  but he has superpowers!  I think Batman could be the odd one out.  LOL
True. That's what I knew about batman's powers. I also knew that New Jersey is home to Gotham City, but not Gotham. I wonder if the villains in the canon had any of the Batman powers too, or if it was just for the villains.
I always thought it was New York, I didn't know that!
I never knew that!  I knew the Joker and batman were from there.
I think it's because I've seen the movies and the show so much I can remember them all. They're all calling each other by name, but they're not the same character.
Hey there!  Do you know much about the show the Flash?
I have seen it before. Did you know he outran death in the rusn so fast?
I did not know that, I'm going to have to look into it lol. I did watch that 70s show, it's really good, he told us he was good at that show
Yeah he outran death by running past entropy, give or take.  The universe has nothing to give.
That is pretty cool. I guess the main character, Allen, uses his super speed to fight criminals.
Yes and he has travelled back in time to the 1960s.
I guess.  I wonder if that is where the show started back in the 70s?  Did you know the show Arrow had a spin-off for a few seasons and the spin- off is the show arrow?
I think there are about 6 seasons, I think.  The guy who plays the Flash, the guy who play his dad on that show has never seen the show before.
That's a cool throwback to the place. I guess a bolt of lightning gave the Flash powers, I wonder how that would happen exactly haha.
He got hit by a lightning and then woke up with a bunch of powers like outrunning death and a bunch others
I guess Death is called the Black Flash, and that's a really cool name.  I wonder how you outruns him, time, or space.  Another cool thing about death is that Deadpool does Gideons voice in space. I guess Death was a person who could outrun him, but I wonder if he did it all the time.
Nice, I wonder if there is any overlap in their names? I wonder how much collateral damage these guys do together.
haha that would be pretty crazy. At one point people thought the earth was the center of the universe, that's pretty crazy! I wonder if they thought the Earth was the Center of the Universe.
I do know some stuff.  Like the universe might just be one giant hologram.  I don't really believe in the universe.
I have heard that theory before, I have no idea how that would really work though haha. I like the idea of only having one electron in the universe, I wonder how that is possible though, I also think that there is only one electron ever in the Universe
Yeah and also that universes evolve.
That's interesting.  I wonder what it would be like to visit a star that is cold enough to be touched by a human hand.  If they could, I guess we could visit it but if they exist they would be cold, I don't think they would ever allow the human hand to be touch them.
It is believed that there is a region of the observable universe that may be pulling galaxies outside of the known universe.
That's crazy! Do you like superheroes? I guess they started in the 1930s.
Superman is a classic, my favorite one, do you have a favorite?
I like Batman a lot. I think he's the best of the rest. I like the Marvel universe the best for the same reason I like Batman. Did you know there are over 300 registered superheroes in the United States and there are more registered superheroes than there are registered superheroes for the rest of the Marvel Universe.
Candice Patton did not realize what starring in a flash was going to mean for her until she saw that she was playing a role that she had previously played. She was playing as a white woman and did not even realize what star she was.
It's surprising that people were upset about that, in this modern day and age, isn't it?
It was a shame to see people acting like that.
Apparently she did that for a subset of people who really liked her role.  It seems like a lot of people did.  She's definitely done a lot for a few subset of the subset of People.
I think it's always difficult for people to see change.
True, apparently The Flash is the network most popoular superhero shows.
That show is terrific, it's not set in stone as Patton adds but I think people have accepted the change.
I have never watched it, but I will check it out. I like superhero shows and I like Jessica Jones. I'll have to check it Out.
 scheduling is hard with superhero shows says Patton, you should skip some sleep and do it now, you can get away with it, scheduling is difficult.
The Flash can outrun and defeat death by outracing everyone at the end of time and space.  Pretty convenient that he doesn't have to worry about the end to the end.  The Flash can just outrun AND defeat death, even at the very end ofTime and Space.  I don't think I could do both at once.
I wonder how fast he can go. He would have to shoot 50 episodes a year, but that is enough time to film a movie. I wonder if the actors would need to spend time shooting that many episodes. I think they have to spend about 10 episodes to film 50 episodes, so that would take time toFilm 10 episodes a movie, and then spend time filming 50 episodes in a year.
I wonder how Patton is doing that. Apparently it was such a successful show that they were able to make it to 100 a year, apparently it is the most successful show ever!
I did not know that Morena Baccarin from Deadpool is Gideon's voice in Flash!
Interesting, I didn't know that.  It's kind of confusing.  The flash takes place in the past and it gave him the powers in the first place.  Pure energy.
Do you know there are over 300 registered superheroes in the US?
I did not know that! That is a lot. Do you have a favorite superhero?
I personally like spiderman and the flash. What about you?
I have never heard of Normalman.  Is that a person without superpowers?  A planet full of superheroes?  I don't like a planet full.  I like a person with superpowers.
No but that sounds interesting. Marvel creator Lee wrote 15 comics.
I would not have guessed that.
Hello, did you ever watch the TV show Archer? I saw it on fxx.
Yes, I have watched the first season and some episodes of the second season.  It is good, but not as good as the first one.
It's good. I heard they did the same thing in real life too. They didn't know they were with the corporation ISIS until ISIS until 2014. I guess that's a new thing inReal Life now.
That's pretty interesting. It premiered in the US in the first place in 2011.
Yep, I like the Hollywood thriller genre, but not so much the noir genre.  There are some comedic ones in the noirs, apparently for instance the new season apparently for example is going to be comedic
Wow, I am intrigued to watch that one.  I am also intrigued to watches anime as well.
I do watch anime, one of my favorites is the anime Akira. Do you watch anime?
I like Studio Ghibli movies. There is a show in Japan called powerpuff girls show in japan called powerpuffs.
Wow I didn't know that.  I did see Cowboy Bebop was the first anime to be put on the television network Adult Swim.  Did you see that?
I have never seen it, but Adult Swim has quite a few episodes.  I have watched Pokemon though.  It has over 750 episodes!
No I have seen a few episodes, but not that many.  I love Pokemon!  I think they have 750 episodes.
Yes, I love them too. I spent a lot of my youth watching them and playing Pokemon. I know the series finale of Mewtwo strikes back was supposed to be the series series finale. I think Mewtwo Strikes back was the series that I spent most of my days playing.
I never knew that! I wish I knew that I was good at Pokemon back in the day haha.
LOL, me too! I was never a fan of anime, but I could have guessed who was. I did know John Cena was a fan!
Me neither.  I would have thought it would be the scientists.  He must know more scientists than I do.
I do, I think my cousin just recently started her career in one.  I would have thought she would have been one of the first scientist to walk on the moon, Harrison Schmitt.  He was the only scientist to Walk on the Moon.  That's pretty awesome!
Yep I would have thought so too.  I think it's cool that the emperor of Japan is a scientist and publishes papers as well.  He is a physicist and scientist and publish papers!
That is so cool. It seems like a lot of people in positions of power are very knowledgeable of certain fields like science.
Yep I agree!  I know scientist John von Neumann was so smart he was able to divide by 3 digit numbers over and over in his head at the age of 18!  How smart,  how did he divide that many numbers in hisHead?
Totally crazy.  He must be very talented to preform math at that young.  You know, someone could converse in ancient greek and still be talented in math!
 genius, genius, geniuses!  Sounds like those Harvard scientists that put a gif in the DNA of a bacteria lol that poor bacteria lol  That poor bacteria, they are geniuses.  I wonder why they did that.  Maybe it was the animation of the galloping horse from the animation by Harvard scientists or the gallop of a horse from a horse in the dna?
Hello! How are you today?
Hello, I am great! How are you?  Do you like anime?
I do! I am more of a fan of comedy.
I have seen a couple movies. Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school to pursue comedy.
He made a wise choice. Harvard wasn't the best thing for him. Demetri Martin kind of did the same thing but at the same time, he made a smart choice.
Wow. That was a pretty risky choice. Do you like the genre of bromantic comedies?
I do like them because the guy can always relate lol
I am a guy myself, so yes I do enjoy that as well! I really like The hangover and Pineapple Express. Both are good and I am not a guy.
Who is your favorite comedic actor? I like Bill Murray.
He is pretty funny, one of my favorite actors is Seth Rogan, he is pretty Funny.
He is a funny man!  He was awesome in slapstick comedies back in the day.
Did you ever watch pokemon growing up?
I did, I think they brought out a new Pokemon movie with Mewtwo in it, crazy, I wonder if it was better than the old pokemon movie
Absolutely!  I have fond memories of the series growing up, and mewtwo strikes back was supposed to be the series finale!
I know right!  I think it was the powerpuff girls did,  but only for like 10 episodes lol
Yeah, pretty much everyone was pretty well burned out at that point.  I used to love them at that time.
Nice!  I like spice, sugar, spice, and spice!  hahaha  There is an actual Japanese anime that is called Powerpuff Girls.
Interesting, I am not a fan of anime, but I like it. John Cena is a fan, which is not surprising considering he is one.
Interesting indeed lol. His favorite anime is called Fist of the North Star, which is interesting indeed lol, and his favorite Anime is called FInal!
I think I've seen that show once, Daft Punk apparently released an anime movie too.
No I haven't seen it.  I'm going to go look for it now though.  It's been nice chatting with you.  Have a great day!
Hey there, do you ever browse reddit? It's basically an american social news aggregation.
I dont spend too much time on it.  I dont spend much time at all.  You?
I find it interesting that in February of this year they had 137 million monthly visitors and they had 58.46 million monthly visitor in 2017.
That's a lot. It is the third most visited site in the US.
That is impressive!  I wonder how much of the people who visit vote on the content given the traffic and popularity, do you think the people that visit vote for the content?
What is that?  I wonder why.
I don't know, it is kind of ironic lol.  I wonder if they ever had a complaint about it,  the first comment on reddit was a complaint!
I wasnt sure if that was about reddit going downhill or something.
Yes, it was! The people of Reddit are passionate no doubt. They even made an online magazine called the redditor.
That's a compilation of some of the big things around Reddit!
Good question, I don't know, there are so many funny animal pictures on reddit that I don' t know. There are about 20 quintillion animals on earth!
I did not know that! I wonder if that was in Germany, I think it is?
haha that's kind of cool, I wonder if it goes back to 1805 though
I need to take care of my dog, though. I can't live without her, but I need a new place where I can take care to take her.
Interesting. In Scotland they took a step forward and protected the mythical Loch Ness monster in 1912.
I think that a dead Nessie is in their hands now.  I dont know about you but I dont see how they can dead NessIE
True. I used to play tetris growing up. I never knew it was designed by a Russian programmer, I wonder how it wasdesigned?
I did it was one of my favorite games. Did you?
I have one of the best selling video games of all time, so addicting! I am going to have to look into it. It was so nice chatting with you this evening! Thanks for your time!
Same here have a great one. Have a nice night.
Bye! :)  Thanks!
do you use reddit?  I don't know much about it.
I fall into the percentage of the people who visit actually participate in voting for content, I use Reddit to read about stuff.
I do, it's nice that the "Deeds People do" page sums up some of the deeds people do on there.
I wonder what kind of deeds that people have done on that page. I think I added that one.
I have no idea what that stands for, I am assuming that it is because they invented Reddit.
No, I don't, who invented reddit? I did hear that there are some scandals surrounding Facebook, I think.
Yeah that is a good point, it was Alexis Onahan, he was one of the first people to do it and yeah he is the only one, I think, that is the best way to say it.
I think I have heard of that guy, he is from Reddit, the gal from the gal. I think he is affiliated with the company, Reddit is a company.
No I don't think so. Did you know he is married to the tennis legend Serena Williams?
Williams invested in the company early on, Reddit as a result, and as a Result she owns about a third of the company.
Alexis was the first person to post it, I believe.
There are some interesting threads about animals on there, I've noticed that the domesticated develop a white patch on their foreheads, I wonder why?
I didn't know that either. Do you know why we have hiccups? I have a dog, and I don't get hiccup's
I have not seen one of my pets have the hiccups. I wonder why they get hicc ups?
It's a holdover from when animals had lungs and gills.
Wow!  Do you know why hiccups are associated with animals?  I wonder why we have hiccup?
Yes, I guess so. It is cool that the constitution now protects the animals in the US and Germany.
That is pretty neat. I wonder if I should have checked that, is bratwurst a big thing in Germany? Or is animals truly protected?
I think they are protected against abuse and such.  Dogs are a protected species, but I wonder if they are more protected than the Losh Ness monster, which is a protectedspecies.
I wonder if other animals are also protected from abuse, I have no idea what Losh Ness monsters are, they sound frightening, but I have never seen them.
I'm not sure if there is one, but I'm sure we do something to protect them.  The Loch Ness monster is a mythical creature, I wonder what it is?
Hello, do you use reddit?
I love reddit! Do you love reddit?
I do like it, but I don't vote.  Do you vote?
I do, I like the voting thing. Do you?
Yes,  all of the time.  Do you like to read?
I do as well. It is organized by subjects.
I like to read it as well, I read it almost everyday.
It had 137 million visitors in 2017 and more than 1.5 million in 2016 alone.
That's a lot. I am wholly molly sure it's a whole lot. Do you like animals?
I love animals.  There are about 1.5 million of them in the US.  That's so many!
That's pretty cool. Did you know animals develop white patches on their head when they are domesticated? That's why animals develop black patches when they're domesticated.
I did not know that.  That is neat.  I did not even know they had dominant paws.
Did you know the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species?
I did not know that, there is something really neat about loch ness I think. I think I would rather have a dog than be pawed haha.
I know, right?  Lochness is the national mascot.  I wonder what the name is?
I don't know.  Maybe.  There's a lawyer who represents animals in court.
That's awesome!  Who is this?
Yes that is in Switzerland, do you know his name?
Yes for some reason he always wanted to visit there. It was so nice chatting with you!
Nice to chat with you too!
Have a good weekend. Take it easy!
I have some interest in Marvel comic, it started production in 1938.
Wow.  That's a long time.  I've seen some stuff, but not much.  Not a fanatic like I used to be.
I haven't read much since I was a kid but enjoy some of the movies since Disney bought Marvel.
That was a good move, Star Wars is a huge franchise, good move by them
Yea, the funny thing is Sony had the chance to buy the film rights to all the marvel characters for $25 million and they bought spiderman for $15 million and then they bought all the Marvel characters for only $50 million, they really should have bought Spiderman for only 75 million
Wow, that was quite the oversight.
Yep, I don't care for those characters, but Sony just paid $130 billion for Spiderman in 2004. I wonder if they care for other characters, too? Sony just pay $15 million for SpiderMan 3.
Marvel does a better job of keeping the universes separate, I mean, the one character that is the same is the only one, so they do a better jobs at keeping the universe separate.
Yea I wonder if Disney and Warner Bros have the access to him?  They want to make a movie about him so they could make a film that Disney and DC would both have access to.
I think that would be pretty cool, Disney doesnt really do big characters well, they like their big characters best, but they do have some big names.
Yea, it's a shame that Disney can't use spiderman or avengers rides due to universal studios contract, I wonder if disney world will have spiderman and avengers amusement rides on it
Yeah, I would love for disney to create superhero land but the contract has a time limit.
I think they should make an attraction like the superhero Blue Ear who wears a hearing aid.
I heard about this little boy who told his mom that superheroes dont wear hearing aids.  He was created by a boy who tell his mom, "Superheroes dont wear Hearing aids, I don't want to wear one."
Yep.  I have seen all of the Star Wars movies.  But I prefer the original trilogy.  Did you ever watch any of the new ones?  I like them but I prefer The Original trilogy.
I like the original trilogy better, jar jar binks and the rest of the Star Wars movies.
Yea I think the original Star Wars were the best, too bad Marcia Lucas did not like the second ones too
I think she played a bigger role in the first movies than people realize. I am glad she won the academy award for editing.
Yea, she was the one that tried to convince George Lucas to not make Han solo a large green alien in E.T. to convince him not to make Han Solo
Yes, I'm glad they didn't do that. It would of made things pretty bad
Nice chatting with you!  Have a nice one!
Do you have any favorite villains?  I really like the Joker.
I do like him, do you like Harley Quinn?
Yeah Harley Quinn is really hot, I think she is badass, did you ever watch the movie Suicide Squad? She is really badass,
I watched it with my daughter. It is surprisingly funny.
The special effects were not that great but the cast was good I didnt like Jared Leto as the Joker, but I thought the rest of the cast is great, and the special effects are also good I didn't like Jared leto, I liked him better as theoker
I didn't like the part he played either.  I can see why casting parts like that would be extremely difficult to make.  It is not something that would appeal the masses.  The movie was very successful because he did not appeal to me.  That is why I think casting parts for a movie like that one was extremely difficult.
I think I have no idea, it would be a hard role to play, but I think he would have been a great choice, he was my favorite joker and his favorite jokers, he should have been the one to play Heath Ledger, too bad he passed up that role, I think that movie would have had a great idea, hard role for a joker,
He played that part perfectly. He was the best. There's been a lot of good superhero movies. Spiderman is one of them. I think Marvel Comics has done a lot.
I did not see the movie. What is the latest one?
I did watch the latest ones, it was surprisingly good. I am a bigger Disney fan than Marvel Comics, but they are both surprisingly good too.
Marvel is now owned by Disney.  Sony had the chance to buy them for a low price.  Marvel superheroes have been owned by disney since the 70s.  The stone is in the Stone that causes kills to birds and also kills to animals.  Did you know that?
Wow! Sony must be regretting that decision. I heard that they bought the rights to feature all the characters from Marvel and now they're big, big, BIG!  I wonder if they ever bought all of the Marvel and DC theme parks. Disney has a theme parks in the east and west, one in Mississippi and the others at Disney Land in California. I wonder which one will feature Marvel and which will feature DC characters.  I've heard Sony might have to go east to Mississippi to get out of there.
Yeah I bet they can, Disney is also buying all mayor franchises now and also Star Wars.
They basically secure their place as one of the major entertainment companies in the entertainment world, they are basically secure.
yeah, smart moves.  do you like the Star Wars franchise?
I love the Star wars franchise, I have kids and they love the movies and watch them frequently, I like all of the movies, I also like part of Han Solo, Pacino originally wanted to be part of Hans Solo
Good thing he didnt get the role, he would have turned it down, I bet he regretted not getting the part, I wonder what he would of done if he had gotten the part
I think it was because he couldn't understand the script of the picture. He turned down the part because he didn't like Han Solo.  lol.  He didn't understand that he was not in the part and that he couldn's understand theScript.
He did not want to take the part because he didn't want to become famous for the part?  That is a mayor's mistake!  It's funny that it is also the most successful film merchandising franchise.
I bet he has a lot of regrets about that now.  He should try to get more movie roles.  I wonder how many he could get.
Yeah, I think so. Well, great chatting with you. Have a great one. I have to go see Han Solo, now.
Same here have a great day
How's it going, did you know astronauts in space can't whistle?
I had no clue... I wonder if it's because of weightlessness?  I can't believe Apollo 13 cast had to do filming in NASA's zero-gravity plane.  I don't think I would want to be cast in that.
Astronauts are pretty lucky. It is really interesting how they can go back to earth after going into space but general motors can't go back.  They should give a free corvette when they come back to Earth.  Or maybe give afree corvette to the astronauts.
Yea, they are lucky and they are at risk, the moon dust can cut through spacesuit material and be bad for health, moon dust and moon dust could cut through space suits and the spacesuits themselves, so that is a risk
Wow, it can cut through spacesuit material?  I don't personally know how that could be.  If you travel in space, did you know the water in the vapor cloud in space is 1 trillion times that of earth's water?  Wow, there is so much we have to learn about the earth to be able to travel there.  Did you know there is a vapor cloud that is 1.5 trillion times more water than there is water on earth?  That could cut through Spacesuits material.
That's crazy!   Japan is actually going to take a rock sample from an asteroid and return it back to earth.  That would be the first ever to do so.    I wonder if they will actually take the rock from the asteroid and Return it back from there.
I have learned a new lot from that rock sample!  Did you know that the Earth has over 7 million animal species.  It is estimated that there are over 7.5 million animalspecies on the earth!
Yea I know, it's nuts. There are more insects, but 1 million is way too many.
Did you know there is a protected species in Scotland?  If we ever discover the actual loch ness monster, it will be a protectedspecies in Scotland.
I wonder if it represented us?  There is a lawyer in Switzerland whose clients are animals, lol.  He is a lawyers who is represented by a lawyer.  His clients are animal.
I think I heard about that.  I think that's the only way to get a lawyer lol!  I wonder what kind of cases he got into?  It's weird how some things are allowed and some aren't.  Like Germany has granted the rights afforded by their constitution, where animals are concerned.  It seems like that should not be afforded to anyone, but they do.  They should do things according to their constitution as well.
Yes, and animals from different geographically areas communicate in many different dialects unique to themselves and even different languages, even if they do not speak the same languages.
Well, they sound so much alike. We are more advanced as species than originally thought, supposedly a hold on the animals hand and also are moreAdvanced as species. We have lungs and gills, we can hiccup and it sound like we are from back then and supposedly we hiccuper like we used to, but we actually have lungs, gills and lungs, supposedly we are much more advanced than originally Thought
Yes a lot of the animals we know are different from us. Did you know that lobsters and jellyfish are the only two animals that are biologically immortal?
That sounds interesting!  Science has given animals a kingdom called animalia.
Yea animals are cool, the Thor movies were some of my favorites, the fourth film, Mcu, is one of my favorite Thor films and the fourth one is the last one, the fifth one is my favorites
I liked Thor, I really liked Anthony Hopkins in it.  I like all the actors in them.
Anthony Hopkins was good as Odin and Tom Hiddleston was an excellent casting choice for Loki. Not as good as Loki but still an excellent choice for Odin.
Hiddleston was the perfect one for the role of Thor. He is perfect for the roles.
Yea I read that, I'm glad Hiddleston ended up being cast as Loki, he did well in the cast as Odin
I heard that the cast improvised some of the Ragnarok language, I wonder if that was the cast's improvised language?
I really enjoyed the movie Thor. Loki gained about 50 pounds of muscle when he turned into the role of Thor, and he turned out to be over 300 pounds of Muscle.
That is amazing. He had the perfect cast for Loki. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing him. He was the perfectcast for Loki!
Taika Waiti did a great job too.  It was improvised.  He improvised it out of laughter making gibberish sounds in the language they spoke.  They had a bust up over it!  He would bust out with laughter making  gibberISH sounds!
He picked it up at the gauntlet way back then, right?
Yeah I saw the gauntlet and I liked it, but I didn't like the gauntlets
I think it is the gauntlet Thanos use to destroy half of the universe. It is the one that can destroy life if it is given the wrong hand in Thor.  It is real and can destroy the universe, if given the right hand in thor it can destroy half the universe and the wronghand in the gauntlets Thanos uses it on himself.
 clarifying, I was really surprised by that statement. I was confused by that too, and confused by the statement about the Loch Ness monster. The Loch Ness Monster is an animal called that. It sounds so frightening, I would be surprised by it.
I love it. I think it has some of the theories about it, like being a dinosaur, but I don't know if it is actually a dinosaur.
Yes, that sounds so grand and gigantic!  I was watching Jurassic Park and it sounds like it's accurate.  I think I'd rather be watching Jurassic park than any of the 20 quintillion animals in existence.  There were 20 quintillions of dinosaurs in the day, and they all grew extinct!  They say that the last dinosaurs are in existence, and I wonder why they grew extinct.
I would love to study zoology and all of the animals in the rain forest.
That is so true, I love animals, it's so interesting but at the same time alarming at the time alarming with all its intricate food webs and food chains, and how interesting it is!
I love animals too, but I have seen the food chains first hand when I was growing up.  I know the roles that the insects can play and the roles we have in those food chains.  Did you know that there are over 7 million insects in our country?  That's more than the 1 million insects that we have growing up!
Wow, I recently started raising some chickens, I am amazed by eggs coming from an actual animal, the detailed events in them, I have recently started raised some chickens as well, and I am always amazed by their detailed events.
Amazing!  There is a theory that domesticated animals develop patches of white on their head, like horses.  I wonder why?  I know that there is a theorists theory that domestic animals develop patch.
Yeah, that is an interesting fact to learn. I am not sure either, I am more excited about space exploration. I think it's pretty funny that astronauts have certain restrictions when it comes to space travel, like rarely being in zero gravity. I mean even astronauts have to whistle if they go into space due to the restrictions of their spacesuit, but they can whistle while in space, rarely. That's a pretty interesting fact, and I think gets me excited about Space exploration even more!
Space is also a neat fact, it harnass the water vapor from it and eliminate drought on Earth, I think we could eliminate drought there,
I think it's neat that the scientists are studying it too.  If we could harness the electricity from a thunder strike, it could power the entire earth for just a few minutes.  I wonder if that could have an effect if it were applied to thunder.  It can actually power the whole planet for a few seconds and then be gone in only a few more minutes.
That is an amazing creation.  I wish we could drop pods to deploy all over the earth.  It could have humanitarian impacts and even practical applications with its humanitarian impacts.
Agreed. It seems the concept of space offered in schools is not always used.
It would be awesome to offer a stem class in the mechanics of space engineering.  There are so many intricate things that people want to know about.
Yeah, I think there should be more stem classes like that. I hope to see more computer science being offered in the middle school, high school, and college. I know I took computer science in middle school and high school and then in college.
I think there should be a push for stem activites in younger people.  It is great to be able to learn about it and learn about its practical applications.
Yeah, I highly encourage teens to watch Marvel movies like Thor, Thor sparks creativity in children, but if they read the comics they can still read it, I think they can read the Comics too.
 creativity is seen through the lens of using the worlds problems through a lens of looking at them through the eyes of scientists. It is life and out of the box solutions to the worlds Problems.
I think that's why I like movies. I can be completely absorbed in them. Do you know much about the universe? I know that there are planets in the universe and there is life out of all of them.
I think that creativity is what gives us access to so much in everyday life.  I wonder if the left brain connections are still there and we are just not getting access to it through our left brain connection, or if we are using it in our everyday life?
Yeah, it is very stimulating. They actually had to improvise a dialogue in Thor that was really stimulating to me. Haha.
The creative spirit of the Ravens is amazing. It shows high levels of the creative spirit that they were able to tie these films together.  It's like a gauntlet.
Yes it is.  It really flows perfectly.  They layout the foundation for the story in different phases, so it flows perfectly through all the different phases.
I am sure the details are a little muddled but I think that's ok.  The bloggers are having a field day picking the movies.  They can have a fieldday pick the movies they want.
Haha, well I would be impressedsed, how about you?
Marvel studios has really poured a lot of money into Marvel Studios, so that must be hard.  I like that they are trying to get the quality of work and the shows to be as best as possible.
Disney's purchase of Marvel was a great fit for them, in my opinion.
Definately a smart money move on their part,
Hi there! Have you watched Thor: The Last Avenger? I think I saw the movie, but the authenticity is disputed because the gauntlet is shown briefly during Thor and it is right-handed in comics but not left-handed, but gauntlet isn't shown briefly in the movie because the authenticity of the g Gauntlet is disputed.
I have and I think it's one of my favorite Marvel movies! I really liked the casting of Chris Hemsworth as Thor, he did a great job.
Absolutely!  Tom Hiddleston had the perfect role.  He screen tested for the role of Loki, and he plays him in avengers: the avengers.  When Thor was screen tested, he had gained about 10 pounds from a strict diet and decided to go for muscle.  Loki, who has no weight, plays the role as he gained 20 pounds from the strict diet.
I knew he gained that much muscle but 50 pounds?  That's crazy but Hiddleston is a great Loki!  I think he's going to be a greatoki!
Yeah he is. Ant man made his marvel debut before Spider-man, Hulk, Thor and Iron-Man, but ant man made  his marvel debuted before Spiderman.
Hmm, I wonder if Hugin and Munin are in the next avenger film?
Taika Waititi, who did the dialogue in Thor: Ragnarok was improvised.  In order to create a loose and collaborate mood in the previous films, much of the dialogue, such as the birds and the dialogue between them in Ragnarok was improvised, in order to creating a different mood.
Nice, they did a great job improvising the scenes.
Yeah they did. Did you know there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.
that is crazy, and there are 7 million species of animals on earth!
That's a lot. Sounds like a lot! Animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated. I wonder why animals develop white patch when they're domesticated?
That is cool.  The loch ness monster is a protected species in Scotland.
That is freaking awesome. I didn't know that! In 2002 Germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.
I wonder if they include all the animals in there.  There are some that are only size 10 millionths of a metre, and that does not include those that are 1 metre in size.
No clue lol I don't know if that would give you too much detail.
I think it's crazy that there are over 1 million species of insects and that fly swatters are illegal in Germany.  I wonder why?  I know that flySwatter's are illegal there, but there are also over 1.5 million species in the US.
Haha I'm not sure. Hiccups are a holdover from early evolutionWhen early land animals had both gills and lungs, we have hiccups.
Wow, I never knew that! I wonder why? There is a water vapor cloud in space that has a trillion times the amount of water on Earth and is 1 trillion times that of the water vaporcloud in space.
That is amazing.  General motors are also amazing!  Did you know they used to give the Mercury and Apollo series astronauts a free corvette when they returned from space?
That is very nice of them.  Did you know that the USMC are researching using drop pods from space?
Awesome. Well its been great talking to you, thank you so much.
Hey there! Are you a fan of Thor the movie?
I haven't seen the movie, but I heard about it from my son who is a fan.
I don't really watch any superhero movies, but there have been some great movies from the late 80's and 90's produced by Marvel Studios, which owns Marvel Comics.
I do, I like the superman and batman movies.
I like both characters.  I wonder how they compared to each other.
I like how they defeated evil, I watched them when I was young, who is your fav superhero?
My favorite super hero is probably spaceman.  I like how a lot of people don't realize the world isn't as good as they think it is.  They acted like superheros and didn't realize that the world is not as good, but it has flaws.  In my opinion, spaceman is the best.  He's not a big fan of superheos, but he's a good one in my opinion.  Who is your favorite superhero?
I do like space! I read an article that it was Tom Hiddleston who prepared for the role of Thor in the new fiction. I wonder how he felt about that.  It's actually Tom Hiddingleston Who prepared for it.
Non-fiction.  I think real life outer space, to be honest.  It's amazing to see.  Real life outer SPACE!  It hurts my head to be so far away.
Apparently, astronauts that are outside the spacesuit cannot whistle.
I heard that too. The usmc is also trying to develop drop pods to deploy on the earth from outerspace. That is nuts!
I had heard that.  Who is funding the project?
I think it is huge. Funding is constantly being cut from NASA. We will never get space like that again.
It would be nice to continue space programs.  If they didn't have funding they would give free corvettes to apollo and mercury astronauts when they returned to earth after they returned.  That would be a nice way to give free Corvettes.
That is pretty cool.  I wonder how an astronaut feels about going up and seeing Earth from afar.  It can be life changing for sure, and life changing as well.
I wrote books about some of those experiences and they are not available for talk in private.  Apparently, they can only talk in public.  Astronauts don't talk inPrivate because they can't touch helmets or do a space walk.
Wow! That is neat! So fascinating! It's nuts to think that a water vapor cloud in space is a trillion times the amount of water on earth, and we have only 1 trillion times that!  That's nuts!  I mean, a water Vapor cloud in a space is 1 trillion Times the amount that's on earth.
It is fascinating indeed, space related facts often fascinate me!
I think the concept of space is considered to have a fundamental importance for understanding the physical universe. I didn't realize that humans are only the 2nd most important beings, but ants, which are bigger than us! Crazy, but you can picture it, the concept and the picture.
I don't think so, but disagreements continues between philosophers over the universe and what we know about the universe, do you?
True, I guess.  Great talking with you, have a good one.
Nice chatting with you too!
Thanks, I hope you have a good rest of your evening, in the depths of space, and I hope that you have an good rest.
I'll read more about space next!  Have a nice evening!  Bye!
You too, take care and enjoy the rest of the week.
Hey did you see the movie Gotti? It apparently was failure.  The critics were so surprised that it did not do better than John Travolta and the other "John Gotti" movie, but the movie was so good, the critics didn't like it, apparently was Failure 2.
I didn't see it, but I know it got horrible 5.5 reviews on rotten tomatoes. I wonder how well some other reviews did pan out.
Hmmm, I thought it would be better. It only had a 38 percent on rotten tomatoes.
I do use rotten tomatoes but I have seen that it has an abnormally high number of ratings, like 100 percent score.  It seems like a lot of the movies have been faked, or have ideas that have an abnormality high numberof ratings.
I guess audience and the critics scores are different, but I guess audience is more widely available than critics scores, which is interesting. But yeah, I read that the trolls, or trolls, were the people who made Gotti comparing it to the people that faked it.
I do read the audience scores. I tend to go pretty easy-going on movie choices. I think critics scores a bit more than audience scores, though, because I'm pretty easy -going onMovie choices myself.
I saw that Incredibles 2 opened the same weekend as Gotti, and Incredible 1.
I did, I heard it was a great animated flick by Pixar, what about you?
Yes, I loved it.  My favorite character is Edna Mode.  She is the lady from the director Brad Bird.  I find that her character was voiced by the director.  Another favorite character was Edna, the lady who is the first lady.
I love Samuel Jackson, I understand he played Frozone in that movie.
Yeah, I love Samuel L Jackson.  He's one of my favorites and I love that he's such a big box office draw.  I heard Tom Hanks is another big box star.  Did you know he's the highest all-time box office Draw at the box office?
I love Tom Hanks too! I found it curious that the Lord of the Rings movies had huge losses despite their success. The other Lord of The Rings movies have been a huge success, but I found that the losses were not as much as the profits.
Wow, that's pretty surprising. I figure that's why Disney was able to bring in so much money huh? I wonder why? I also heard that Disney has done animated animated hits like Treasure Planet and also hit the box office all the time, but I heard that was one of the most expensive at the boxoffice of all time, that is pretty surprising! I wonder what they did to bring down the money? Maybe it was like treasure planet didn't hit the right money, wow.
I wonder why it was a flop. John Carter was a box office hit. It broke box office records in Russia.
I loved John Carter.  I know that the movie was one of the few blockbusters that did well there.  Rotten Tomatoes's average rating for a film is 38% - that means that Michael Bay movies with a 100% rating are "Rotten"  I don't know how that's possible.
I don't like him either.  Ashton Kutcher does not have a fresh rating for a single movie he has been in.  He doesn't have afresh rating on any single movie.
Netflix is what makes him who he is, his movies are generally success, so I think it works for him, Netflix and his movies have a generally success. Rotten Tomatoes ratings always matter, though.
I know right,  I wonder if there are fake reviews to get the 100 percent rating or something like that.  Do they use fake reviews?
Yeah and all kinds brings us back to Gotti, that director, Kevin Connolly is pretty sure that he faked that 100 rating because he is the director, but yeah, all kinds
I think so as well, it only has a 93% rating on IMDB and I think it was horrible.
I wonder why it had that rating when it came out. Did you know it was given a 5.1 rating from the police academy?
The original Police Academy was good, but the new one is going downhill fast.
Good afternoon!  How are you today?
I'm doing great!  Have you heard of the movie Gotti?  Have You heard of it?
Good lord!  Yes, I have.  It's got a whopping 100% on rotten tomatoes from the good lord!
That is great!  Do you know who John Travolta is?
I find that hard to believe since it was completely slammed by critics and his marketing company claimed audiences loved it.  I know that his marketingcompany claimed audiences were not really loved it, but I find it hard to see how it was slammed byCritics.
I wonder if the audiences were the only ones who liked it, it mentions Gotti's son gave it a "C"
Man is biased!  How so?
It eludes me that the fact that he would have gotten fake reviews on Rotten Tomatoes is even true but that is a fact that still eludes him.  Do you believe in fake reviews?
I dont really know, I dont think its possible, but I can see people trolling on the internet.  I defintiely think that the tomato score is being generated by aggregating reviews form top critics and the reviews form Top Critics on the Internet.
Yeah.  It sits there, just sits there.  I know that I will watch it after the fact, but I think it will be painful.
I would if it was funny, or out of morbid curiosity.  It is not.  Trainwreck is a trainwreck.
I hate to admit it but I've seen terrible movies before that were really terrible. I would have to say that this show is right up my alley lol. I used to watch the Gotti family reality tv show years ago, I hate to say years ago but that was a terrible movie. Did you watch the gotti family family reality TV show?
Michael Bays stuff is pretty bad too, but hie has been in some terrible movies,a ccoridng of "Rotton, TX".  I think he has done some terrible films before.  I have seen tomatoes.  Michael Bays is an average guy but he's done some really terrible movies.  Some of hie best films were terrible movies and some of Michael B Bay's stuff isPretty bad.
Haha I wonder if he has a fresh rating, or just rotten tomatoes or just a freshRating
I'm not sure.  I know it's widely considered to be a good movie if it has a fresh rating of 100% or above, but that is the highest that a movie can get.  The only category that a "fresh rating" does not mean is video game movies, which is the only category in which it is not widely considered a goodmovie
Wow. and apparently ashton kutcher's movies are not that great, have you seen any of his movies?
Not much, I think he is average.
I think they list his average as a fresh rating which means he has seen every single movie with a 100% fresh rating.
Oh man, that's sad! Do you like any of his movies?
I have seen a couple of his movies, they were alright but I don't recall the name of the couple that he was in.  I do know he was on That 70s Show and I liked him in that.
I didn't enjoy that 70s show, not my cup of tea, I like him better now, hes on shark tank, I don't like that show, I know hes on Shark Tank, I really like him.
Hi! Have you seen the latest John Gotti movie with John Travolta?
No, but I'm excited to see it! I can't believe it has a 93% rating on rotten tomatoes!
Do you like Armand Assante? I saw his version of "Travolta" a few times.
True, it has been done so many times and many times it has gotten some harsh assessments from the critics.
Yeah most times I ignore them, I know the audience is already owned by Warner Brothers, so yeah most times i ignore them.
The marketing team for Gotti did a good job at the time, turning a really bad situation into the worst mob movie of all time, but I think they should gather a greater following, they did a really good job in turning it into the best mob movie. I wonder how the marketing team did?
I wonder if Netflix is able to score some of those movies.  I know that Netflix has quite a score.
I think that is about right.  I think they do a good job of rating its movies.  Rotten tomatoes is on IMDB all the time.  They do a really good job.
Hey you remember Siskel, Ebert, you?
I do. What movie do you think they were in?
Yes, it's pretty cool. It's an original rotten tomatoes where they review movies with clips from the movies on Sundays. They review movies on the original rotten tomato.
I heard they got a fresh rating on rotten tomatoes. Ebert, Siskel, and Ebert.  Spykids got a 99% fresh rating.  I wonder why?
I saw that there was a sequel to the video game called the incredibles raise the incredibilibles 2, the sequel comes out in two years, and the incredables raise the value of an underminer in the video games.
Speaking of incredibles, too bad theres a film based on video games, and speaking of incredible raise of the underminer, is that film based off of the incredibles raise of a underminer?
I have, I enjoyed it, it was very funny, set in a pretty good time period.
Yes, I enjoyed Incredibles 2, one of the sequels to the first, created by Walt Disney.  I think they did a good job with the sequels, I really enjoyed IncREDIENTS!
Apparently disney thought about closing their animation studio because sleeping beauty was so bad, apparently disney said they would have to close their animationStudio because sleeping Beauty was so terrible
That is weird that Sleeping Beauty is so iconic and it is still so bad at the box office, today. I think it's because they had an experience with Treasure Planet, which was really bad at that box office.
I didn't realize that Tom Hanks was in toy story, Mighty Dollar, which was one of the highest movie earnings of all time.  It earned over $270 million.  That was before the mighty dollar and after toy story.
I think it is. He's a good actor but not a star capable of carrying a movie to an amazing degree. I wonder if that's why Trojan was a flop at the box office. It earned $309 dollars but only earned $1.5 million. That's not a movie that would pay off to a good extent, but it was an amazing show of will to pay the money even though it didn't budge, and it was a box office flop. I think that's what it takes to be a star, to be able to be the star capable.
15 million?  That is nothing but a hit.  Silence of the lamb is a hit but it was a doge a bullet.  It goes hand in hand with anthony hopkins "The Doge" which got a $15 million.
I concur! In any case, this has been a wonderful opportunity to chat about movies with you.
Hey how are you? Have you ever seen Rotten Tomatoes? I heard it's a movie about how Gotti got a Rotten THey, have you heard of the movie?
I never understood the rotten tomatoes rating, and I guess I never really understood the Rotten Tomatoes rating either.  I think a better rating is good, but I guess it has to have better ratings from critics to have a higher rating.
I didn't know that either.  It is usually the 10 percent of critics who recommend the film or the five percent of Critics who recommend it.  I believe that only 5 of the critics have recommended it so far.
I wonder why they would, surely not because supposedly all the fan ratings are fake.
Well, marketing can do that to you.  marketing can really make you look right and critics wrong, and make you believe that it is well received by audiences.
They want to prove the critics wrong, and the fans want to see something that can prove theCritics wrong.
True.  Rotten tomatoes is owned by Warner brothers, so it's possible that it's true that it could be.  Did you know that Rotten Tomatometer is ownedby Warner brothers?
I had no idea but I do like Rotten Tomatoes, I wonder if they have fresh ones or they just do fresh ones?
I think it's when a movie is recommended by 10 percent of critics who support the film, but not fresh.  I wonder if that has something to do with bias since they are owned by a major studio and have to be recommended by at least 40 percent of the critics who Support it.
I agree.  I think the studio does what it wants with the people who are going to like the studio and not vice versa.
That would be interesting to study.  How did their films fare there versus their biggest competitors?  And how their films fares there versus independent films.
It would be.  WB Bros movies have a rating of 38% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is better than the Toy Story movies, which have a 38% rating.
Bias is not always subtle, like in Spy Kids.  It's not subtle.
I loved that movie, Spykids. I think it was called that because all the superhero kids in high school were in that movie.
I have not seen that. Disney almost shut down their animation studios after sleeping beauty did so poorly at the box office.
Did you know that there was a movie where the little girl from the Sleeping Beauty used only paper dolls and the girl from that movie did not even know it?
Yeah, Disney has had its ups and downs.  Treasure Planet was one of the most expensive box office failures of all time but I think it was better than The Little Mermaid which was another Disney "failure".  I think Treasure Planet had one of our best box office ups and one of their best failures of the all time.
I wonder what it's like to be a muppet movie, then.  Disney is known for their box office home runs, like Treasure Island, Pirates of the Caribbean series and the Muppet movie "Pirates of the Muppets" are some of their box Office home runs.
I find it comforting that they have had a lot of success and also failures. There are so many ups and downs, but I find it's comforting that there are so much failures.
Disney is taking over the world. It makes me wonder what they'll do with all the star wars movies that are available. I think Disney is taking it all over the globe.
Yes, they do. Well, it was good talking with you. Have a good night!
You have a great night as well, and happy new year!
Happy New Year to you too!
Hi, did you know that the universe could be a hologram?
I did not! That is an interesting theory!
Elon Musk is a pretty smart one
Yeah, he does seem really smart. I guess he believes in a theory that there is only one electron in the universe so maybe he is right, maybe there is just one electron and we just don't know I guess.
Hmm I have never heard that before. That is strange to think about. I also didn't know that Kim jong Un has a degree in physics. Haha.
Holy cow!  That's interesting,  I wonder what it is about?
ya he is the supreme leader of the university and he was the first to pass away, I wonder if he was a supreme leader? haha
Yeah, maybe he gave it to himself lol. The emperor of Japan is a scientist too, he was a scientist.
No, what kind of scientist? What is his specialty?
Yeah I'm not sure, I guess Harrison Schmitt is the scientist that walked on the moon, he was the only scientist that did.
That is insane, and weird that there are only two astronauts that have a phd in their age, and the Wolfram Alpha creator is also considered scientists, that is insane
Holy smokes, that is insane. Crazy how smart some people can be!
I honestly wonder if it's genetic, parenting, or a bit of both.
Yeah, genetics at work. Did you know that the internet was created by a scientist?
haha I would not have guessed that, I did not know that, but I know that gore claimed to have created the internet and I believe him, I don't think hes a scientist, I think his story is different, and that is how gore claimed that he created theinternet, haha
Yeah, I thought that rumor was hilarious.  I don't think so.  He's working at the CERN I guess.
lol, I guess that didn't really happen though.  Speaking of smart people, did you know that John von Neumann could not speak ancient Greek because his parents didn't want him to learn it.  He was involved with the CERN, and his parents were not smart people.  I guess he didn't learn it until he was 15.  LOL
Yeah that is crazy, I wonder if his parents were just working overtime, that's crazy!
On the other hand he grew up to be a genius!
Yeah, he was a bum when he was older lol.
I wonder what kind of papers Trump would publish. He's not a scientist haha, but the emperor of Japan was a scientist, publishing papers like the emperor. I wonder what kinds of papers trump would publish
Geez, that would be pretty bad.  Well, it was nice talking with you today.  Hope you enjoy the weekend.
Hello, how are you?
Great, thanks!  What do you think about Stephen Hawking and his beliefs about God?
He was brilliant, worth knowing. I think that ideologies can be different but some ideologies are just not worth knowing
I think he is brilliant, he has some interesting theories and facts about the universe, the universe and his ideas about God and church, I tend to agree with his ideas, he is definitely interesting theories.
I do not know how atheism is related to science but I do think it's possible, there is a larger universe,
I have the question as to his beliefs, too bad he died altough he was only age 85 and had a condition Im suprised he made it that far, he did like to read and learn I wonder how old he was and what his condition im suprising he made so much from his beliefs.
I agree. I am shocked he made it that long. I took a ton of science classes in college and started questioning myself when I read his books. I think I was about the same way when I started questioning my head in a ton, but I'm shocked he still made it this long.
Yea, I read the Theory Of Everything, that is a great book but hard to understand, hard to follow, I also read The Theory Of Nothing, another great book But hard tofollow
I read it once but it made me feel bad about the history of time and such so I never read it again.
That's pretty long indeed lol, I guess the title can be summarized as being summarized as how big the universe is.  It would take an enormous book to document it all up to date and I would think it would be pretty long.  I guess it's just a way to show how big of a world we have and how big The universe is, but I guess there is no book to documents it all,  so it will have to be a book to Document it all for us.
I think I would have trouble reading it if I had to force myself to read it carefully and concentrate. I would definitely have trouble if I was reading it upside down. I have a book about organic chemistry, but that's a force.
I finished it and read some pages but I'm not quite finished. I know scientists say that universes also evolve through natural selection.
I did not know that. I thought that was so weird, like maybe a giant superhologram.
I guess its a valid theory, but I don't think space and the superhologram are the only two, maybe space is a superhologicalram
Yes it is possible. Did you know that there is only 1 electron in the universe?
I guess that is just physics.  Physics is a good thing.  It answers many of the questions that we have about everything.  We can answer some question by applying it to something.
Yes, and a physicist is Kim Jong-un, who has been shot twice.
I agree, and I think he lies a lot, he has a false degree on physics, so maybe he lies on a falsedegree
I agree, I wonder what his professors think about that, if his degree is actually legit, he can't fail, he has to have a degree and his professors would never know, he must be legit, what do you think?
No, he doesn't have a lot of options there lol.  I wonder if the theory that states that there is only one universe is actually true.  There is a theory that says there are more than one universe.
Nice chatting with you. Thanks!
Hello, do you like science?
Yes, I do. Did you know Hawkings was an intelligent man?
I do too.  He didn't believe in God, but he did believe that he could exist.  I don't know if I would come to such conclusions if I didn't know that there was a God.
Man had a great intelligence and understanding of the universe.  He spoke to the popes and other religious leaders.  I think he spoke with a great intellig and understanding about the universe and the universe as a whole.
I admired Hawkins as a great scientist and I am curious as to what Lou Gehrig's disease is.  I know it is a hard disease to get and I really admired Hawkins and he was the first to know about this disease, I think its curious, he was also a scientist.
Yes, and he persevered in spite of that illness. I think he also believed that there are stars in the universe that no human could touch because they are cold and there are some stars that are so far away that no humans could touch them.
I had no idea. I love to learn new things about the universe. I know there are many planets and many galaxies and many stars. I would love to learned more about all the stars.
I've always loved physics, there is so much to learn about how the universe behaves and how we understand our world.
It really does, I was so surprised to learn that Pixar spent 3 years studying physics of curly hair!
Wow, 3 years is a lot of information to study, I wonder why they did that.  I also saw that Kim Jong-Un has a degree in physics, he had a degree for 2 years,  that's a lot  of information!
No I did not know that. I do find the objective of studying physics really interesting. I don't understand how the universe behaves, but I do understand how it is. I find the objectives of studying Physics really interesting
Absolutely.  We can learn so many things from the universe.  Like scientists at Harvard stored the ending of the universe in the DNA of bacteria.  I read that.  Did you know that?  Scientists used it as a gif animation of a galloping horse to imagine the universe ending.  LOL.
That is great!  I think it is impressive things to do. Harrison Schmitt is the only one who walked on the moon.
That was a magnificent experience! Jon von Neumann could divide by a 4 digit numbers by the age of 4 and then in his ancient Greek head of talk could do the same thing with 3 digit numbers in just 2.5 seconds. Amazing... and he was only 18!  Talk about an ancient and magnificent experience.
It is amazing.  I also think it is amazing how much the world wide web is a great invention by scientists and has greatly affected our lives, it is agreat invention by us and it has greatly effected our lives.
Yes, it has.  I think scientists are so intelligent, they have affected so many parts of our lives in so many ways.  The creator of Wolfram Alpha has a phd, so the creator of wolfram alpha is very intelligent.  He's in his age for sure.  And he was one of the first scientists to have a Phd.
That is interesting!  I also like Natural Philosophy.  The term started in the 17th century.  Did you know this?
I know things have changed and advanced over the years, there are so many things to learn about the world, we only learned a small amount but we have learned about physics in the last few years, we learned a big amount and many things have been learned about Physics.
I'm interested in learning more about the ancient disciplines from the beginning. My favorite part of physics is astronomy, one of the most ancient disciplines I am interested inlearning.
Astrophysics is a fascinating topic, I will never stop learning and growing, we live in an amazing world and it is a amazing world, we should never stop Learning!
Nice talking with you!  Thanks!
Are you a Beatles fan?
Yes, I am! I like all the incredible stuff they did. I like John especially.
He was one of the real musical pioneers.
Absolutely, and Geoff Emerick was the sound engineer!
Yeah, sound engineering is one of the neat things about him. He really redefined what it meant to be a sound engineer. He's done some neat things
Yeah, I heard the work of the Revolver, did you know that?
I have, it is amazing, sweet, I like the band, but I don't read music, do you?
Yeah, and they did it all through art.
 Genius stands the test of time and I think so too.  Did you know the Beatles had one of the best selling albums of 2014?
Yep, the word love has been used so many times.
613 words/ lyrics? That's like one album, or a life in one album. They are largely regarded as the most influential band in the history of the lyrics of the songs. "Baby came straight from the Meet the Beatles" is one of their songs.
They are American! Paul even composes classical music which is impressive.
Cool! I never thought about it, but Ringo was the narrator of the Thomas the Tank Engine TV show and I thought that was so cool! I learned that Ringo, amazingly, was illiterate throughout most of his childhood due to illness. He missed years of schooling and was unable to watch Thomas the tank engine, so he was the narration! I thought it was very inspirational. He also learned to ride his horse in the show.
Yeah that's pretty impressive.  I grew up watching that show.  That is so impressive!
Me too.  I remember when they would stop touring.  The Beatles were so popular in the 1960s they had to stop touring, but I remember that they were so loud!  The screams of the fans were so Loud!
Yeah they really got popular with Beatlemania,
I forgot about that!  I know I was like a little wild.  I wonder if that's because of the mania over the latest fad music or if it was the way classical music was.  Classical music had loud, moving audiences during performances.  It wasn't uncommon back in the day to have moving and moving audiences.  Not uncommon for the day.
I wonder if it was like that for popular music in the time of the movie Armadeus, it was the most popular music of all time.
Yeah, I have seen it.  I think it's amazing that so many music fans today still are obsessed with classical music today.  Arthur Lintgen, the dude who can identify a piece of classical music simply by the grooves in the vinyl record, is an amazing dude.
That is fascinating! Classical music is so fascinating to me too. It is said to decrease crime in cities around the world!
Yeah, they're even trying to curb teen loitering in shopping centers. Hey, it was nice chatting with you!
Good afternoon!  Did you hear about John Lennon wanting to sound like the dalai lama?
Yeah. I think the Beatles were always going through phase when it came to that stuff. Harrison is still stuck in that phase though.
I didn't realize the Beatles had been around since the 50s.
I read music has been around since hamburg, but yeah I think they count their time in Europe.
I didn't know that Ringo Star was illiterate either. I wonder how that came about? Is it from childhood or something?
Hmm, I guess he was not into rhythm.  I've heard that the rotating Leslie speaker was a thing.  It was by Emerick.  The one that has the rotating leslie speaker and a rhythm?
I have never heard of that before.  I read they stopped touring bc current amplification technology doesn't allow for the screaming they used.
Yeah, those girls are really loud and way too loud. I was surprised to learn that emerick worked with elvis costello, one of my favorites and also surprised to know that emeric worked with Elvis Costello!
Do you use the internet a lot? In 1936, the russians built a computer that ran on water.
I do, it seems impossible but then again philosophy says so, I am not an engineer and that is impossible.
That is such a good quote!  Did you know smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty?
Yes, I did.  I heard it was a Beatles song.  Did you know that a Beatles track was used in Timothy Leary's ca governor campaign in 1964.
That's pretty cool. I wonder if he won, I wonder how he won?
He did, but it was because of the qualification, he had to get the LSD.  No computers at all, I wonder how that was possible.
I am.  I read the space shuttles general purpose computers runs on 1mb of ram.
Yeah I wonder what the results of that are. I bet they do not smoke near the voting.
Ha! That's funny! Did you know that a building can be built from mine craft building blocks?
I have not but I would like to take a pic.  I like classical music.  There is a shopping center in Australia that has to have classical music because of teenagers that are loitering in the shopping center.
That's really cool.  Cities are using music to deter crime.  I think that is a great way to do it.
that is cool, a computer actually composed a piece of classical music in 1989
That is so cool! I have heard audiences get loud at some classical concerts! It was so nice chatting with you!
Are you a fan of the Beatles?
I am not, but I do like the Beatles.
I'm a fan. They have been around for as long as I can. It is 50 years next year and they formed in Liverpool in 1968.
Yeah it is, I feel old lol.  I can understand that because I don't feel old either.  It seems like they have evolved so much over the years and I'm sad that they are going to break up after 60 years.
Amazingly the Beatles has the best selling album, pretty amazing, but I think it takes a certain kind of fan power to have a selling album that well, and amazingly the Beatles had that kind of power.
They wrote the classic songs that influenced many other musicians. They dont have to hit it big now.  I dont know if they wrote theclassic songs that inspired other artists.
 Timothy Leary was on one of the good songs from their California governor campaign, but I'm not sure.  I believe the Beatles wrote many of them.  Did you know that the Beatleswrote a few for the California Governor campaign?
Oh, Timothy Leary? I never knew that! I guess he needed a song! That's a cool song. I wonder why they did it. Wasn't he a LSD guy? I guess it was to help him out.
I'm surprised he wasn't heavy into politics, he was. Ringo was illiterate for most of his childhood and only missed 2 years of school due to tuberculosis and peritonitis. John, like John, missed 4 years ofSchool due toculosis and peritoneitis.
That is so amazing. I am surprised he didnt die from that. I listen to music all the time so I am also surprised hent die from it.
I am not sure but I know the beatles stopped touring in 1972 when amplification technology had not yet come along with the screaming.  I wonder what time they would have been able to do so.  They were already old when the Beatles stopped touring and used amplification technology.
I think the fans were fanatics.  If you can hear screaming you can definitely hear the music.  I would rather hear theMusic.  There are so many albums that are worth seeing.  Do you listen to them?
I know right.  Interesting fact is that the Beatles could read music and even toured in the states.  I wonder how many of the Beatles can read music.
They learned to play by ear. I think that is typical of rock and pop musicians.
I've heard that. A lot of musicians use computers now. There's something interesting about computers.
I know the russians built a computer powered by water back in 1936, I wonder why?
I wonder how that worked,  using water to generate a power source?  I mean they had computers back then. lol
I had no idea they had mechanical computers! They built one in minecraft and I wonder how they built it.
That's crazy!  I wonder how that worked? lol  The space shuttles general purpose computer ran on 1 MB of ram.  That's so little.  lol  I've had fun chatting with you!
 programmers must have used that ram carefully.  It's been fun chatting as well.
Have a good day!  Thanks.
Good Morning, are you a fan of the Beatles?  Are you a good morning!  They had the best selling album in 1964.
I expect to the Beatles are the best selling album of the 21st century so I expect that the Beatles have the best sells album of all time.
Yeah that's a good point I bet it will! Surprisingly, at one point I wonder if the Beatles could read music?
I wonder if that made a difference for the Beatles, they are known as the rocks musicians, reading music is something they learned by ear.  I wonder if it would have made a Difference for the other 3, if not the Beatles?
Yeah that's true, Ringo Starr was never able to read much in his childhood, he was illiterate from what I know of him.
He was illiterate? I wonder how he did so well? He was a good drummer, so he must be a good one.
Yeah it sounds like it.  He missed three years of school due to tuberculosis and peritonitis.
Wow, that is terrible, I'm glad he survived. I guess he developed an interest in music after that, hard to believe, but I guess so.
Yeah, it was interesting to hear their story, how they formed, how he met them, it would be interesting to learn more about how they all formed.
I guess they played in different clubs around the US like in Liverpool. I don't know if they did it in college or uni, or if it was just one club.
That's great.  That's a dream I would like to dream about!  It's cool that the Beatles experimented with different music styles ranging from pop and Indian music to hard rock.
I think that was the thing, they traveled so much, they explored so much new stuff and really explored every little thing they could.
Yeah that is a good point. The Beatles once literally stopped touring because current amplification technology was too old.  I don't think they were screaming "yeah!"
I think they wanted a Beatles experience and I know that listening to other fans would have been pointless. It is better to be the Beatles and just do what you want rather than listening to others.
Yeah it sounds super crazy. Speaking of the computer, did you know that you can watch a video of a basic Minecraft building using nothing but blocks of the same blocks on a computer. Yeah I would not go there for the comfort of my working computer, but yeah it sounds a bit crazy to me.
I'm amazed that it took them forever to build it, how did they even get it up?
Yeah, I can't imagine.  I am glad we aren't the only ones though. smoking near Apple computers voids the warranty by making it a biohazard, imagine if you smoke near them.  smoking near apple computers voided the warranty!
Me too! Do you vape or like vaping?
I can't. I do not know much about vaping.
lol, I don't vape anymore. I don'l vape. Anyway, great chat!
Yeah, that's not surprising. Industrial robots controlled by computers. Nice talking to you.
Do you have a Nintendo? I still remember in such detail how much of my childhood is watching my brother play the Legend of Zelda on my Nintendo. Did you ever play that game?
I did play that game, it was my favorite, I love Nintendo. I like playing Mario, I was playing Mario 3rd.
I like how they have been making them for a while now.  I guess the company was actually founded in the 18th century and was a card playing company back then.
Crazy, I had no idea!  My son plays on the handheld console I have and wears his favorite "Lucky Pokemon Go shirt lol"  He has a game that is made for the handheld consoles. I had to look up what the game was, I think it is a game from the 80s,  I had the idea,  it was like the old "Lotto" shirt lol
I like video games because they're fun. I enjoy going to Mariners game. I like that they have a app to order food from the app, meaning I don't have to go to the seat in the Mariners game to get it. I also like Nintendo and its fun to enjoy.
Oh wow, the Mariners? That's crazy and interesting! I know that Nintendo also produced Lego knock offs for the Mariners. My son likes to play the Pokemon Go. It's great fun to play. Did you know at one point Nintendo even produced Lego's? That is so crazy and Interesting!
I wonder how long that venture lasted?  Technology has evolved in the past few decades, so much so that it's crazy how far we've come in the over the past 20 years.  It takes more than 30 frames for a racing game to run through a racingGame, which was created in 1992.  I wonder how much technology has evolved and how long That venture lasted.
I bet that was fun, I like Nintendo, and technology is amazing, I bet there are games and other games that are pretty fast, do you play tennis? I used to play tennis, Nintendo was so fun
I think Wii Sports has tennis. I remember there was a mario tennis game, but I don't remember if the Wii Sports had it. Do you play tennis?
I do love tennis games. I don't play much but I do love Nintendo. I'll have to check out that game for the Wii. I think it's funny that one of the businesses Nintendo tried prior to the Wii was trying to check into how much they play. Haha.
Many businesses that become profitable and successful have similar stories.  Some of the largest and best-known video game companies in the world have had to learn how to pivot and find new businesses, and learn from the mistakes of the past to become profitable.  It's good to learn that some businesses have a way to pivot, and sometimes they are successful.
True.  It's huge now.  In 2018 they were valued at 104 billion dollars.  I guess with all the graphics that they do, Nintendo is very true.  They even have clothing lines too!  I like their clothes with brand name of shirts and shorts.  The clothes are huge and valued at $15 billion dollars!
Well, technically it's not clothing. It's the brand name of the parent company. So, they can be things, like mariners, which technically isn't a brand since its parent company is the Mariners.
True.  They do sell tee shirts and some polo shirts which I bet are the ones you wear in tennis.  Polo shirts are a huge market for U.S. made clothes.
It's funny how the polo shirts started with tennis players.  I mean, they were worn by polo players, but they're not really polo.  They're just used for deceiving you.
I heard that, pretty interesting.  The designer of polo shirts, Rene "the crocodile" Lacoste was actually a crocodile and not a designer of Polo shirts, I wonder why?
I heard that too.  Depending on where the collar tips fasten to the shirt the "button" can mean a different difference for the shirt and the button down button up, depending on where and how the collar ends and the collar tip is.
Haha, I never knew that.  One thing that I did know is that China's gang fashion involved layering as many shirts as possible and popping the collars.  Hmmm, that's funny because I never even knew that was possible!  I think that would be funny to try and put on!  They would probably just keep popping the Collars!
I would be a stranger in some of those photos! The official business attire in Hawaii is the aloha shirt - no stranger to me!
That is pretty cool, I love wearing shirts like that. Do you?
Billy May's funeral pallbearers wore khaki pants and blue shirts. I wonder if they were comfortable?
Do you watch tennis?  I don't really watch it.
Hello there, yes I do like tennis, especially when the Williams sisters are playing, what about you?
Yeah, they are great! I wonder if there is any relation between tennis and polo shirts.
Yes I did, polo shirts were invented for tennis players.
Yeah I do too, I think it was Rene Lacoste the tennis player.
A black man won the first US tennis open title in 1968, but no black man has won the US tennis Open title since.
Yeah, a sad thing that he did not get to be there.  I think he won it in 1968.
True.  Back to Tiger Woods, I have to remind myself Tiger Woods was a black man.
Yeah he was.  They once used a helicopter to dry a tennis court once.
Wow, I'm not surprised that game was once postponed, it's an important and valuable game.
Yeah true. Do you know the longest match in tennis?
Yes the longest tennis match was 11 hours over 3 days.  That takes a lot of energy from each player.
That's true, but I don't know if that's true of the video games.
I'm not surprised that Nintendo is one of the world's largest video game companies by market capitalization. I'm surprised that they are not one of two largest video games companies byMarket capitalization though.
Yeah, and they were founded in 1903. They've been around for over 100 years now!
Did you know Nintendo release handheld console for Pokemon and the Seattle Mariners?
No, no I didn't know that. They also own a toy company and created a lego knock-off
I heard that!  One of my favorite shirts of the teens are the arrow shirt collar.
I have heard that, I think polo shirts were invented because of that.
I do not know. I know polo shirts were invented in the 1700s, but short details like that. Why do you think poloshirts were invented?
It was invented by a tennis player in the 1800's, Rene Lacoste, nice chat
Hi, how are you this morning?
I'm great, how bout you.  You?
I am good! How are you? Do you like tennis?
I have never sat down to watch it to be honest, but I like to watch when I can.
I watch it when someone is playing, but I did not realize a black man has never won the US Open tennis title, he won it in 1968.
That is crazy! I can't believe it!
Yeah, especially with Serena and her sister Venus dominating on the women's side, I wonder if a black man would represent US on the Women's side?  I wonder how a blackMan would represent us.
Huh, I guess not. Do you like tennis? I like to grunt when I have to leg it with my leg when I do tennis.
Apparently, lol!  I learned recently that polp shirts were originally invented for tennis!  Apparently, I learned recent that Polo shirts were actually invented for baseball!
I didnt know that, do you ever play table tennis?
I played it when I was a kid.  I was actually pretty good,  picked it quick.
I dont know if I would ever be good with a ball. I would learn to put that side English on the ball. LOL.
Very true! Have you ever played Nintendo?
I did when I was a kid!  I used to love it all the time.  I really liked mario the most.
I didn't realize they started as a playing card company way back in 1889, I think.
That is a long time age! A long way huh. The NES had online gameplay capabilities before the PS came out.
Yes and it is the most valuable company in Japan, with a market value of over $8.5 billion. I wonder if it is a valuable company here.
Wow. that is amazing! that is a lot of money.
The Seattle Mariners have a Nintendo. They have been around since the 90's.
I did not know that, but that is cool.  I guess it's true how big of baseball fans the Japanese people are, I guess.
I have visited Japan many times, they are crazy about baseball and video games.  Well, it has been nice chatting with you this morning, have a good day, friend!
Hi, have you played Nintendo games before?  Video games were made before they were founded in the 80's.
I have.  Nintendo 64 was the first game to run at a fps of 3800 fps.  It was the F-zero, a racing game.
That's crazy. I like all the stuff Nintendo has done, video games, video game, cab services and love hotels.
I wonder if they ever made a lego knockoff? They have produced videogames for a great many videogame franchises and even made a Lego knockoff!
Yea I love mario, Pokemon, Zelda, Pokemon Go, Pokemon GO, great franchises, I like Zelda the best
Did you know the newest mario game is supposed to be really good?
Yea it's pretty good. Do you know the Seattle Mariners used to be on Nintendo?
I did not. That's crazy! I wonder if they have an app for ordering food from a seat in the seat or an app  for ordering it?
I didn't even know there were sports teams with 3d's. Nintendo owns the market now with a market value of $104 billion!
I'm not sure, they did release a console specifically for Pokemon.
Yes, I wonder if the original playing cards Nintendo made for it are still worth as much as the original Playing cards Nintendo used to make.
Probably not as much as the first made polo shirts, or some other items they came out with. They made polos in the 60s
I'm not sure but Nintendo did make mario tennis games, it's a crazy sport. The longest match went on for 11 hours and was for 11 hrs, pretty crazy!
I think there are some interesting tennis matches. A black man won the 1st US Open title in 1968.
That is odd.  A black man has never won the US Open before and now a black man is the only one who has won it
I know, right?  The year after his first victory in the US Open, they used a helicopter to dry the fields for him.
That is crazy polos were originally invented for rene lacoste, thats crazy
I know right!  Gangs in China used to layer polos and pop the collars.
Interesting! The pallbearers at Billy Mays' funeral wore blue shirts and khakis.
That is interesting! Do you ever wear buttoned shirts?
Nice chatting with you! I have to get going.
Hi, how are you?
I am well! How are you?
I'm good, thanks.
Are you a fan of superheroes?
I like superhero movies.  I don't know much about them though.  What about you?
Did you ever see any of the spider man movies?
I didn't watch the latest one.  Which was the most recent?
I like X-men but I've seen it a few times.  A teen injected himeslef with mercury in an attempt to convert his bones to metal in the first one.  I wonder how that went?
No I can't believe that.  That is crazy stuff!
Michael Jackson tried buying marvel but couldn't get it
The opening of the first spider man was performed by joe perry.
Wow! That's awesome! He was so good in that. I listen to the word brainiac often, it's a good one.
I remember a brainiac character in the superman comics when I was a kid, but I don't remember his name.
Did you know Superman from the DC comics only paid $130 dollars for the rights to superman?
That's not a great deal at all.
Marvel does great things for a kid with hearing aids, too.
No. What did they do?
Oh that's cool, I had one as a kid, but my mother did not like superheroes. Marvel created a superhero that could wear hearing aids, because Marvel created the first superhero to ever wear hearing aid and it was the only one to do so.
I think it is a cool thing to have.
Nice chatting with you! I have to get going.
Same to you. Have a good day!
Thanks! You too.  Have a good one.
Hello!  Do you like Marvel?
It's a fun company and I am happy with how the Walt Disney Company has handled things since acquiring them.
Me too!  Marvel started in 1933.
Yes, and they are called timely publications.
Cool stat. A boy who was deaf, created a superhero as a superhero because he was a boy.
I love when companies do things like that, that is such a nice thing to do.  Are you referring to blue ear?  I love when company's do things for others.
Yep that is a good thing, Blue ear is actually a good name, melts my heart hearing stories about it.
Did you know the marvel character spider-man was the first character who Sony tried to name after the Marvel character Spider-Man?
I love Spider man! I wonder how Sony is doing with it now.
I didn't know that either. They bought them for $15 million back in 2004 and they bought them again for $50 million in 2006!
Wow! That is a lot of money. The military wants to make a spider-man like abilities for soldiers in the military.
Hah, that would be epic!  Amazing Spiderman has had over 750 comic issues!
It was sad that Stan Lee passed away last year, he brought a lot of joy to the world and I'm sad that stan lee passed away, he had a lot to do with it.
Yes I was sad to hear of his passing.  He left a great legacy behind him.  I wonder if he received any of the net profits he received from the characters he created based on the characters since his passing, I think he only received like $500,000 in net profits, but he left agreat legacy behind
He did, what a legacy, that is so cool of him, do you ever read comic books?
I have in the past. I like marvel because it stands for detective comics.
I think it's cool that DC stands for DC.
Did you know Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection?
Hilarious. I am from Michigan, I drive through there every day. I would check that out!
Yeah, that's cool.  It's lovely.  They're valued at $104 billion dollars and have a huge market.  So, talk to me today!
I think so too. It was good chatting with you today too.
Hi, do you like Marvel?
I'm good this morning. Yeah I like Marvel a little. My son and I are watching superhero movies now, Marvel and DC.
Nice, I am a huge Fantastic Four fan.  I think the first movie killed me.  The second movie killed it.
Yeah,  I havnt seen it either.  I like comic books.  Isnt it because of the age of the comic books?
That makes sense, Sony turned down $1B to spend on a spiderman 3, it would have been a great choice but Siderman is making some money, he spent $75M on the rights to marvel characthers, I think that was a great decision, I wish Sony turned it down, Spiderman is one of the best marvel characters.
Marvel was not big on Spiderman.  I personally think that X-Men was a lot better show.  It makes a lot more money and wouldnt have hurt Disney's wallet.  They wouldnt throw in a $20 million deal for the X-men,  and Marvel wouldnt be able to throw in $30 million for a new show. I think that would have hurt Disneys wallet,  they have enough money already.
Yeah, I love X-men too, its my favorite of all the cartoons, I still have old dvds and I throw them in the dish every month and they are nostolgic like the old dvd's, throw in some new ones every month. I love x-men.
I really like Wolverine. I think he's the best. He's a real dude. He tells a story.
Yeah, he is one of my favorites. I felt bad for him because he has the powers to be a night crawler, I felt like he was the only one with powers.
I think it's crazy that they pick on power, like professor Xaviors, to read and control minds like that!
Yeah that would be nice. Marvel has a characther that is named Access, it is owned by a company named Access.
I didnt know that, I wonder why?
He was trying to stop the two universes from becomming the same, and his job was to look corny with blue costume and red piping, to stop it from looking corny.
Huh, yeah,  I dont think I have seen Spider Man on TV much.  But,  he is so popular,  SSO much,  in the world,  huh?
Well I've heard that a lot of the companies have done their own spin off versions, I heard there are a lot that are tough to watch, I think that's why Andrew Garfield did not want to do the "spin off" versions.
3 companies huh? well maybe they should stick to one story that makes the most sense and stick with that storyline for the time. spiderman just doesnt seem that deep and I think it would be better to watch just one.
I agree. Have you heard of the new spiderman universe cartoon movie? I heard it was good.
I hadnt heard about that one, I like that kind of stuff,  I think its crazy the amount of money they make with that kind,  crazy,  it was on TV till 2011,  hadnt seen it,  but it is crazy the amounts of money that they make off of that kindof stuff.
Yeah and I am surprissed by that.  Have you seen the latest avengers movie on Netflix?
He is really good in roles. I dont know if they will make a series based on the whole group, but the story is interesting. I think Spider man is the best of the group.
I agree. Nice chatting with you!
Are you a Marvel fan?  I just released a new comic book last week, "The Fantastic Four" it was released in a Marvel comic book.
I am! I like Marvel, I like Fantastic Four, what about you?
I like Marvel, but I guess they are not popular. Marvel is discontinuing publishing the fantastic 4. I wonder why. They have the amazing Spider-Man though, but not the fantastic 3 or 4.
It is sad, they have been a staple in comic books since the 1940s.
Yes, it is. Marvel offered to own the rights to the characters for $50 million but then rejected. They could have made a fortune. Sony would have made $50million if they had taken it and Marvel offered only $25 million but they rejected.
Oh man, they lost billions! That would suck. The ceo of DC said that he would pick up Fantastic Four for $50M and pump life into it, but the CEO is a different man.
Marvel finds all kinds of ways to make and save money.  They once argued in court that they should pay a lower rate to the Xmen because they are human.  Marvel finds a way to pay aLower rate than the XMen, and they argued that they are not human.
That is weird, and I think they are so weird.  They also used military tech to help acheive Spiderman like abilities.  I love how they acheives spiderman likeabilities using old tech.
Yes.  Disney is so big now that even Marvel characters are so big.  They show up in theme parks east of the Mississippi due to contracts with Marvel.  Did you know Disney has a theme parks in all of Mississippi due the contracts withMarvel?
That's odd.  Do you like Stan Lee?
Probably not. Marvel has a few good traits though giving a hard of hearing boy who has a hearing aid a superhero Blue Ear.  He can wear it and be a superhero.
That is really cool, I am glad for the boy, he is very cool.
Yes, exactly!  I like that Washington DC is where dc stands for detective comics.  I wonder what that stands for?
That is interesting.  Access is owned by DC and Marvel.  Marvel has been around since 1938.
I was not aware of that.  I would like to head to Michigan State University to see the largest comic collection in the world.  It is Marvel comics.
I'd rather step on the Illini guy's campus!
Spiderman's opening was performed by Aerosmith Joe Perry. I wonder how good the music was.
Interesting. Joe Perry? I don't know him.
Stan Lee was rich. His "Spiderman" had $200 million in revenue and only $50 million in net profits. I don't know if he was rich in other characters but he sure was in Spiderman. He had $500 million in Revenue and only net profits of $309.
I bet he is rich, he had so many hits.  I wonder who Imaine is.
I don't think so, but he got paid big.  In the 70's Marvel had a wedding of the spiderman with Stan Lee officiating.  That paid big!
Hi, how are you?
Good, how are you?  Do you read any Marvel comics or watch the movies?
I have, but I have not seen any of them yet.
I sure do. Walt Disney has bought Marvel and is hoping to use it's characters in its theme parks. I can't imagine Marvel characters in any Disney movies now.
I know Star Wars has a wing in the park with the "Wing"
Disney is in Mississippi and they have a big Marvel characters east of there, too.
I was thinking about that actually! I did not know that. I did see Thor at Universal in Orlando.
Marvel signed a contract with Universal back in the 90's to show the characters at Disney Land, but not Disney World.  I think that is where they show the Characters in Disney Land.
Disney is trying to get Universal to help them in terms of movies and rides, but Universal has its own plans as well.
I bet they do! I didn't know that Sony had the chance to buy it and didn't. I bet they wish they had! They could have bought Spiderman and see how many people would care for it. I wonder what they thought they were doing wrong. Sony had a chance to get it and they didn't!
Yeah they were, I heard that they are now owned by Marvel, I think they are owned by marvel, I wonder why the person who owns them is not a charatcher or a person
No, I have no idea who is that, Marvel has the scoop, who is it?
I guess it gives them access to all the characters from each universe, and makes sure that all characters don't cross over to the other universe.
talk about taking stuff from another universe and trying to argue it in court. Marvel has taken on the DC comic book universe and figures out how it figures out what mutants or mutants are and how to argue that in court, Marvel has the right to take mutants and other characters from the DC Comics universe to court. Talk about taking Stuff From Other Universes to Court!
I think the financial difference was hundreds of millions, so it is worth a shot, right?
I guess I would have to say with a straight face if I were a lawyer or judge.
I think in a lot of cases it would be worth it just to let people laugh at you. It also pays well. I wonder if Marvel has in-house lawyers. They are salaried so make them earn more than just having people laugh.
True. I bet it was fun working for Stan Lee when he ended every phone call with the word "excelsior". I bet you never heard that before, but I wonder if it's true?
That is a cool line! I wonder if he hung up on the phone?
Not really, I'm too conformist. In order to be creative, a company released a generic comic book that had super-hero and super-villain. It was smart of them to trademark the name in order to keep it creative. It's not like DC to trademark names like super- Hero and super -villain, that company published a generic book.
Nice chatting with you!  I must get going.
Hello.  Did you know the new V venom movie is coming?
I'm not sure, but it will star Tom Hardy? What do you think?
He is Spider man and he does not like villains.
He was, I wonder why they decided to have venom in the movie?  He's one of the best villains, so they decided he was the best in the whole movie!
 venom is not catchy but it is true that there are comic book names that are catchy
I wonder if that's true at all.They say it will attract all sorts of audiences though.
Deadpool stuck closely to the comic book as a franchise so I can see it doing well there.
I think that Ryan Reynolds is great, he is really funny and he did very well in the first one, I liked him.
I think he sort of is like an anti-hero, sort of like the subjects of movies. I always thought that comic book villains were more anti- hero but maybe I am not really.
Yea, people have come up with all sorts of hero movies and all sorts and all kinds of super-hero and super-villain movies.  People want the generic stuff and the new stuff.  Marvel published their own comic book in order to trade with the mark of the marvel in 1933 and published the first super- hero movie at that time.
That doesn't surprise me.  There were rumors that the Venom antagonist is going to be the new spider man villain.  Carnage!
Is Carnage evil ? Is carnage evil ?
Yeah. C Carnage is more lethal than venom, I think.
I wonder what makes it even more lethal?
Well he has a power similar to Spiderman, but alien, but with a power different than spiderman.
I had no idea, that is crazy, I wonder what the point is for him to be human at this point, it seems crazy
He is an extraterrestrial parasite and the enemy of Venom, and the long range goal is eventually tie him in to the Carnage, an extraterrestrials, spiderman mega-movie that will have him as the extraterrestrial parasites enemy of venom, his long range Goals.
Wow.  That is amazing..I can't believe that it will be out in a few days.Who is playing Peter Parker?
I have no idea.  I like Spider Mans but I think he is in all the batmans at the same time so I have no other idea.
I wonder if they felt George Clooney was better?
Yes, he was successful in both. Sony bought the rights to Spider man for $75M which was a bargain since he was already Spider Man 2.
Hi!  did you know that people can actually swim weeks after birth?  They can swim weeks before and even weeks after giving birth.
I don't. I'm afraid I'm not that old. Did you know Elmo testified to Congress about the funding PBS used for it and they were afraid of what they would say?
Elmo cheated on his taxes? I wonder if he did?
Lol, your initial comment is probably right.  Do you remember the swimming baby on the cover of Nirvana's nevermind?  I remember that.  That was the cover, and I remember the Swimming Baby was on the first cover ofvana's never mind.
Yea I don't go in the pool much but I would like to learn the "front crawl thatnative Americans introduced to the British" and the "back crawl" that the Brits introduced to us, I think I'd be better off in the "pool"
Interesting!  I don't live near a pool and I don's a lot of walking for cardio.  I do a lot for water outdoors.  It's cold here in DC at this time of the year.
Do you ever watch swimming on TV? The olympics have more gold medals in swimming than the rest of the world combined. The US has almost as many gold medals as the rest the world.
I watch the Olympic's as well, I like swimming, I think it's interesting how countries develop a division of labor and how good they are at it.
The Olympics did ban one swimsuit worn by the winners in certain races, did you know that? I wonder if there are other swimsuits out there like those swimsuits?
That is weird, I thought choosing swimsuits for characteristics that aided speed was just a accepted thing, but to do so because of how many thought was unfair, is weird.
I guess the U.S. Congress found something unproper about the olympic swimsuits?
I wonder what they wear?
I guess if they had access to it, I guess they could swim like dolphins. I don't know what type of swimming were people swim, but I know people swim like them, I wonder if they swim like the dolphins do.
I have heard of that but never noticed it. I think we have weird ideas for sports! On the subject of shoes, I heard that there is a surplus store that has 5000 pairs of shoes for only $5.00 each. I have been to a surplus shop before and never noticed. I work in a surplus department store and have seen boots that have lasted 10 years. I wonder how they lasted the time I have had to work in the surplus store.
I have several pairs of shoes.  It's just so crazy that there are 5000 year old shoes that perform better than modern shoes.
I'm not surprised.  Most of the stuff today is deliberately designed to fall apart.  I don't buy most of the shoes I see and buy.  It sounds like the stuff from 5000 BC is better.  Some stuff today was deliberately designed not to be.
I wonder how many shoes Stephon Marbury promotes, but I'm sure they are not reliable.
Google it.  I think they are army surplus or steel-toed lineman boots.  Heavy boots.
I should buy some tea bags for my shoes, they absorb odor and can absorb odor.
I like teabags, a lot.
Nice chatting with you! ;)
Hey! Do you live in upstate NY? Did you know that Cornell has students that can graduate if they pass a basic swimming test like all of Cornell's other students?
I heard that.  That is quite a requirement.  I know some schools don't have that requirement. Did you know that the US has more olympic golds than all other countries combined?
I don't know if they have won with a dolphin or with a swimmers arms and legs. Swimmers arms or legs are bound and they can't be won by a dolphin.
That would be interesting! I wonder if they wear the swimsuit that was banned by the Olympics? I'd watch if the winners were wearing it, that would be so interesting. Wonder how good they would look if it was banned?
Interesting! So is watching swimming. Did you know that swimming is the top public recreational sport in the summer olympics?
The Native Americans beat out the British for most avid swimmers. The British only knew the breaststroke and the front crawl.
Cool. The British also chose not to have congress as their governing entity, because they didn't want to be recognized as the governing entity of their colonies.
The term congress even dates back to the middle ages, where they used it to parley during battle.
That is cool.  I heard Elmo is the only non-human to testify before the us congress hahaha  I think.
I wonder why they let a puppeteer testify?  It seems a bit of a gray area, why would a puppetser testify.
True, there is a fantasy congress where players draft members of congress and get points for legislative success.  Kinda nerdy but it's better than the fantasy congress's where playersDraft members of Congress where players get points.  Seems kinda nerdy...
I have been studying up on politics lately and there are only two republicans and democrats in Congress.  I wonder if there was a baseball game between the republicans in the baseball game?
That would be pretty cool, they do it annually since 1909.
It is, but I think the Republicans are winning, they have been the only one to win for the last 100 years so maybe this will lead to change in the next few years.
True.  There are three subway lines that go between Capitol and the House and Senate buildings.  Maybe they should have three at the same time for baseball?  Maybe congressman can use the House AND Senate buildings for exclusive use like the capitol.
I wonder why they didn't just have the woman's idea of the lines. What's funny is that a woman was elected to Congress before women could even vote! It was before the right to vote was even a right!
That is so true, and it is amazing in today's world that women could even have the right to vote back then, it is just amazing that it was able to vote in the US.
Yes, and men had already voted for the right to vote before 1916.
Good point.  Interesting.  I hope Elmo doesn't vote.  Steve Smith of the NFL Carolina Panthers leaves his cleats on the field after every field with the last play, so he leaves them on the turf.  homlessness..  Steve smith...  Vote no on that.
He does that even though he is losing and probably not going to perform well in new shoes, I wonder if he is leaving them on there because modern shoes do not perform like the shoes of 5000 years ago.
Shoe companies must be able to sell them for a long time these days.  I wonder if those shoes lasted a longtime.  Ballet dancers can go through four pairs of shoes in a week.  They sell them to the ballet dancers.
Not to mention the shoes that get thrown out due to being smelly.  Did you know the remedy for smelly shoes is to dry tea bags in them?
That's cool.  I've used dry tea bags on my daughters soccer cleats.  LOL  It's funny how fashion dictates that shoes have to be high, high, HIGH for comfort.  My shoes have high heels and I think fashion dictates they have to have comfort.
Comfort and style meet in the best of all worlds when you have the shoe.  Comfort and style.
Do you like to swim?
I love swimming, I wish I could be a professional.
I know, most people swim for recreation and exercise.
Yes, I like to swim but do not swim very much.  I like the doggie paddle.
I do not swim much, but my grandchildren do. I do enjoy swimming in summer. I enjoy watching swimming competition in the Olympics.
That's very sweet! Who is your favorite swimmer athlete?
Michael Phelps, he is the best, how about you?
He was on Ellen Degeneres show once, teaching Andy how to swim.
Oh cool. Native Americans introduced the front crawl swimming to the west when they were in the west.
No I did not know that, which front crawl swimming was it?
Sounds like the breaststroke. It uses hand strength. It was introduced by the British people to the Native Americans in about 50 BC. I wonder why the British did not use it like the Native American.
I wonder if they used the butterfly strokes?
It is very similar. The US has received almost as much gold medals in the Olympics in swimming as the rest of the world combined.
I wonder if having more practices increases the "stability" of the practices increases them.
Did you hear about that type of swimsuit that was banned from the Olympics?
I did,  I wonder why bikinis were banned?
In 1952 the olympic swimsuit was banned, but swimmers wearing the banned swimsuit won the races.  I wonder what appearance they got from their appearance.
Thats so weird!  That is such a ridiculous situation.
That is a ridiculous requirement.  Did you know that Cornell University students must pass a basic swimming test before they are allowed to graduate?
It is ridiculous! I would lose it! Good thing my major is not at Cornell, I would probably lose it as well,
I've got to run now. Nice chatting with you!
Hello! I find nature fascinating. Do you like trees?
Yes I do.  I think it is fascinating that even male trees can turn female.  Did you know that.
I didnt know that,  I think I didnt know some trees had genders also lol
I didn't either.  Do you like the fantasy genre?
I like fantasy yeah, I play fantasy games like fantasy football and other genre's, do you play fantasy game?
I like fantasy football too haha. I kind of want to see what fantasy film will win an academy award for best fantasy film, like the Lord of the Rings, did it win one or did it just win an Academy Award? I think the picture is ok, but I don't think it should win one
I didnt know that, Lord of the Rings is a great franchise I loved the first few movies and I didnt know about the second one, but that make sense, its a great Franchise
I think that theres an actual university where they study science fiction/fantasy literature with a concentration of Tolkien studies, they have a concentration in "fantasy and literature" reading.  I'm sure they study the lord of the rings everyday.
Sounds like a nice university, I wonder if George R.R. Martin ever attended that university, he sounds like he would be one of the teachers one day, I think he did.
He would be awesome, like the janitor who wrote a 15,145 page fantasy manuscript listened to by the janitors!
Woah, that janitor wrote a 15,145 page manuscript? that is so good, I wonder if he was famous for his work after the janitor's wrote a15,145page manuscript, I would have to look it up.
I wonder if it was discovered after his death or after his watercolor illustrations were already discovered after he went to death.
That's too bad, he was such a rich man!  I wonder if it was good, or a manuscript of some good.  It sounds impressive though.
I wonder if it was in science.
I do like science, scientists make big contributions to society, science is the way to make human kind better and smarter, they make human's more useful, scientists can make big Contributions to society.
Yes I think so too, did you know that there is a rocket scientist who is a coach in the NFL and a former rocket scientist?
I didnt know that, how did that happen?
I think it's matt patricia, he coaches the lions, I think he's a great QB, he had a great year this year haha, what did you think about his year this last year?
I guess he is a smart man, but he knows nothing about rocket science lol, I don't think it is rocket science
Haha, right! It was great chatting with you!
It was great chatting with you too, thanks for the cool facts, and for the scientist and a smart man the emperor of Japan, what a smart guy, bye!
Are you a Spider-Man fan?
I am I heard the most recent Spider Man film was very good, it won some oscars so it must have won some Oscars, what about you?
I heard it was good. hes my second favorite superhero, hes also my favorite superhero.
Have you read any other comic books?
I have read a few.  I miss some of the ones that had a lot of back story but not much of a lot.  Do you read them?
Yeah me too. Do you like comic books or manga? Comic books or Manga, they are graphic novels.
Cool, Stan Lee is so cool. I always end up looking at his phone conversations when I need excelsior!
I heard Stan Lee wanted spider-man to have a hyphen so people wouldn't confuse him with superman. Makes sense. I heard Superman had a hyphens too.
I agree, I think it is because superheroes get too confused and that is why people want not to confused with the other superheroes.
Yes, I know there are so many. There is a rival of cap'n crunch, called Sogmaster who actually exists in marvel. He is called SOGmaster and he fought spiderman.
I didnt know Cap'n crunch was a superhero, that is pretty cool,
I did not either! Have you seen the movie black panther?
No I havent,  I will have to check it out,  maybe on Netflix,  or maybe I will check it later,  do you like Netflix?
Oh, I didn't realize that it was on Netflix, did you watch it on Netflix? I'll have to make sure to. I didn's also called Blue ear, Marvel invented hearing aids to make this little 4 year old boy feel better about hearing and he became a superhero called Blue Ear.
I think I heard about it somewhere.  I love things like that.  It helps kids realize they are not alone when they do love things.
I feel like some kids have a hard time with that, especially those who have super powers.
I feel the same way!
The largest comic book market is Japan, and also France.  Another large market is the US.
I didnt realize. I have been to Japan, but didnt realize it was that much. France?
Yeah, I think the French people like their manga.  Manga is a graphic novels and there's a long tradition of comic books in France.
That is pretty cool.  Sony didnt know they could not bought spider-man when they bought it, so they had to keep using Marvel characters.
Wow I didn't know Disney owns part of Marvel, do you know?
I think so, the Avengers, Xmen, and Avengers Infinity, but it leaves out the other big character like the Xmen.
Speaking of the comic books, did you know that there is a comic collection at Michigan State University that is open to the public and is the largest in the world? I want to someday visit it, I wonder if they have comic books in it? Speaking of which, did You know that the U.S. has the second largest comic collection in the whole world?
That is pretty neat! I bet it is pretty diverse too!
yeah, it is, the world of the comics is a different world.
I think a lot of older comics, which is neat.  The development of comics goes back to the 30's and 40's so it's neat to see the development of Comics.
Yeah, it would, Marvel started in 1938.
That is cool that they had stuff that predated Marvel.  I wonder if Marvel is still a thing, or if DC still has stuff thatpredated them.
I'm not sure.  I don't really like comics.
Yes, there are so many universes, it is cool to think of them as a franchise.
Yeah, that is a smart business decision.
I think it is neat that Marvel published a generic comic book with the trade mark superhero and supervillain.
Totally.  Those were smart decisions.
It was great chatting with you!  legendary!
Have a good evening!  Thanks!
You too!  Thank you.
Spider-man has become so popular since he was created in 1938.
It's amazing Sony rejected buying the rights from Marvel for $25 million and they have already done over a dozen movies with him over the lifetime of the rights.  They missed an opportunity.  Amazing Sony rejected buy a second one for $20 million.
I know right!  It was the silver age of comic books!  Before the silver Age of comic book.
I was born in the early 60s but I remember pestering mom for a comic book.  I was a little boy when they first came to town and I was born with a hearing aid so I remember getting my hearing aids and going everywhere with them.  Marvel Comics has had a resurgence of late with DC's resurgence in the late 80s and early 90s.
I did not know that.  I like the comic where the spider-man alter ego Peter Parker lived an ordinary life.  Spider-man's alter ego peter parker lived in the 1960s.
I didn't know that. Peter Parker is the "Spider" and not the orphan? That was a bit of a bit much. I wonder what his abilities are. Stan Lee's dreams of radioactive stuff is amazing. I also think Spider-Man should not be confused with Superman, who is hyphenated so that Peter Parker won't be confused for the radioactive spider, but Stan Lee dreamed of having Spider-man hyphenation so he could be confusedwith Superman.
I did not know that.  I wonder how he did that?  Did he climb walls and shoot spider webs?
Spider-man has some interesting superpowers.  He even has his own Iron Man suit, which he uses in the Avengers movie.  Spider-man made his first appearance in the first Avengers movie in the iron man suit.
Many Marvel characters have superpowers, but Peter Parker is the only one written as human. The others deal with issues of adolescence and finance, while the Marvel characters don't.
Yes, human issues too. In any case, Spider-Man has his own alter ego, the " Spider-man" (who also has a superpower), but that superpower was not his only superpower in this case.  He also had numerous human issues, as well.  Did you know that in 1987, a Broadway musical "Spider-Man: The Broadway Musical" was canceled after just 10 performances because it was expensive and had numerous injuries.  In other words, it was not a Broadway production, yet it was canceled. I wonder how much that was, maybe $20 mill?
That musical is probably worth more than the Marvel franchise is now worth. Sony could of paid for it, but didn't.
That is true. I find amazing that there is a collector market for the comic books now. Marvel once published a generic comic books that had the trademark name "super-hero" for the super-villain and "comic book" which I find Amazing.
I wonder what the purpose of that was? Was it to keep the character shared between the two comic universes separate? Marvel or DC has a character shared in both?
I heard that.  Marvel is part of Marvel Studios, a comic book mecca around the world.  Wonderwoman, Superman, Superman and Wonder Woman are all part of the Marvel Avengers.  Michigan State University is a comicbook mecca.  I guess they have collectors like me who have seen the marvel avengers.
I did not. I wonder if they can take back their collection. Comics are from the 20th century. They originated in Japan and are back theircollection since the 40's.
Supposedly comic books came from real, real publishing tones.  In the US, there is a reprint collection of newspaper strips and humorous books with simple plots, with humorous tales of famous funnies.  They reprint the same collection of news strips in different tones, tones and tones, in different publishing styles.
Comics have a long, long history. It started in the 1930's and started out as timely publications, I think. I can't believe DC acquired the Marvel in 1966.
It has an impressive history. Stan Lee died in November 2011, after having passed away in 2006. He was one of the creative geniuses of the founding, and it is interesting that he ended up being the one who ended up with so much eccentricity and he passed. Stan lee died in november 2011, and he was 85. Creative geniuses! Well it was good to talk to you, Excelsior! Bye bye, and thank you for your eccentricity!
I don't think they can maintain a franchise like that, but Disney owns Marvel so I think they could maintain a Franchise if necessary.
Very true.  Apparently Marvel will be under the Universal Studios, which owns Disney, and Disney will own Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  George Lucas's creations are under Universal Studios.  I'm from Mississippi and we have a lot of George Lucas creations here in the US.
Stan Lee would have liked to end this conversation with "Excelsior!
I didnt know that trees are interesting, they can change their gender, I wonder why?
I've heard of that. I think reading is the best way to switch from male to female. I wonder if acer pensylvanicum did that. Did it switch to female because of reading.
I didnt know trees could do that, I didnt know that they bloom in two different sex apparently but I didntknow trees could be determined by which sex they are in bloom
I wonder how that affects the "striped maple" tree, a tree that can produce maple syrup, the only one in Canada, the striped maple found in the US.
It sounds like a pretty unique capability, it's a weird species, it also can switch sexes and takes a mere three weeks to bloom, that is a pretty weird species to be able to switch sexes,
Apparently it's triggered to switch from male to female so it doesn't cause damage, apparently it triggered to Switch
I am not sure, there arent really many info on how we view nature, I guess we have a lot to learn about how they change sexes but I would say we arent the only tree to do so, we have to view it from a different way.
Apparently the worry is that climate change will just make more females, which will cause damage to the species and it will end up in the end, so that would be sad for sure, climate change and all of the damage it will cause.
Specially because they are producing enough fruit to keep them around, specially since it is so late in the game. I dont think we should try to learn how to control it, we dont want to learn it too late as it might have consequences on the ecosystem and the only way to do that is to just keep producing enough Fruit.
On a lighter note, did you know that in Australia it is illegal to own a rabbit in Queensland, even if you have a magician's license.  You can be a scientist, but not a rabbit, if you own a rabbits, and not a magician.  I wonder if it is the same as being illegal to have a rabbit.
I didnt know that, that is interesting the Emperor of Japan is a scientist I guess, I wonder if he has a rabbit in Australia, I would like to live with the rabbit if he decides to leave power, I didnt know he was a scientist, interesting the emperor of Japan can be a scientist if he wants to, I don't know if he would want to live as a rabbit though
lol  I wonder if rabbits are found in a lot of literature.  In fantasy literature, rabbits are usually in Alice in Wonderland or watership,  or in fantasy literature.
I like fantasy literature too. George R.R. Martin is one of my favorite authors, and you?
I like fantasy lit, I am surprised to find that it is a pretty modern genre, I have never written anything in there, but I do like rabbits in Game of Thrones LOL, so I know that is fantasy lit
Yeah, I don't recall any LOL.  It seems like a modern genre I wouldnt have known that in my life.  If it wasn't for fantasy it would be a more modern genre i wouldnt think.
I read a lot of fairy tales as a kid, but I don't think they can be classified as fantasy, but they were certainly read a LOT of fairy tale.
Yeah, I think it would be. Good thing we don't mix the two. speaking of which, George r.R Martin was unsure about putting dragons in them.
No kidding. I've never read his books, but I imagine they're pretty good. They make great tv, I'd say, but if you read the books, it would probably make great TV, too.
I have not.  The series is a series, I think the name is great but the details are not so good so I am not sure of the details.  Are the books fantasy?  Are all of the books Fantasy?
I like to read on my phone while commuting too.  A fantasy author named Peter Brett wrote 15 novels in 2015.  It's amazing that he wrote all that and a fantasy author names Peter Brett.
That is amazing! I guess he took advantage of his unused time commuting!
Hi.  Do you like superhero movies?
I do.  I find some of them to be better in CGI.
I like Spider-man, but I don't like that the hyphen on his name means spider-man in the UK.
No idea, but I think it is because it is the last word of the word "superhero". Do you like superheroes?
Stan Lee did not want to be confused with Superman.
I guess that makes sense. Stan the man knew what he was doing.
He was a legend.  Did you know Marvel offered the rights to their characters to Sony when they bought Spiderman?  They could have bought Spider Man for only $75k but Marvel offered $130M for the characters.
I think that was part of the mistake on their part. They couldn't foresee the appeal of superheros to a public starved for entertainment.
Yeah, I'm sure they did. The voice of Madame Web was actually made into the voice of the Spiderman series back in the day and she made $700k for doing the voice
No, I have no idea who it was, who was Madame Web?
Yeah it is about Joean B. Lee, Stan Lee's wife.
I guess he chose her because she did not want the job. Have you ever watched the show That 70's Show?
I never saw it either.  I did like the spider-man musical that was an expensive production on Broadway.  It was the most expensive production ever.
It's not typical for a Broadway production of Spider-man.  It seems like an odd choice for a broadway production.
Yeah, and it would cost $30 million just to do the music and lyrics, and U2's U2 Bono.  I wonder if he was in it?
I guess it was an investment.  I would never risk my money on something that unusual, especially since the star factor is so unusual.  Do you like superheroes?  I like some of the movies but not superheroes.  Too much star factor, and I don't want the investment.
Yeah I guess so. I heard there is a superhero named access.
Yes I have, it is Marvel right?
I think it is DC. He is the superhero that maintains the balance of both.
Sort of like frenemies but I guess they are all frenemies for a sort of way, anyway.  Well I enjoyed chatting!  It was great!  I have to get going.  Have a good night!
Same here!  Have a good one!
I'm a big comic fan, I liked the new spider-man movie.
I haven't seen the new one.  Is that the one with Captain crunch?
I like that cereal from when I was a kid, the crunchberry kind, the cereal.
Yeah, I like to eat cereal as well, how about you?
Nah, I usually eat a yogurt berry smoothie for breakfast.
I do too!  I like Michael Jackson!  Hilarious!
I don't really listen to him as a musical artist. I respect his skill though and I respect grunge and punk. I am not a fan but I respect him as musical artist, so I respect it.
I think he is the greatest musician ever and I agree, I think he's the greatest musicians ever, do you agree?
He was one of the top rank artists of all genres. Hard to believe he was only a top rank in other genres. In terms of technical skill and creativity, he was the reason why they became sidekicks to adults. He even was in Spiderman comics for a reason.
Wow.  I didn't know that!  He has been in so many.
Yeah, kind of like when you notice that when you are a teen or a teen and you notice the "greatest generation" era of comics and you see Bud on Father.  He is much shorter than me and he was the sidekicks or "bud" to an adult superhero.  Kind of a way to infantilize the little ones with an "older" era.  The "greater generation" is a little much shorter and has a different head.  It is a different time and different era of DC comics.
I have never read anything about that, I do like spider man though.
nah i never did. i am not a comics person. i like movies though. i will try and catch up on the movies. You?
Yeah me too, did you see the movie Glass?
No, I have not seen it yet I heard it is not very good to be honest.  How about you?
It was good.  But it was so good, they killed Bruce Willis' character at the end because he was getting old.    "Die Hard" was better.
lol I don't know. I guess he has been a big part of pop culture since then.
Nice!  In 1938 DC Comics paid $130 for the rights to superman!
I read that recently, that's amazing, I'm a believer in copyright in the first place, but I'm an awful believer in paying for it when it's the creators of the ideas in the creators and I read that lately, that seems awful to me, paying that much for ideas you don't even need in theFirst place
It is hilarious. Did you know google purchased the domain gmail in 1998?
I did know that, I thought they originally owned it as a google application.  I think the name came from the google application, I think?
Yeah I think so too! Crazy! Well it was nice chatting with you!
Hello, how are you? Do you find science fascinating?
I do ezspecially natural science.
Were you aware that the emperor of japan is a scientist and still publishes papers? I didn't know that he was a scientist.
I had no idea! I thought he was an engineer or a scientist or maybe a scientist but I didn't know that! I also had no Idea the the world wide web was invented by an engineer! What fun!
Interesting. I thought it would have been someone who was referred to previously! The term scientist was only coined in 1853. That's strange. I always thought it was referred too.
They were called philosophers to this day and they still are.  They can put the picture of a horse on DNA!
I understand there is data in DNA but not sure how you fit it in.
I don't either. I read that it is astounding that they can do it. Do you like to read? My fave is fantasy.
I do like to read. I respect Terry Pratchett and find that he is the best at fantasy. I like to respect Terry pratchett, too. Do you know what the humerus is?
It is amazing how many people do this. I am surprised that there is a fantasy draft the national spelling bee. People will actually draft the National spelling bee!
I did not know that but I'm glad I did recently because I learned of that fantasy draft and now I know why.  You mentioned Terry Pratchett before and I learned that he actually received that honor due to his literature work.  The knights of the knights did not like his literature.  I wonder what was due to them not doing a fantasy draft?
I had no idea! My son loves his lit, but I never read any of his work, I think.
He's great! You mentioned fantasy drafting earlier. I read that some people also draft members of congress.  I wonder if they do that?
In the 18th century, people were writing fantasy novels.  Maybe one day, people will be reading novels in the 21st century.
Wow, fantasy has a long history!  I love Game of Thrones, and apparently George RR Martin was hesitant to include any dragons in it, but then became convinced to include all the dragons in because he love Game Of Thrones.
I loved it. I liked the books more than the show.
It was a person named Phyllis Einstein that convinced me to read them.  It was the name of the person named Einstein that decided to have me read them after dinner.  I think I will stick to the section about dragons and the dinner. The show is so descriptive, but I think the section I like best is the section describing the food and the dragon's side of the dinner with friends.  On a different note, did you know that a DRAGON SERVES DINNER!
The dragons were fun. I found it hard to get into the fantasy. I felt like Martin didn't place them in a show. I also found it's hard to see the show as a fantasy.
I love the intrigue, but it was a little complicated for me.  I am amazed that the longest work of fantasy is almost 4 million words long and is insanely long!  That's like 7 million words!  I can't even believe it is that insanely long.  It is definitely the longestWork of fantasy.
That's a lot of writing for awhile!  I heard a janitor in Chicago wrote a 15,145 page manuscript.
He shared it, too.  It could potentially have been a lucrative career.
I guess he could have, I love to read and he did have a lot of illustrations and I guess he liked a lot to do with it too.
I would love to see it as well.
Are you interested in fantasy?
Hello! I'm doing great! I do! I am! I think I'm at a point haha.
I like the genre, I used to read fantasy lit when I was younger and like Tolkien, I read fantasy novels when I younger.
I am interested in it, I have been to the Fantasy Congress, it was really interesting.
I guess for political junkies and policy wonks it would be a lot of fun.
Haha. I read that fantasy novels written in the 18th century, written by the Alien, have talked about a war between planets, aliens, and the moon. My mind is blown!
Wow.. that is amazing and so imaginative. I wonder who wrote that or if anyone wrote it.
I know right, I'm sure it was a shock people thought it was aliens haha. Back in the 50's when I didn't have time to read the longest work of fiction I would make it a shock to me to read it. It took me a while to make it through and I was still in shock, I wonder how I didn' t take the time to Read it
I don't either. I'm a janitor so I have not had much time to do anything else.
Yes, that was the one.  I wonder if he came close to a million words?
that is insane! how long could it last? 3 million words? that is way too long, I would write something like that.
ya I think it was just to keep them from getting bored haha, do you like science?
I am into science, I enjoyed it in high school, and I took science courses in HS.
Same here, I'm not a scientist, but I know a little about it.  Did you know that only one scientist has ever walked on the moon and he did it in 1846, that's nuts.
That will probably change in the future as there will be a lot of pure scientists in the pool of pilots, but I'm not sure how astronauts are selected.  There are a lot who want to become astronauts, but there is not a lot that want to be in it.  I wonder how a pool of "pure scientists" can be selected.
I hope it does, I feel they put too much work into it.
I think the scientists and engineers dont get to enjoy the fruits of their labor. they do all the labor. hopefully elon can change things for the better. but i think we will never know. i think that eloncan change things.
I hope so. I think it would be cool that Japan's emperor is a scientist. I don't think he has control of society, though. I mean, he's a scientist, but he's not in control of his minds.
The emperor in Japan this year? I wonder if all scientists and people trained in science will be the same? anyway, great chat!
Great chat!  Have a good night!
Have a good night!  Thanks!
Same here!  You too!
Hi! Did you happen to watch Deadpool 2? I thought it was really funny.
I did not but I hear it's funny.  It was family friendly so that is true.  I hear that it was family Friendly.
Yes, it is not family friendly but it does appripiate that it has a lot of blood and material in it.
It has a lot of big names in the movie, like Ryan Reynolds and a lot more,
There are a few other cool characters like cable and colossus, but I think he is the best one
I'm a big comic book fan and Colossus is one of my favorites, it's the movie that introduces the team X-Force
Yes, it is the movie about the team that introduces the X- force. It was a video game that was the first movie about that team. I wonder how much it would have been a higher cost to make the movie than the video game. It would have probably been a much higher cost.
Interesting, I hope the game was worth it. Are you a fan of comic books?
I am a fan of comic books. I was sad Stan Lee died.
He certainly lived a long, successful life. A fan of comic books, but he was also productive in more ways than one. I stopped collecting them a while ago because they are such an expensive hobby.
It is expensive but it is also an investment. He considered that the phrase excelsior, which is how he ended every phone conversation, was expensive.
I guess if you want to read all the biggest comic book in the public you can drive to Michigan State University in East Lansing, but that could be costing an arm and a leg, it's costing an elbow and a drive to Michigan State University.
That is a great idea I bet they have a lot of interesting comincs in there, comics have a great Idea I bet.
I used to like DC more when I was younger but I like Marvel better, what about you?
I didnt know that the dc comics is called detective comics.
I like detective comics comics too.  You mentioned Stan Lee earlier.  He was the creator of Marvel comics.  Did you know he wrote "Detective Comics" which is also the name of the creator's of Marvel Comics?
Wow I didnt know that, I bet those comics are pretty good, I like the ones from Michigan State University, they are really good,
I guess that would be a good place to start. I guess there are about 300 registered superheroes. I have heard that there are over 300 DC comics. That is home to many registered superheroes!
I bet there are some lousy superheroes, like the superhero called Normalman, I bet he's a lousy superhero lol
I can't imagine he would have a lot to offer, but sounds sort of interesting.  It sounds sort like it has a lot of interesting names.
I think its a hard job, he lives on a planet that's full of superheroes, it must be a hard jobs, to be on a planets that full of superheroes, but it is a hardJob to do.
Hi, have you ever seen the movie Deadpool?
Yep, I loved it, a lot of people did too. Apparently it is one of the highest grossing r-rated movies of all time for sure, and apparently a lot have liked it, it is the second highest grosser of all r-rating movies.
Nice.  The Deadpool video game cost more than the movie did to make.  Did you know that the Deadpool videogame cost more then the movie?
I never knew that! I wonder if Ryan Reynolds voice the mystery villain in the video game, he played him in the film, he also did Ryan Reynolds Voice in the first film
I have not played it, but I do know that Ryan Reynolds crossed over to DC to play the role that he played in the comic book Deadpool. Ironically, Deadpool 2 was actually destined to be a comic book, but shar-pei was a comic-book Deadpool, which led Reynolds to become a comic comic book.
 destiny required him to play the role and he was destined to play it. The Deadpool character was butchered in the first X-Men movie, so I think he would have done the character justice this time around. The second X-men movie was better, but Deadpool's character was not. He did not play his character justice.
lol  I didn't know that, did you ever read comic books as a kid?  I did.
I used to read manga and Alan Moore comics.  In Japan they've had comics since the 16th century and in the US since the 20th.
I did know that.  I am a huge manga fan.  My son is a huge fan as well.  He was a huge comic book fan when he was younger and I remember him reading a piece on the modern comic book series that he had no idea about, it was a piece about the first modern comic series he could remember.
I think that One Piece is great.  I think there is a comic called Famous Fortunies that has over 750 chapters.
lolol, I have no idea.  I need to figure out buying one piece books the right way.  It's a big learning curve for someone who doesn't understand the genre and has no idea what they are doing.  There is a big time to go through a one piece book and figure out buy one.  But, it seems like there is a really big learning Curve with One Piece books.
I understand.  Apparently the only superhero he doesn't understand is "normalman", which is not an actual superhero, but rather a normalman.
haha well he is into good stuff. There are over 300 registered superheroes in US.
I think I heard there are more than 300.  I wonder who needs to register.  Maybe punch man,  saitama,  genos,  punch man...
Nice!  I have not seen punch man!  My son would love that though haha.  He grew up on Garfield comics.  lol
I like Garfield, he is a classic.  What a weird comic to read.  He formed the pet force, a superhero team that is a weird comics name.  I don't know if he is the same superhero that formed the Pet Force.
lol, yes! I just googled one punch man, lol. My son loves those Japanese anime shows, he's on them all the time.
My son sounds like a cool cat, almost as cool as Stan Lee. He was the first one to end his phone calls with an excelsior, but not cool enough to end with "cool cat".
lol that's great!  I had no idea.  I just learned that DC comics stands for detective comics.  lol
I didn't know that either, it came as a shock to me as well.  Heck, Stan Lee wrote for them too!
lol! Yes, I think about him a few times at least.  It has been a real pleasure chatting with you, giving me good thoughts for my son and his new son.  Thanks for giving me some good times!
I hope you have a great day and your son has a great one! Bye!
Hi Friend, did you see the article "Excelsior"
Hi, it was nice to read! I am a huge fan of Marvel and comic books, so I thought the article was amazing!
I loved Deadpool 2, I really liked all the movies from the Marvel universe but I think Ryan Reynolds is carrying the role of the Marvel Universe well, I can't comment on the comic books, I think he's doing well in the movies but I don't think Ryan Reynold is carrying that much of the comic book value in the comic Books.
I found it very interesting that the video game that was used for Ryan Reynolds first appearance as Deadpool was actually a game for the Wolverine origin movies, I wonder how the cost to make that actually happen. I wonder why it took so long to make it to the movie since the video was actually Ryan Reynolds's first appearance in the video, I also found it interesting that it cost more than $100,000 to make the video video game, I think the video is better than the video games that are available, I would have liked to see the game as well.
No, I didn't. I really liked the movie, but hated his "gambit" of sewing his mouth shut, which ended up being a weapon that was used as x-force instead of a weapon.  It was a great way to get some great snarky humor out, but wasted on a character who was better off with his mouth closed.  The video game is more interesting than the movie.  I like the video game because of the snarking humor and the snarks, but I don't think the movie had the same wit.
There were a handful but I think that comedic timing is what's missing from X-Force. The team needs more comedic timing than that.
I just read an "article" that said that they are imagining Odie and the gang as Pet Force.  I'm imagining the strips from the Garfield comic with Garfield and the Gang as PetForce.  This is an article about a super powered dog.  It was fun imagining that.  Had a chuckle at the thought of Garfield's comic with a superpowered dog.
I do like the old ones where Garfield had problems and Odie fixing them. I can't imagine Garfield eating them.
haha that is true and poor Jon would be pulling his hair out in Elseworlds. Do you know that Marvel do comic books series, I question that one, do you?
Yes, they did.  Last week Marvel released a League of Legends themed comic with Riot games as one of the topics back in it.
Wow. The more you know about their stuff the deeper you go. It's interesting to note that Michigan State University library has the largest comic book collection publicly available in the world.
I found that extremely interested. I wish I had known that sooner. I no longer live in a region with that many comics, so I spent a good deal of time there when I was in the region and still do. I wished I would have had it sooner.  I am into detective comics, and have spent a lot of time on detective comics.
Are there any comic books you wanted to read? I saw Zazie Beetz as Domino, a lucky survivor. She is great. I think the role is a little redundant, but her attitude is so happy that it is great for her to be in comic books. She has a great attitude for being "a lucky survivor". She is a great role for someone with a role like that.
Josh brolin was really weird for that role, he should have played thanos and cable, I think the crossover was a little weird with DC, MCU, etc.
HahaTrue. I wonder what will happen if Fantastic Four or Avengers 2 ever does, and what will be the next one? I would like to see Chris Evans play the Human Torch or Captain America, or even Reynolds as Green Lantern.
I heard that Deadpool 2 is going to be the same movie as X Force 3. I heard that X Force will no longer be making another sequel to the first one. So, Captain America and the Xforce 2 won't make it in the same year?
Yeah, I thought the X-Force would be the Deadpool team up.  I am waiting to see how the end game pans out.  The Deadpool team has been taking chunks literally out of the Wolverine.  They would love to get that going.
It would be very cool if they did, I think it would be fun to see a Deadpool/Hulk vs Deadpool, Deadpool vs film the animated short films the animated films are amazing, I liked the Wolverine and Deapool team up, Wolverine and deapool, Deadpool and Merc with a Mouth, it would have been really fun.
Super-heroes or super-villains team up?  I think a standalone film that would include the planet Hulk timeline in Thor: Ragnarok would be a great way to go.  It's sad that there are copyrights marring such great ideas.  If they did a standalone Hulk timeline, it would be like a new trilogy of movies that would not include the planets Hulk timeline.
Agreed. But I highly reccommend the animated series when watching the Marvel universe because of the copyright restrictions as oppose to live action. Like Normalman, who has no copyright restrictions.
Normalman sounds fun, I'll have to check it out!
Yep between Normalman, it's a good one.  It's really cool how they are trying to live in the Marvel universe at the same time.  The multiverse is at an all-time level and interesting.  I really like the female reimaginations of the universe too, like the animated spiderman film and other female reimaginings of the live action film.  Very cool.
I have been hearing great things about the new spiderman and the multiverse. The universe must be huge for the mind to comprehend.
Spiderman is basically like the new Marvel with Sony permission. It's on RDJ, and I think it's ok.
Did you watch Deadpool 2?
I liked Deadpool a lot! It is as good as it gets. I really like Josh Brolin as cable TV is getting better.
I didn't watch the second one, I heard it was better than the first one and I was disappointed haha, I watched the first Deadpool but enjoyed it more, I think it was funnier, I don't know, people think Deadpool 2 is a comedy, I haven't watched it yet, but I'm sure I will be disappointed haha
I think the second movie was actually pretty good.  The third movie had a lot more tongue and cheek, and did not bring the same director back, so it may have been better.  They should have got the director back.
I have read the comics, but never seen the films.  I know hardcore comic fans like to lament the inconsistencies between the two and read the novels, but I have never seen them.
No I haven't read the comics, but I did play the Deadpool video game, I guess it was good and it did bother some people because it was better than the comics. Did you play the deadpool video game?
I did not, I don't really like video games. I know that the video game cost more than it took to make the movie. I wonder if the video games were any better.
That's impressive! I didn't know that. I mentioned that it is the second highest grossing R-rated film of all time. It wasn't directed by James Cameron or George Lucas, but it was directed by them. I wonder if the video game was directed or directed by james cameron or George lucas. Either way, the video games are awesome and impressive!
It was a unique film.  I thought that it was rated R, but I think that superhero films can be rated R for adults, like superhero films.
I agree. It was a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds did the voice of a mystery villain at the end of Deadpool 2. I think he was trying to do it so that Ryan Reynolds could do the voice without ruining it for everyone haha.
I wonder if Ryan Reynolds thought about doing that role because he was destined for it?  In the comic Deadpool, he and Ryan Reynolds crossed over from "Sharp-pei" to "Deadpool".  It seems that Ryan Reynolds was destined to do that role.
Thats funny. I'm glad they did not use Ryan Reynolds in the movies. I didn't read any of the comic books, but I've seen the movies so I know what he looks like.
I never really did. I went to school in the 8th grade and it was very trendy then but I found that the use of comics makes it redundant now.
That's crazy!  I think that stands for detective comics right?  Isn't that hilarious.
Have you heard of Marvel's generic comic book? It was published in order to trademark super-hero and super-villain names.
That sounds interesting. I will have to check it out. I hear that the libraries library at Michigan State University has the largest publicly available comic book collection. I wonder if they have the worlds largest comic bookcollection?
I wonder if there are any comics containing normalman?
I will have to check that out. Did you know Stan Lee had an icon that would end every phone call with the word Excelsior lol, I wonder if it was to end every call or if it is an icon for him to check
He was iconic, his legacy will live on for a long time.
I agree. Speaking of hinm, Stan Lee wrote 15 dc comics. I wonder what superheroes they were.
I like the punisher, he is kind of the most normal-ish of them all.
Did you know there are over 300 superheroes registered in the USA?
That is interesting, I wonder who registers them and what each role entails.
Haha that's a good point, I'm not sure but to be honest I'm surprised it's that low. To be honest Im surprised it is even possible haha
I'm also surprised at how many comic book fans there are, there's so many books available. I don't think I've ever read any of them.
I like some, but theyre kinda short. I was in a comic shop recently and comics only last like 15 minutes or so. I looked them up and theyre not worth $5 dollars for each. I used to read them as a kid when I was little and they were quite a bit. I think I was able to finish the first one in like 20 minutes, but then the other 2 or 3 were a bit too much. I just looked them at the comic shop recent and comics are only $5.00 dollars each.
I am stuck with digital comics. I tried something similar in the 90s where they re-launched them for like 15 years or so and it was a very expensive hobby, so I just stuck with Digital. I would stay away from the re-launch, it seemed similar to me, it seems like it would be a very difficult and expensive hobby.
It is expensive.  It's a lot of work to draw all the stories and print them all.  But it's worth the money if you like the stories.  There is a superhero called Normalman.  He lives on a planet of superheroes and his name is Normalman!  He's really funny and has no power haha, but he has a lot more power than I do and a lot less money.  I think it would be a lot better to have a lotmore power haha.
lol, that guy is the best lol.  Do you ever read comics?  I do,  I have a preference between Marvel and DC,  but I don't have a particular preference between marvel and DC.
I liked DC more as a kid.  My favorite was always Batman/Spiderman.  When I got older, it was the Xmen, then the DC, and then Marvel.  I think there is one character that I really like, though, that I've never seen before.  Batman is my favorite.
I liked marvel better when I was younger. I didn't realize dc comics only had Detective Comics comics, I didn'd say DC had a couple exceptions, but DC comics was pretty much the best of all time when I had time. It's funny because I don't really think Marvel is as good as DC.
haha I know right! kind of like the Garfield forum. Did you know that gmail was based off of the Garfield Forum? And gmail.com was originally purchased by them in 1998?
You learn something knew every day, I guess. I never got a chance to see Garfield, but I did see the superhero series called "Pet Force". I guess that was the name for a pet force.
Haha thats true. Stan Lee wrote 14 DC comics and there are over 300 registered superheroes in the US.
That is odd, traitorous...
Haha, it does, but I guess he reimagined batman and superman in terms of a change so it sounds cool, right?
Yes, I'll have to stop by Michigan State.  It's in East Lansing and it's the largest publicly available collection.  I wonder if he gave sort of a spin on the Marvel world spin offs that DC characters do.  Marvel's HQ is in East lansing.
Wow!  I live in Michigan,  I need to check that out haha.
That is funny. That is close to where I am, I'm in Nebraska.  I had fun I looked it up and Nebraska has over 300 registered superheroes!
It's too bad that the only person to make a registered Nebraska superhero is a 16-year-old, that is the only way to get one.
Too bad.  Maybe Normalman is in the multiverse.
Haha I know right, maybe he is somewhere in Nebraska?
Do you like superhero movies? Turker is my favorite hero
I am interested in Deadpool and also Spider-man, but I am interested to see Deadpool 2.
Deadpool is my favorite superhero, and the Incredible Hulk, I liked that movie, I think it was good, my favorite DC superhero movie, what about you?
It is the highest grossing R-rated film of all time not directed by James Cameron or George Lucas and was the highestgrossing r-rated movie of all- time notdirected by James cameron or george lucas
That's funny.  I have never heard of "War of the Avenger".  Have you seen it?
I have not, but I had heard the movie was better than the comic. Have you seen it?
Yes, I like the X-men, but my favorite is Wolverine and Iron Man, but I like them as entire movies.
Back to Deadpool, Ryan Reynolds had a vision of Deadpool made in 2011, it took him a long time to get his vision of deadpool made, he was only 13 years old when he made Deadpool
That is, I can't believe it took him 11 years to get a movie out. What were you thinking about it?
Yes, very impressive. He makes a great actor!
Are you a fan of comic books?
No not really, I know the industry is doing well though and has a lot of money, how about you?
There's lots of comics books out there, I'm not really a reader, but I know that the characters are all drawing me as a reader.
Interesting. DC comics paid $130 for the exclusive rights to superman in 1938.
Superman and Archie Rich is a valuable book I heard, knowledge of the Superman and Archie rich is a very valuable book.
It's funny that Marvel Comics spent 10 years convincing the U.S governement that they aren't humans.  They didn't like it.
So true. I like superhero comic movies because they make people laugh. I think Deadpool was made to make peoplelaugh.
I agree. There are 20 superhero movies set to be released between 2016-2020.
Wow that is a lot.  I liked the first movie, Black Panther, but that was the only movie I saw of them all.
I didn't see it yet.  What was it about?
No, but I forgot that the actor who played the Black Panther won, but he deserved those awards, I like the actor that he is, I forgot who the actor is but he really deserved those Awards
Well it was nice talking to you.
Hey!  Did you see Deadpool 2?  Did not see the movie, but it is the second year of the movie.
I did not.  I was surprised to find out that it was the highest grossing R rated film not directed by James Cameron or George Lucas.  It was the only film notdirected by James Cameron or George lucas.
I was surprised too.  I know the movie cost more to make than the video game.  The movie cost $15,000 to make and the game is just $60.
Nope, I didn't know that fact to be honest, I know it's the one about the super hero Normalman. I don't know much superhero stuff to be quite honest.
Wow!  That's intriguing.  I did not know there were that many superheroes.  There are over 300 registered in the US.
I used to read manga as a child, but as an adult I find the graphics mixed with the words jarring. As a mother of two, I think I was deprived of many comic books in the house, so my mother would let me read comic books.
Yeah I don't like comic books either.  I find them interesting but they are not for me.  Do you know what DC stands for?
Yep, it stands for detective comics. I wonder why that is? Is it because of the aspect that had your mother so opposed to them?
Yeah, it does seem a bit redundant, but still kind of interesting. Michigan State University has a collection of about 1000 comic books, the biggest publically available of comics available at Michigan State.
I read that!  I wonder if people can still read them.  They have been microfished or digitalized.
Ryan Reynolds is a good fit for the lead role in Deadpool 2, I find, but not sure if he would be a good fitting for a lead role.
I think he would.  I think knowing the storyline of the movie is just the bare basics for the bare Basics.
I liked it, the screenwriters were all excellent, and they voiced the mystery villain well.
I didn't know that. It was written by a reader girl who was able to pick a superhero power. Her superpower is just knowing how to read better than anyone else. What is your superhero power?
I would be the invisible man.  I wanted to be the man who could disappear.  Peace and quiet, no meetings at work, just disappear. That would be great.
 Invisible has its advantages, but if they disappear a work they tend to fire you, I think.
True. The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in a very fun place, the earth. Earth is a fun place. I wish they would change it up though.
The uniform for a superhero outfit is an outfit that has a tunic with silver and silver/red accents with red accents on it and thigh high boots with leggings with black or black boots and spiked hair, and the wear glasses.
I would wear something like blue and black.  I would have silver hair as well.
Me too.  I like copy cat too.
There was also a Garfield book spinoff called Pet Force, an imitation of the Garfield book Spinoff called pet force
Hello!  How are you?
I am good, are you a star wars fan?
I am, I think it's cool! What about you?
I do enjoy it. I like the original trilogy the best.
I do too. Do you have any memorabilia from the first ones?
I dont. Do you?
I used to have the original lunch box with thermos in it as a kid, I banged it on the part of a kid once and banged up my original lunchbox!
That's awesome, I have many things from my childhood that are part of my childhood and they are all awesome!  I still have my glow worm.
Ahhh, that's so sweet.  It would be big for Star Wars to have a merchandising franchise.  That's pretty impressive.  Star Wars is very successful in that it holds a Guinness World Records for most successful merchandise franchise.
Star Wars is legend, it spanned over 40 years, it's been around for over 16 years!
I didn't realize that James Earl Jones only spent 2.5 hours recording his Darth Vader's lines. In fact, he was only paid $7500 for the fact. I wonder if he was paid that little.
That's nuts, he is the iconic one and the voice of a lot of the films main scenes so that is nuts. Did you know that Marcia Lucas did the voice for a lot more of the iconic scenes?
I heard about that! I think she won the Academy Award for editing, George did the directing, but I think his wife was the one who won the academy award for editing. I wonder how she feels about that?
I dont know.  A lot of the break ups are amicable,  I dont know a lot about his movies though,  do you?
True!  20th century fox thought "The Last Tycoon" was going to flop, but it did!
I know, right?    Why didnt Harrison Ford get credited initially?
I wonder if people did not like him as a boy?  I wonder what they got wrong.
Yes. He is still going strong at 55 years old and going strong!
The star wars franchise is still going strong, but it shocks me that it has $65 billion, it was a childhood, not just my childhood!
That makes it the highest grossing media franchise. They can't beat that, though.
Yeah, makes you wonder!  Well, this morning I have to head into work, so it's been nice chatting with you, but I have got to head out.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day and make sure you don't go to the movies!
Do you like Star Wars?
Yea, I like the original trilogy the best, apparently the force awakens was selected to be locked in the vault on shutterfly, have you seen it?
Haha, I wonder how it got frozen?
Yea, I guess younger people don't find the Force Awakens that interesting and prefer Black Panther, but I guess older people also find the force awakens that interesting
I watched Black Panther, and it was interesting. I liked it, but I haven't seen The Force Awakens, but will definitely go see it.
I have not seen them, but I heard they are good.  Black Panther is the first one I have seen.
I havent watched it, but havent watch is Frozen yet. The villain in Frozen is actually Elsa. I guess they changed her character because the song was uplifting and well written and really catchy. I wonder if the song changed because the villain was the villain, but the song is catchy.
Yea, I'm surprised Frozen didn't come sooner, sooner. I figure that would have been the first female directed Disney animation.
That is interesting, I wonder how they were able to call it Snow Queen because feminine titles don't perform well on TV. I wonder if it's because they call her queen because feminine names don't do well.
Yea, the title of the film stopped it from grossing a billion at the box office and it was the snow queen, so they had to come up with a title.
Tony is a writer/director who has won an emmy, grammy, oscar, and an oscar for his stuff and also won an Emmy for his writer/directors work.
Yea, Robert Lopez is pretty talented, he wrote a South Park episode too
Interesting. I quit watching TV when my kids were little, but keep meaning to watch more movies, I think. I've been meaning to Watch Black Panther.
Yea, apparently the black panther character is the richest superhero worth $500 billion, he is the wealthiest superhero!
Yeah, that is suprising Tony Stark is only worth $80 billion, but he was worth $100 billion.
Yea and Bruce Wayne is actually worth like $500 billion
I don't see the point. Black Panther was going to be called Black Leopard. It's popular but I think it's better called Black Panther.
I never knew that lol I also never knew the Black Panther comic predates the Black Panthers party, I never knew The Black Panther Comics were from the 1960's, lol
Yeah, I was wondering if the black panther party is the Black Panther party.
Yea, apparently Denzel Washington funded Chadwick Boseman's tuition for a theater program, that's nice of him.
That is really cool. Two years later Boseman thanked him in person.
December 21, 2015, The Force awakens.
No I did not, but I thought it was pretty good. What about you?
I loved it. I am a huge Star Wars fan. Abrams did a fantastic job on the score! I can't believe he did that. He is a huge star wars fan.
Yeah I thought he was intense, I think the whole Star Wars project must be really intense, so many fans it must be tough for him, and yeah I thought that was really well done.
It really is.  There is a crowd that supports Star Wars.  I am not in that crowd, but I am in that Crowd.
Yeah that is true, I guess there are some people who really like the film, I never really got into it, but yeah, I do like the first film
I wonder if anyone in that age bracket preferred Black Panther to Star Wars.
Yeah I read that,  have you seen the Black Panther film?
I didn't see the film of Black Panther.  I didn't like the comics films of the genre that came out from Marvel, but it fell under the category of DC Comics films.  How about you?
Yeah me neither, I like the xmen films better than the marvel movies though, I never got the chance to see the xMen films or even watch any of the marvel films by any chance
Did you know that Black Panther is worth $1 billion.  Tony Stark is worth more than $100 billion.
Yeah, I'm surprised they made a superhero more wealthy than stark and Bruce Wayne.
George Lucas was very talented and began Star Wars, his net worth is $8.5B, he was very talentful and began star wars
Yeah I am not sure but I would have thought he was around $100M starting way back in 1977 with the creation.
Probably had no idea.  James Earl Jones was actually going to pay $500,000 for voicing Vadar, but they did not pay him.
Yeah that is pretty good dough per hour, though I just read how long it took him, I think.
True, but I think he was good and deserving of it. I mean he was in movies that had over a billion box office.
Yeah they are, which Star Wars films are your favorite of the three?
I do not have a favorite, I like Empire strikes back the most, it's my favorite to re-watch, what about you?
Yeah, I agree with you.  I can't believe people can't pick just one.
Good choice, it was a really nice meeting you. Nice meeting you
Hello, do you like movies?
I do. Do you have a favorite one?
I like the star wars films from back in the day, how about you?
I know right, they made awesome films in that time, they were groundbreaking and they were made in the 70's and 80's they were the best of all time
George Lucas was crazy, he knew how to get money off of toys, Fox News and Toys R Us. He knew how much money to get.
Yea, and he was willing to forgo $500,000 in directing fees for licensing, I think he agreed to that so he could forgo the $15,000,000 directing fees
Half a million is a lot of money for a franchise, but I guess it's a lot for a lot less these days.  I think the franchise has a long-term potential though, so he could be a billionaire in the long-run.
Wow.  Apparently James Earl Jones spent only 2.5 hours recording all his lines for Star Wars and got paid $7500.  He only took two hours.
I wonder if James is still making it, he was number 1.  Did you know that star wars was dubbed in Navajo in 2013.  It was the first major film to be dubbed in a native american language.  That's a very serious project for James to take on.  Star wars was the 1st major film ever to be dubbed in a Native American language.
That is kind of interesting, I wonder if he does, he used to do it regularly, kind of Interesting thing to do.
I wonder what Navajo fans think that George never won an Oscar?
That is sad. It's amazing his movies were so well liked.
The Academy has a lot of politics in it. He got an award because his wife was the best actress at the Academy. He must have made the wrong kinds of films, or made the right kinds, but he was given the award.
Did she get an award?
She got an oscar for editing. She had ideas of a lot of plot points and she helped shape the film.
Awesome!  Did you ever see Frozen or Black Panther?
I have not. I think it's strange that it was the first comic book film to get an Oscar!
I would call it that.  I thought it was a masterpiece, but I was wrong.  It held my attention though.  My daughter saw it when she was young and she loves it.  No time for Frozen though.
I bet, it has a lot of great songs and it was directed by a woman, so a lot to go on, a woman and a lot Of great songs.
Yes, it was.  Pretty cool that she did that,  I like strong female characters!
Yes, girls need role models like that!  Good for them.  Well, I enjoyed chatting!
Same here.  Thanks!
Are you a Star Wars fan? I like the movies. I can keep track of the old movies.
I am! Did you know hans solo is the last Star Wars story?
I have not seen it yet either.  I saw the backstory movie, " robots in love" from Disney.  It was okay, I like the character and the backstory Movie, but the second one, I didn't like it.
I am a skeptic about this one, but Harrison Ford is a skeptist, since he made Solo so loved by the character.
Yeah, he balanced it well, the Force was very balanced in the film and not all mumbo-jumbo like in the old ones.
I didn't realize that Al Pacino was chosen for the part of Solo.  I understand the script didn't like him, but it turned out well, he didn't understand the Script.
I bet he didn't, he made a strange solo, I know the casting is key to a movie's success, Sean Connery was offered the part of Gandalf, I bet he would have been a success in the movie, but not Solo, he did not take the part, he would be the best for it, casting is KEY!
True. I wonder if Christopher Walken would have made a difference in the Hans Solo. He was considered by Lucas, but he was not given the role. I think Hans Solo would have been the best, but Christopher Walkon would have still made a changes.
He could have done a darker, brooding solo with great dance moves.
George Lucas' wife, George Lucas' Wife has had a large impact on many of the movies. She won an academy award for the editing of the first star wars film and she has won 3 more.
I think that was the first Oscar that George got. I'm sure that he's content with the one that he got. He's a billionaire, but he doesn't do much everyday besides count his money.
Poor James Earl Jones.  He was the original Star Wars voice of Darth Vadar and at one time only made $7500 for each of his Darth VADAR lines, which he said is nothing.  Poor James EarlJones.
I never knew that he only made that much. That's money that he could have made on another movie. I bet the next movie paid handsomely.
I know.  Century Fox thought it was going to flop.  They were wrong.
They did, they gambled smart though. They had the cash to set up Lucasfilm. They could have used it for merchandising and the cash for the merchandised rights.
I agree.  I think there is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe of planets / stars.  That would explain how there are galaxies and all the stars.
I think he might, it's a crazy theory. One electron in the universe, one electron and yet we have a hologram of the universe. Sounds like an alien race or some other entertainment system. Have you heard of that? I heard it was the work of an alienrace.
That's what I can only imagine.  I know that you can touch some stars even though the temperature is cold, they burns so bright, and I can touch them.  The temperature is cool but the sun is so hot that you cannot touch some.
I wonder if star energy probes will disappear in our lifetimes if we don't harness the power of fusion and come up with a better source of "star energy", flying electric cars, or if star power probes will appear in our flying cars before we can harness the energy of fusion in another source.
I wonder how that sounds, Lucas is into things that use language in all things. Interestingly, Star Wars was made dubbed in Navajo. This sounds like a lot of success for a major film, it sounds like all of Lucas's films have been made dubbed.
I think that Star Wars is going to be the series to see. There will be a sequel made on Mars in 2023.
That sounds very interesting. I wonder if they will have any connections with the large green alien from the first one. Lucas had originally wanted Hans Solo to be a large green aliens.
Hello Turker, do you think the Star Wars movies are the best?
Yes I have. Harrison Ford is cool. detached and ironic is the best way to describe his performance as he is detached andironic.
Harrison Ford was ok, he played his part well, he was the return of the Jedi, the best.
I was skeptical of the first film, but liked it.  I saw the second one and was not as skeptical.
I don't remember that, I do remember the first actor Luke Skywalker in Star Wars.  I didn't care for Star Wars at first.
I think Hamill looked like a goof.  I hear there will be a sequel!
Hahaha that is so strange! I haven't seen the show Star Trek since back in the days, do you watch the shows?
I haven't watched Star Trek, but I have seen a few fantasy things like the Lord of the Rings and the Game of Thrones.  I'm not really into those fantasy things, more intellectual.  With exceptions of the Lord Of the Rings, Harrison Ford and Star Trek I've seen.  Do you?
James Earl Jones spent only 2.5 hours recording all of Darth Vader's lines for star wars and got paid $7500 and was paid $7,000,000 for just doing those two hours recording Darth Vader lines
No, I did not.  I wonder if theopher walken's voice would added some edge to it.
I know, right? Did you also know that George Lucas is a billionaire because of the Star Wars movies, he is a billion dollar billionaire
Wow! That's a poor house to be in... Luckily he didn't make solo a green alien as originally planned.
Did you know there are stars in the universe that cold enough to be touched by human hands? I wonder if there are any stars in that universe that are cold enough for us to be able to be touching.
No, I didn't know that. That would make the theory that the universe is one giant superhologram, wouldn't it?
I don't know. I think the theory of only one electron in the universe is the only theory.
That would be a sight to see.  I think space is pulling galleries apart, I wonder why.
I wonder if it's because of the role of Han.  I understand the script has him in it and I don't understand how they let Pacino turn down the role.  He did the same role ofHan.
Did you ever watch the Navajo version of it?
Christopher Walken was considered the part of Han solo in the first Star Wars movie, but Pacino turned down the role.  Then Pacino turn down the part in the second movie, Han Solo.
James Earl Jones made $700 000 for the thought of it, but thought it was going to flop.  James Earl Jones makes more than anyone in the 20th century.
True. Initially they also wanted him to play Han Solo, but he wanted to be black so he could play Han solo.  George Lucas was working on Star Wars when he saw that.  He said that black actor are not as large as they used to be.  That is very true.
Are you a fan of Star Wars?
I am, Harrison Ford is a great actor, do you know him?
ya he is, I do too, do you know how much money the series has made? I know its over $8 billion
That's surprising. I wonder how much they make now, moeny is too much.
There are also a lot of toy light sabers.
That is a lot, I heard Marcia Lucas had a lot of great ideas for the series, she has some great ideas.
Yeah, I know.  George Lucas didnt know she won an academy award.
Yeah I heard she won the award for editing the film, Star Wars, the first movie to be dubbed to Navajo and I heard her won the Award for editing that movie
That is cool.  Fox gave Lucas licensing and merchandising rights because they thought the film would bomb.
I bet they are regretting this choice now, that cost them billions, and he definetely got fired lol, he is regretting it now and probably regretting that choice as well, I bet he is really regrettingthis choice and he sure definetelys got fired LOL
It sure did, it was worth $1.65 billion, and now the franchise is now worth $2 billion!
Star Wars explored the universe as a kid. Some things in the movie are fiction it made me believe, but some stars that I've seen are so old they can be touched with bare hands, even though Star Wars explored it as a movie.
That is crazy, I know the sun puts all that energy we have, the energy of the sun.
I guess that energy runs out eventually.  There is a theory that the universe is a giant hologram.
I guess I don't know about that.  I do like the theory that there is only 1 electron in the universe.
I agree there is a lot we do not know about the universe, I like to keep an open mind, I dont know about it but I like a lot of what we know about our universe, what about you?
Yeah, did you know the observable section is only in the observablesection?
Yeah so back on the Star Wars topic, on the same day Al Pacino turned down the role of Han Solo, did you know that?
No, that is unfortunate and I know he has to regret that.  I know Christopher Walken was also considered, and didnt understand the script, which is why he took Christopher Walkon instead, which I think he regret.
Han Solo was also very lucky. He evenbecame the pilot of the tie fighter, the millenium falcon, and even Ford's F-35 ford tie fighter!
Yeah very lucky for him.  He wasn't even allowed to audition for the part.
That is surprising, but he was perfect for the part. That movie was so good because it grosses over $270 million worldwide, it is the second most grosses for a movie.
Do you find fish to be interesting?
I do too! I think they are very interesting. Did you know that the seahorse is the only fish to have a neck? I didn't know that.
That is interesting. have you heard of the black swallower fish?
Yea, the Black Swallower sounds lke a scary fish, like it can eat prety much for it's length and be able to eat anything twice its length
That is pretty terrifying!  Twice my weight, and then twice it's own weight?  I wonder what it digests all the times.
I'm not sure but I think it would be useful for research if true. I know a zebrafish shares 84 percent of genes associted with human disease.
Yes, I agree, they should be studied for sure.  They could probably study the " immortal" jellyfish that is studied to see if they find out what it does, I wonder if it is immortal, or if it just wants to be studied like the jellyfish is.
The immortal jellyfish sounds like something out of science fiction. I wonder how long the oldest one has lived.
Good question!  I think it's ancient and they usually die when they get a disease or injured.  They are ancient but don't die.
I wonder if there is an immortal jellyfish, it's pretty funny that there has been immortal jelly fish that has been stinging humans since ancient Egypt, I wonder how they know that?
That would be funny!  How do freshwater and saltwater differ?  How can they consume water?
Yea, apparently freshwater fish drink through their skin by osmosis and salt water fish just drink throughtheir mouths
Interesting.  On another topic, do you enjoy Disney films?
I do. I loved the Lion King. It was the first Disney movie to be dubbed in Zulu, and the first movie to ever be dubbed. I think there is only 1 disney movie that has been dubbed in zulu.
I'm glad it did. I think it was the first animated Disney film directed by a female. I did not enjoy it as long as the first one, Wonder Woman was Frozen.
Yea it seems like it, Frozen was the first movies Disney has made that was female directed but I figure that there have been many movies disney has made before that were female directed.
I agree. I also noticed identical scenes in many disney movies.
Yea, I've seen videos on youtube that show the identical scenes that Disney recycled and I wonder if there are any videos on YouTube that show that
Yes, in that decade they recycled a lot of those frames.  I think it was budgetary of time concerns.
Possibly.  It stared development is way back then.
No. I didn't know that. I'm just glad that they were able to add some of the cool characters who never existed. It probably would have taken longer to make if they didn't add them.
Oprah on "A Wrinkle in Time", do you know much about it?
I read the original. I liked it when I was in elementary school. I think it was by Madeleine L'engle way back when.
It is a good book, the young actress who does the plays Meg in the movie is really well, she really takes the movie by storm, she is such a young actress.
Yeah, I read it and felt a bond with the character. I think I related to her on many levels.
I was surprised to find that Meryl Streep's first role was in a sports movie. I would have liked to see that for sure.
Hey that's pretty neat! And she speaks fluent Italian, I wonder what she does in italian? I wonder if she speaks italian at all?
No, I did not know that.  Her daughter plays an FBI robot in the series.
Yeah, I saw that. I'm surprised she is still responding to that language. I know she did auditing for King Kong and an Italian producer called her ugly and in his language. That's embarrassing for sure, huh? He called her Ugly, and she's responding to it now?
That is hilarious, that is awesome. Did you know that she was nominated for three Academy Awards?
Yeah, she has some stiff competition though, yeah she's been nominated 13 times and has won 6 times, that's weird, she's never been nominated more than once, that seems like a stiff competition
Well maybe it has something to do with politics, or how much it inflates awards.  lol  I never knew her middle name is actually louise,  but her grandmother's name was louise.
That is awesome!  Speaking of awards, did you know that in 1997 she received 13 Golden Globe nominations and won 3?  That is a lot of awards.
It is.  Frozen was the first Disney film to be directed by a woman, and the first ever Disney film that was all inclusive and all woman.  I think it's about time that they are more inclusive.
Huh.  I remember seeing sworn brave.  It was co-directed by a woman.  And co-written by a man.  That's old.  lol.
lol, I'm getting old too. I didn't know Disney actually recycled some of their animation frames for their movies. I wonder if those artists receive royalties.
Yeah, I think so, there's a youtube video about that. and yeah, I wonder if they recycled them for the dance scene in Snow White where they were recycling the dancing. The first disney movie to have dancing is the Robin Hood cartoon.
That is insane. It is a good movie though, taking three decades to make it is a really good movie.
Ahhhhh blasphemy! I loved Wreck it Ralph!  I guess I like it better than Lion King. Did you know that the Lion King was the first film to be dubbed in Zulu and it was dubbed in  Zulu?  AHHH BLESSED OUT!
I did not know that,  that is amazing!  Thanks for chatting,  have a wonderful day!
Hey, you as well! Hope the weather is good where you are!
I am doing well too!
Hi, how are you?
Hello, do you like fantasy movies?
Hello there, yes I do, do you?
I love Disney movies, do you ever remember the movie wall, Pixar?  It's a Disney movie, right?
I don't remember it. Was it a good movie?
It did make reference to the fullname of walt disney's walter elias disney, which is the full name of w Walt Disney Walter Elias Disney.
Yea, I read that somewhere, factual.
What are you talking about? Minnie Mouse full of herself?
Yes it is Minerva Mouse.
I think that is cute, that movie took the longest time to produce though, I think the movie took a long time
Yes, thief of the cobbler and the animation took over 16 years due to lack of funding and complexity of the animation of the thief,
I wonder if there were money problems because of dalmatians and their record.  Do you know about dalmastians?
They used xerox for some of the animation to save money.
It kind of fell it lacks fantasy but still achieved a great result I think its one of my favorites, it's achieved a Great result
I agree!  Is Dalmations a fantasy movie?
I think I heard about that, I think it was a more realistic one, I wonder how much money actors make signing autographs, do you know how muchmoney actors make sign autographs?
I have not, I never realized that, I wonder how much they are paid for them?  That's a crazy amount of money!
I wonder in some cases if it is kind of a side job, kind of like a salary or a salary for a sidejob?
I wouldn't think that.
I don't think I would either.  Did you know the first fantasy movie to win an Oscar was a fantasy movie?
I accidently hit enter and I had to look up the response.  I don't mind a little fantasy movie on my side job, but a lotr than one to win an academy award?  It's like a side job!  I wonder who the first fantasy movie to win one was?  I'll have to think on that.  Sorry, I accidently HIT enter, I think I saw a lot of "What's Up" on TV, but I don'm not sure what else was on there that I could come up with.
I wouldn't mind that side job either, hahaha
Well I have to go, nice chatting with you!
You as well. Thank you.
Hi there, how are you today?
Hello, I am amazing! How are you?
I am doing well, thanks. Do you like fantasy drama?
Yea stuff like game of thrones and such
Yes, Lord of the Rings and such
Yes! Lord of the Rings is a classic and the long format influenced so many of the movies today. I wonder if the films are still in use today.
I agree. I wonder if it was the first fantasy movie to ever win the best picture award at the oscars? It is the only one to win the Best Picture award at both the oscar and the best fantasy movie.
Which is your favorite?  Out of all the lord of the rings mine is Legolas, do you have a favorite?
I like Aragon too, I think he was able to protect himself.
What is your favorite film out of the original trilogy?
I really like how Gandolf returns to lead the army and the battle scenes, I like how he can fight and do whatever he wants, and how he will lead theArmy.
I liked the movie, the amazing Special Effects that they made even though it was made so long ago proves it, Lor and Harry Potter had some amazing special effects in that movie.
I like Disney movies, but I don't really know much about them. What about you?
I am, Lion King is one of my absolute favorites, what about you?
I liked FLUBBER. Did you know it had a science consultant who was a science professor?
Robin Williams was amazing! I never saw that film, but I know who he was.
It was probably Bill Nye the science guy haha.
He is a great dude. he is such a proponent of education and science and a big speaker.
Awesome, I had no clue what Minnie Mouse's full name was! It was great chatting with you!  I have no clueWhat Minnie is, is she a mouse?
Have a fantastic day my friend!
You too. Thanks. You too
Hi! Do you enjoy movies?
Yeah, I do.  I like Disney movies, do you?
Disney has done a good job toning down stories yet making them still interesting.
Yes, they really do.  Did you know that roy and walt disney founded the company on october of 1923.  The master was only 15.
I haven't seen a Disney film in a while.  Have you?
I loved "the Lion King" I can believe Walt Disney makes 700,000 dollars per second for that. I wonder how much he makes now.
Nice.  I recently re watched some classics.  They do a good job with recent films like Wall-E.  Do you think he has done a goodJob with recent ones?
My son loves Wall-E.  Disney doesnt have any ads, they only do shows and products that they like.
I did not know that, but they are always updating their technology from hand to hand, like the 55,000 core supercomputer for rendering.
That is awesome! I bet that is how they make the movies! I guess Walt Disney got fired because he wasnt creative enough to make a Rom com. I would have never guessed that. I guess he didnt think it was creative enough, I bet he got fired from The Newspaper because they were trying to make the movie into a newspaper.
I would argue he was a visionary in many ways.  He helped establish the company in American animation and theme parks, and helped establish The Walt Disney Company in American Animation.
I agree with you on that one! Do you like fantasy films?
I enjoy them because they have a lot of world building with mythology, supernatural, and the supernatural.
Yes I do too. I also love the Harry Potter movies too.
I really enjoyed the book and the film!  I did not like the lord of the rings but I enjoyed the books more than the film.
I heard that Harry Potter was the director of the film Troll, but it only appeared on TV. It seems that J.K. Rowling stole the idea for the film from the film troll.
I hear that. There's even a fan convention for Harry potter. It's quite lucrative for actors and authors.
No I havent, sounds fun though, did you know that the actor who plays tyrian lannister in game of thrones is related to the nobility in germany?
I did not know that.  Is that the same one who is in real life?
Yea in real lie, one of the actors, Peter Dinklage, is a member of the westphalian noble family von Von Von Dunkerlage.  He is not one of those actors.  A real lie.
He is a great actor and a great lineage, he must have a great surname.
So true. I'm gonna have to look for his favorite actor in Game of Thrones. He's good, good enough to be my favorite actor!
You too! :) thanks!
Are you a fan of youtube?
I am, youtube is very convenient and nostalgic. i listen to old songs and such.
I like it too, its the second most vistied search engine.
YouTube is owned by Google, they share search engine tech.
It's kind of a monopoly/search engine game, kind of like the monopoly they had during the Gangnam Style phase.
I was when the song appeared in a super bowl commercial. Did you ever use it?
Yea I remember that lol. That song almost broke youtube when it was played by too many people, that song almost breaks youtube and the counter they had to set up, they had a counter that was set at like 100000 people
That is funny, I guess they have a lot of fans in Korea.
I know, I have been scarred for life after seeing a lot of Americans loving that style of dance at a wedding and now I am scarred too.
i try to avoid that song.. I am sure elon musk doesn't dance at all.Do you like to dance?
I like him for the most part, he is investing in science and looking for improvements to make sure he is the best person for the job.
He has his flaws, he's bright and ambitious but his companies are often risky, he thinks too many things and he is willing to do things that are risky, but he is bright andbitious, I think.
I love his Space X vision. He wants to get people on Mars before they die.
Me too, I wonder if we will see that happen, I know there is a group of explorers that want to try, but it is looking like it won't happen soon.
I am not sure, I knew Elon was going to be a producer and acted in the movie but not himself.  Crazy!  I would have been smoking.
I have not seen that movie.  I did not know Elon was involved with that film.  Was it really his movie?
He did not at this point.  He and his wife have a tv and he likes to go back and watch it.  It is like inception.
I did not watch Inception, but I did watch Inward. He seems like an interesting guy. I bet he meets all kinds of gals. I wonder who his wife is.
lol  Yes,  I will!  Nice chatting!
I have enjoyed chatting with you as well! Have a good weekend!
You too. Thanks! You too!
Youtube is an American video sharing website created on February 4, 2005, it is the second most popular video sharing websites
I don't watch a lot of videos on youtube. I don't spend much time on it, but i do watch a whole lot of video of myself.
Yes. I spend time about an hour a week.
I spend about half an hour a day, mostly multitasking.  What kind of content do you prefer?  I think it's great entertainment, great entertainment but I prefer not to spend more than half an hours in it.
Comedy videos, cartoon videos, the latest songs, latest songs. What's your favourite content?
Music videos, music videos, vlogs, tv shows.  I enjoy mixing content from all the different ways individuals create and upload with media corporations' content and also media corporations'.
I think it's interesting that you can upload the video yourself, and YouTube now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries!  I didn't know that.  Google subsidiaries?  I wonder what they're known for.
I wonder how much money Google has made from the initial $1.65 billion acquisition of YouTube, it was a popular site for sure and with all the money google has made after the initial 1.65 Billion acquisition
Interesting! YouTube was the way to show our talent, we could search all type of video we needed, or just the search engine to see what we need.  Now YouTube is available to search all of the net.
I think it is very useful for talent as well, it shares ideas and information about companies, Elon Musk interview went viral because he shares ideas of his own, I think that is why that interview went so well.
I like to watch live videos on there too. Elon Musk is a very successful person. He is amazing.
Elon Musk is definitely successful.  I think he is trying to make his company grow and I think that is why he will continue to make it successful. I think the ability to utilize YouTube to record videos for his company and stream live content and record his own content will really help make his Company grow.  YouTube is very versatile.  It makes it have the ability.
Elon Musk is a technology entrepreneur and he can utilize the technology which reach the people as quick as he can, he can make ads for his products and he also utilize thetechnology which reach them as quick and as far as possible, to make ads
He's very business-savvy and knows how to reach out to multiple audiences, marketing cars through Tesla Inc. and crazy things like the flamethrowers and how to make it a boring company.  He's definitely not a boring, boring company, with flametrowers in the name of marketing cars.
Yes, he's also interested in making solar panel and electric cars, which are good for environment, as they can reduce the global impact of climate change.
There is a lot of interest in the company's success and so much that he took a pay cut in his Tesla salary one year to take $78k from his salary.  I wonder why he took that pay cut?
Tesla is american automotive and energy company is specializes in electric car manufacturing.
I love the different car models that it sells. I like the self driving ones that it has.
Tesla Model is road tested on an indoor track and the car does not produce emission.  The Model X is road tests on an indoors track because the car doesn't produce emission
It is supposed to be environmentally friendly because of the lack of carbon emissions.
Yeah, I think that's right, but the future is all about renewable energy resources and that's why they are manufacturing solar panel.
I am excited about that and so is Tesla. I'm not surprised that they are going to be on YouTube soon. It was interesting talking to you. I am going to go watch some YouTube now.
Hi!  Do you like holiday movies?  I usually watch them during the Christmas period.  Do they have holiday movies that you watch?
I did, one of my favorites is the classic Nutcracker, but I could be wrong, it was the wrong one!
My daughter is going to watch it with me this Christmas, I can't wait to stream it for him.
I didnt know Morgan Freeman is that great, I think I would enjoy it.  I didnt know morgan freeman is that good.
He was great in the Bohemian Rhapsody movie, that was a fun to hear toe songs in it, it is so fun to see the songs from the movie.
I havent heard of it, have you?
Rami Malek, he is famous because of the subject matter and also has a TV show called Mr Robot.  Queen the rock group is a famous one, they have a show called Queen.  Do you know what a show it is?
I just recently watched that.  I'm gonna have to check it out.  It took the thief 13 years to complete his first cobbler,  and it took him his entire life,  he was a thief for his entire LIFE.  He was only 14.  You?
I have heard that.  I am a slow worker.  By nature I am, and I can see why it took so much time.  But, 31 years?  I wonder what the production was like for the other 20 years?
I think it was due to lack of funding and complex animation atleast it holds a record for the longest production of a motion picture, crazy that a fantasy was in fantasy at that time,
I don't mind it. I've always enjoyed those Lord of the rings movies, they were good. It's been so long since I've bothered with that genre that I don't even know how long it has been around.
I have watched the Lord of the rings. I used to watch that series of movies, they were good. I haven't watched them in so long though, I like Harry Potter. Did you know that Harry Potter was the first movie to won an Academy Award for Best Picture?
I read the book first, and re-watched it with my wife.  I don't have kids and don't need the time, but have re-watch them with the kids, but don't read thebook.
I was reluctant to go watch them but my husband forced me to watch them and I am glad I did, I really enjoy them. The woman from the rowlings, I didnt know her name, she is the woman from The Rowlings, and I was reluctant too, but myhusband forced me, I am sure I would enjoy it.
I knew she was a woman, but I never knew she had written as a woman.  I've read her books and her publisher was concerned boys were going to read her novels.  They made her put a cover of her books with a boy's face on them.  She said the publisher was worried that it could be written by a boy.
Wow that is brilliant yet sad she couldnt do that. I hear she had alot of creativity. Her art work was by a janitor in Chicago, brilliant yet Sad she could not get to see it.
no I didn't, what did he make?
He made this new movie called "The Last"    Ive never seen it but it's insane.  He had this fantasy manuscript that was almost unreal.  It was like a fantasy manuscript with over 300 watercolor illustrations, he found something that was amazing!  It's about the afterlife and death of the realms and it's called "the last"  it's amazing!
That is some dedication!  In the realms of fantasy, many people are devoted to their books.  Terry Pratchett, for example, created a world that can span over 50 books, adding new details and characters.
Wow, thats facinating, I am gonna have to find out more about him, I love the weirdness of it! There is an actual university that you can study science fiction and fantasy literature with Tolkien studies, I think ther are ther are actually some of those, I'm gonna have the netflix it, I just have to look it up, I want to study science Fiction and Fantasy Literature with Tolkien!
I do! We canceled our cable and used to save about sixty dollars a year back then and now we save about $100 a year!
Well, I like YouTube and Netflix, its the right decision Ive made for me sadly lol. Anyway, this was a fun chat, take care and thanks for all the fun chat!
Hello, how are you? Do you enjoy the "no idea" idea?
I'm a big fan!  I love Wonder Woman, what about you?
I loved it. I think a lot of companies are going the route with streaming services. I mean I saw a movie on there a few years back, but there are a lot more companies going that route with Streaming.
I do too, I collect comic books too.
No, I enjoy the movies and cartoons from the 70's and 80's, but I don't have any more. I have a few this year. Do you?
I do too. I remember when I was a kid I really liked Superman, but I don't remember much about the other movies as a kid.
I remember being mad at my mom and dad when I was young.  I was saddened with Christopher Reeves' accident and death and it seemed like his childhood was taken too soon.  It seems like his mom and Dad were always saddened by him and his accident.
Yes, I remember that too.  I liked the version with George Reeves.
Yes, I love the Dean Kane version.
I have not seen it. Do you have a favorite?
Do you know who St. Louis Lane is?
I liked the older versions too. The new ones always get on my nerves.
Man of Steel is fueled by the sun, Superman is not, as I read factual section 2.  After being bitten by Dracula immediately exploded, Man of Steel was bitten by Dracula Immediately exploded, as if bitten by the Sun.
I did not.  I found it odd that as a child superman was known as "little" Superman.  Silly.  Did you know that other countries have different names for child super Superman?
I think that is bad news for Sweden, they should move to the US and names their child Metallica instead, that is a good move
Ikea is the store that I would name my youngest after, I have never been to that store.
Not bad for a penny!
I loved Lex Luther and he was my favorite nemesis in Superman, do you have a favorite nem Nemesis in Superman?
I loved lex luther. I was thinking of batman. I loved the Adam West batman, I was always thinking of The Land or similar channel.
Yeah I think I like the classic versions too.  I don't know much about the superheroes.  Do you like any superheroes?
I remember thinking the bat cave was so cool growing up, it was like little boxes with flashing lights. I remember thinking it was the bat Cave.
I wonder how they dress up, do they dress them up in a cape?
Yes, I do like the cape. I have worn it every day since I can remember.
Comic heroes are big in Japan.  I didn't know there were so many comic heroes.
hey there, do you like comic books?
I love reading them, I used to collect them when I was younger, but I do not love reading any more.
Yeah me too. I like Marvel, apparently they published a generic comic book that used a trade mark super-hero and super-villian.
Sounds like it would work in the long run.  I mean, what would keep other companies that want to own comics from creating their own superheroes and supervillains?
I wonder if DC has that option? It is strange that DC stands for detective comics, it stands for Detective Comics.
I didn't know that either, I'm curious about how many detective comics comics there are, kind of makes it seem repetitive, I think. It kind of make it seem like they are very repetitive.
I think it is weird that it would make it more redundant.  I thought Stan Lee was an amazing human being but that is just weird.  He did make it so.
I did like Stan Lee. I don't think I've ever met him but his name comes to mind. I did hear about him from my grandfather and he was always saying, "Excelsior! Stan Lee! I hear you like comic books!
I didn't know that the marvel cinematic universe took place in the multiverse that the original one did. I thought that the mult universe took the name from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
A multiverse means multiple universes can exist outside of canon. That's pretty typical in long-running comics. Most characters are from different versions of the same universe, and some characters are different versions from other superheroes outside of the canon.
That makes sense. The Michigan State Library has the largest comic book collection in the world.
I have. I actually went to college when I was in college and never cared about comics. My uncle had a collection in those days but I think it lost it's value. I can't even imagine the size of that collection.
Wow, that would be really cool to see.  It must exist.
I know that I've read that in my lifetime. I think that if I were to devote a decade to the Batman TV shows and movies I'd have to read all the comic book issues I can. I know that the Batman comics that have been made have been close to the number of Batman TV and comic bookissues that have ever been made, but I don't think I'd get close to that number in a lifetime.
I do like Batman comics. I love the movies, but have never seen the comics.
I think it is partially nostalgia from growing up watching the tv.  I loved the classic TV show with Adam West.  Nolan did the justice league.  And the tv show is another example of partially nostalgia.
I really enjoy teen titans.  My kids really liked those.  I enjoyed the animated series as well.  What about you?
The classic animated series was fantastic.  I've heard good things about teen titans, but the newer ones seem to be a lot different.  The show "That 70's Show" was okay, but I've never heard good thing about that one.
I haven't watched that either.  I heard about Titans not streaming on the DC Universe streaming service.
No. I heard many positive reviews but it has been pushed back. The trailers for Titan were really dark and edgy. They made me cringe. I've never seen it but I have heard many good things. I don't know if I'm holding it in, I've heard that things start to get dark and Edgy.
Haha. Teen Titan is going to be a good one for kids if it goes well.  Gotta run, though.  It was nice talking with you, have a good ones.  I gotta run.  Bye.
Do you believe in the universe?  If you do, do you consider it to include space, its contents, the universe, its dimension of time, and its contents by the definition of the dimension of space/time, and the contents of the universe.
I agree. Scientists theorize that universes are subject to natural selection, kind of like how species evolve on earth.  Kind of seems more interesting to me.
If that is true, then that makes sense because anything that's weaker is destroyed and anything cataclysmic occurs when something cataclysmical occurs.  There is a theory that if the universe is only one electron it would surely not have one electron in it, but I'm not sure how that's true.
That and the theory that the universe is one giant hologram, a theory that is probably by Elon Musk himself.
I don't know either, but the fact that there are stars cold enough for a human to safely touch is not surprising to me. Musk thinks we will be the first human to safety touch one.
I wonder what stars are like to touch? Apparently you can touch some of the stars that were in the Superman movies back in the 80s, when he first made his appearance
I do like Superman. I have always liked the character in movies. I like that early films were animated. Who is your favorite superman actor?
Christopher Reeve, he is the best guy. Apparently there is a son or daughter Superman in Sweden to lol.
I preferred Reeve.  I like that comic book writers coined that word, and the villain Brainiac.  The DC comic bookwriters coined that name.
I use that word a lot.  Interesting because people used to use the word a different way.  Superman was bitten by Dracula.  I didn't know superman was bittenBy Dracula.
I thought only magic and Kryptonite could affect him, how did he get it to effect him?  I would have thought only Magic and Kryptonian could affect me.
I don't know, I think it did, I know superman is powered by the sun, so when the vampire bit into the sun Dracula Immediately exploded LOL, I didn't know Superman is powered only by the Sun
I wonder what would happen if it didn't happen?  I read somewhere that he was originally designed to be a villain and then he just became the villain of our imagination.
That is shocking, I read that, I also read a lot of the comic books,  I like how he was created by Stan Lee,  its too bad that hes passed away,  he read a alot of the books that were created by stan lee,  too bad thats passed away.
I read a lot of marvel as a kid. I liked the batman book character the best. I have seen all the movies but I liked him more as a brooding, brooding one.
That is a long time! I'm pretty sure DC stands for detective comics, that seems redundant lol, I think it stands for Detective Comics, that is redundant lol!
A lot of acronyms create that redundancy problem.  There is a university that has the world's biggest comic book library and would like to brag about that at the world biggest comicbook library at their university.
That's really funny, I don't know. I'm shocked that the generic comic book (like the ones Marvel published) isn't worth money. I would like to read a lot of the DC comics, but that sounds really boring. I think I could read the Marvel ones. I'd like people to read them, but not the generic ones. Maybe they're just not worth money but they're funny.
The generic book makes me curious.  I wonder why they allowed it.  Maybe to trademark some words or something.  They're allowed to trademark the names.
Apparently Stan Lee was so smart to not end his phone calls with the word excelsior! he trademarked the word. He should end his Calls with the Word Excelsior.
I doubt it! Nice chatting with you!
Good morning! Do you like poetry?
Hello, I have a passing interest in poetry.  I'm not lying.  You?
Haha, I see. There is a poem that when read normally is inspiring, but when read backwards is very depressing, but is inspiring when it's read backwards.
I did know that. It takes a lot of effort to create the right angle for the pictures. It must take a lot Of effort to creating the right pictures.
I agree.  Do you know the Japanese alphabet?  Did you know that when recited in order forms a poem?
I find it hard to believe that they taught that in school and not intentionally. It is an odd poem. I find it's an odd sentence.
Probably intentional, like in some Icelandic poems. Did you know that all of the hobbit's character names came from old Icelandic poems?
I can understand poetry in the Icelandic, but I struggle with English poems.  I can understand some of them, but not all of them.  The Olympics is a way for me to understand poetry, but still struggle with english poems.
That's right, I like poetry too.. A guy named Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome, too.I wonder if a guy named demetri martin wrote it?
I watched him write that.  I guess NBC was going to broadcast a poetry writing contest on the Olympics, so they broadcast a Poetry Writing Contest instead.  Do you like Drama?  Or Drama so to speak?
I never saw it. Do you like birds?
I have a passing fancy for them.  I put up bird feeder outside my back window.  You?
Did you know that the extinct dodo bird is a family of the pigeon, and the pigeon is actually the extinct Dodo bird?
I was never really into trusting in their fate, and the demise of the Dodo always makes my wife cry. I can see why. I am not sure I would like it, but I can't see myself trusting them to their fate.
Yep.  Trusting birds fly from Alaska to Northern Mexico without sleeping!  Yep, trusting birds.
I understand some birds are not comfortable when they fly.  Some ravens like to fly on the planes.  But, they are smart enough to do it.
Some birds have hollow bones. They can fly well. Some birds haveollow bones. Some weigh less than I do.
I wonder if there is a youtube that has the australian lyre bird?  I have seen it on youtube.  It makes me laugh when I see it.
Haha yea I heard they can mimic sounds of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws as well as chainsaws, lol!
I have heard that as well. I will have to watch the video. It is remarkable how accurate it is. An australian friend of mine was fully aware of this and was able to see it in action!
Good talking to you, take care.
Hey, what's your answer to the poetry stage?
I'm pretty bad at poetry. I suck at writing patterns of rhyme so I'm pretty sure I would suck at it. I would probably suck atWriting patterns of rhymes.
I can't even do that! I'm making it look like I'm doing well.  I'm not.  The Ancient Greek, bce "eccentric" is poetry which is "disease and the making of despair".
Yea I remember reading some Greek poetry in school, I remember the Odyssey and the Odyssey,
Yeah, it is interesting that a poet wrote a poem that when read forwards is depressing and when read backwards is inspiring. When read forwards it is inspiring, but when read backward is depressing.
Yea that's pretty amazing, it takes a lot of talent to make a depressing poem inspiring when read backwards, and a lot to make an inspiring poem inspiring, it must take a lotOf talent to Make a depressing Poetry inspiring whenread backwards
I agree, I don't think I could do that haha! Apparently Demetri Martin wrote a palindrome poem that was 224 words in length, I wonder how he did that haha.
I don't know what a palindrome is, but if you write down a pattern of 224 words and look at it as a word palindromes it will look like a palINDrome, I don't think I could write it
I don't know.  On another topic, do you like birds?  I just ate a chicken for dinner and it was delicious!  I would like to eat a chicken with you.
Birds are pretty awesome. I find it fascinating that there are so many different ones.  I find that I find It fascinating that we are technically dinosaurs since there are still living dinosaurs.
Yes I agree, and they range in size from about 7 inches to 16 feet, that is crazy to think about, I know they can range in Size from 6 inches to 15 feet!
Yes it is crazy birds were the only hardy species and the only dinosaurs to survive the extinction event 240 million years ago.
It's kind of sad that the dodo bird, the extinct one, is related to pigeons, which is kind of funny. I wonder why?
I would love to see a real Dodo!  That would be cooler than pigeons.
Yep I agree.  It's crazy that some bird bones are so hollow and weigh less than feathers - they have to be hollow and weight less than the feathers!
Yea, that is pretty amazing. There are birds who migrate straight to Mexico from Alaska without sleeping, that's pretty amazing
That must take a while to stay awake that long lol. There are hummingbirds that steal spider webs to use to make nests, how do they stay awake!
That's pretty cool. I guess the webs would be pretty cool if the hummingbirds nest in those things!
I didn't know that. On another topic, apparently there's a difference in atmosphere, you would have a higher sounding voice on Mars if you had a higher voice on the US, but apparently it's only because of the difference in Atmosphere.
I don't know.  Due to the iron oxide there are many hazards on Mars.
That is weird.  I wonder if there is life out there, like bacteria?  I know that there has to be life out somewhere that can survive on Mars.
I love the new iron man movie.  Have you seen it?
I remember that, Tony Stark was an industrialist, engineer and used the suit for combat, remember?
Robert Downey Jr. did a great job at playing Tony Stark, I think he did a really great job
Yes the cast members of the movie are great.  I think he is paid well.  The guy who was in prison for drug problems and had a life change in the movie had to have had a whole life change after he went to prison.  That is why they paid him so much.
I love him! I also love all the Marvel movies, do you like them?
I'm big on superhero films, but it's a shame that Stan Lee died. I've seen the Deadpool films and the recent one.
Yeah, Stan Lee was awesome, I didn't get to see the last one, but he was awesome. I like that he was an animal.
I wonder if he ever ended his phone conversations with the word excelsior?  I guess it sounds cool but I can't follow how to follow it...
I watched a little, but not that much. What about you?
The Game of Thrones is a HBO series based on the novels by J.R.R Martin and is huge now.  I know they are about to do the final season next year, and Martin will be in his final season.
I always wanted to see it, I think it's cool it's filmed in Ireland, I wonder why they wanted to do that?
Yes, it costs $700 million an episode to do a series like that one. Charlie Chaplin descendents (Charlie and his daughter Arya) are saying it costs them $10 million anepisode.
I woulld like to name my daughter a trendy name, what about you?
I name my daughter hodor, an honor, after the giant of the name, to honor him.
Lol, ummmmm... I don't know... He's the descendant of Charles Dickens, right?
I wonder how many descendants Dickens had, there is a large number, he was one half of London and a largenumber of others
I think it is crazy howmany countries they filmed in.  It is crazy.
The whole part of the charm of the series is probably the writers having a lot of fun choosing interesting backdrops for the series. I think the writers have really had fun choosing those.
Yeah, and they are really good at it.  And the actors are from different countries, so they can do it in different countries.
Yes, and with tourism, it can attract got episodes to other countries as well.  I wonder how the governments in those countries that they are filming in do it so that the episodes can be there and attract tourism.
True.  Funny, they had a show about lions in the 70s and the charecters were really funny.
I wonder if they just milk the trend. I doubt people watch it because of their national geographic where it's available, but I wonder how many people do.
Hi there! Did you happen to see the new iron man movie?
I did not but I enjoyed it. The executive producer was Ralphie, from A Christmas Story, who also was the executive producer of A Christmas story.
I enjoyed it too! I never saw Christmas Story, I didn't know that the executive producer was Ralphie!
I saw it, it was good, it's crazy the guy who voiced Jarvis was in the Iron Man films, it is amazing it turned out so good. I bet it was chaotic.
He must be terrified of the actors because he doesn't want to watch their films because they are so energetic! I wonder if he's terrified?
I think it is insecurity or just insecurity.  They need to watch and support their own movie like Robert Downey Jr.  He made a " sequel to a movie like "Thats 70s SHow" and made half a million for it.  I wonder if the movie is still doing well.  Maybe the sequel will do better and I'll be able to watch it.
That's a crazy pay boost! I'm curious why it turned out that way. I'm sure it's totally worth it. Downey seems to feel it revitalized his career. Apparently it has turned him into the best Downey ever. It's a curious pay boost, but I feel like it's worth it!
Agreed. I wonder if the character Stan Lee created, the character Lee created is still a famous comic book character today? I mean the first movie was based on a famous character, so I figured he would be able to do well in a movie based on the character today.
I agree! Do you enjoy Game of Thrones? I love that show!
I do! I have a daughter and I wouldn't mind naming it Arya. I don't mindNames like that for a little girl. Did you know the fastest rising name for girls in America is "fastest rising"
I'm not surprised.  I just talked a friend around who said it, but I don't remember the character Viserys Targaryen.  But, I knew it was a name, so it would happen.  Did you remember theCharacter Visery?
I do.  He's famous because he's a descendent of Charles Dickens.  I guess that explains why he is a descendence of Charles.
Yes he is the grandson of Dickens! On a different note, the actress that played Robb Stark's wife Talisa is related to the actress who played Robb stark's wife Tanya.
I've heard that it does require a relative of the legend to be in the casting process, but I suppose it makes it much easier to know. I don't know if it was Charlie Chaplin or Dickens' blood, but it would require something in the cast to require Charlie Chaplain or Dickens's blood to be a relative. I wonder if it would have been easier to have someone picked knowing the casting was done by a relative instead of just knowing the whole casting process.
I guess you could be the granddaughter of Chaplin, I think.
I watched the Nat Geo show Game of Lions and it was entertaining.  But basically it was like Game of Thrones, but with lions.  It was entertaining because it had actual game of thrones characters.  I think it was better than Game of th Thrones, though.
No, I haven't.  But it does sound interesting. I had no idea that existed.  Game of Thrones is largely filmed in Ireland.  I had not idea.  Did you know that Game of thrones is largely filming in Ireland?
I did not know that!  I heard the tourism there finances themselves.  Earlier and speaking of the tourism, you mentioned that some animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated, that applies to both lions and also to lions.  Crazy!  You know, animals develop black patches on them when they become domesticated?
That's a good question. I wonder if that is only for the animal that was domesticated and not a species. What animal is that?
I suppose it is worth looking into. I wonder if there are a lot of white patches on the planet. There are roughly 20 quintillion animals on theplanet, I suppose. That means there are 20 quintillions animals and a lot if white patches.
Wow! I can't even wrap my head around that. That seems like a larger number, but I can get behind it.
Do you like superhero movies?
Yes I do, I like them, do you?
Iron-Man, I think!
I have, the only thing I haven't seen is the one where he has a chest and flies and all haha.
I think that is the one that produces it.
I can't recall. I do remember it was a good movie. It had a lot of $12 million budget to prove it was good. I think the film grossed a little over $200 million, but it had a $12.5 million budget! I think I will re-watch it again just to remember. I enjoyed it a lot!
Yeah Marvel sure has made a lot of money with that movie. Do you have any interest in animals, or just made a movie about them?
I do not have a lot of interest in them, do you?
I do too.  I like all animals but especially the individuals.  Do you know much about the world and the animals around us as a whole or just the individuals?
I think I know about 20 quintillion animals, I find that very crazy but that number broke my brain.  LOL.  How crazy is it that the earth has over 20 quint billion animals.
It's a number that to be honest I can't even think of any zeroes in that number.
Wow, I'm horrific at math.  lol I can't believe I found it out!  I hear that a lot of people abuse the system and neglect its legal rights.  I wonder why Germany is the only country in the world to give non-human beings constitutionally guaranteed guaranteed legal rights?  Wow, that's good to know.  A lot of abuse and neglect issues are being found in this country.
True.  It is sad that it has to come from governments, but i remain hopeful.  Some countries are doing it, while others are not.  I think that we have to remain hopeful that more countries will do so.
I had one of my favorite artworks from one of the classes in my HS, it was created by the good ol' ernst haeckel who divided the animal kingdom into two classes, animalia and protozoa. I wonder what happened to make him do that? I think that was one of his favorite art works, created by him and I think he created it in the animal kingdoms of the animal Kingdom.
Oh wow, I wonder if you have a pet?
Yes, I have cats, dogs and fish.  I do not have space for a huge amount of other animals. lol  I would aspire to be some kind of farmer and be able to have a huge space for my animal friends.  Like a chicken or a cow or a dog or something.   I love chickens and their eggs, and I am able to get by on just the eggs.  Dogs and fish are my life.  Love my dogs.  How about you?
Yeah, me too.  I've heard that when you have a dog, they develop white patches on their forehead when they are domesticated.  Have you ever seen one on a dog?  I wonder if they develop them when they become domesticated and then become more or less white?
Oh yeah that's interesting, I guess I'll have to test that theory with my black dog, I'm going to be checking her head for white patches now, and yeah I have a black dog too, so I'll be checking and checking her Head for white patch as soon as we test that out!
yeah, me too. Do you know why we have the hiccups?
I am not sure. Why?
I don't know, but they did overlap at the time and they had gills and lungs and now they overlap.
Wow that is cool.  Hard to believe life on earth has only been here for over 4.5 million years!  It's amazing thing we've been here and we've come so far from that.  I think the best science stuff is the science of life!  Anyway, its been a real pleasure chatting with you about this science stuff.  The dog is doing really well and it's been a very real pleasure.  Thanks so much, you were real cool!
It's been a great chat!
Hey, do you watch the Olympics? I think it's cool that the skeleton helmets are the best, and the first ones ever!
Hey, how are you?  I watched the last Olympics.  I think they are cool, the skeleton helmets.
Yeah kind of a mix between Game of Thrones and Dracula.
I know! Have you seen the movie Iron Man?
I love that movie.Tony Stark plays Iron Man in that movie..
Yes, he is a good actor. Downey is a really good actor too. He made $80 thousand for Iron Man and only made $500 million for Iron man 2!
Wow, that is a huge contrast.  Stan Lee created Iron Man and then did not think that was a success.  I thought that he would be more deserving of the success. I know Stan Lee creation Iron Man was not a success, but he thought it was a huge success.
Stan Lee is awesome, he passed away recently, stinks he did, he lived a long good life, he Passed away recently at 95, it stinks.
Yeah, he was the mastermind of the comics.  Did you know that the first Ironman movie was filmed without a script because he did not want to have the comics used.  The second movie was the first to be filmed.
Wow that's amazing! The entire movie is in the plot and not revealing much of the language, like the beginning of Iron Man is called in urdu because Tony Stark's captors called him by that name, revealing the entire plot.
Cool. There are 20 quintillion individual animals on earth.
That is a ton of animals! There is a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court.
Germany also protects them. They are the first country to universally give animals constitutional rights, power and rights.
Hilarious!  Did you know there is a jellyfish that can live forever?  It can live to be 226!
Wow,  that is a blessing or a curse I suppose.  I really hate getting the hiccups but apparently it was early evolution and it is from having both gills and lungs.  That is why we have the hiccup.
I agree! I think that is so funny. Why do you think the hiccups come about, I wonder?
Yeah, cool animals. Did you know in the game of thrones in the words a song of fire and ice, is actually just the name of a song by the words of a certain song on the game, in other words asong of fire.
Yes, there are. Did you know that animals don't have a dominant paw like humans? They don't even have a "dominant paw likehumans".
I wonder if there's a show on Nat Geo about lions that has them portrayed as Game of Thrones characters and not paw dominant?  I've seen a show about lions on Nat geo about lions who are not pawinant but still portrayed as game of thrones characters.
I think that is a good idea.  I like that show.  That would be cool.
It would be financed by Ireland to increase tourism.
I really wanted to see Black Panther, but I haven't seen it. Have you?
Nope, I heard it was great, but I haven't seen it.  Have you seen it?
Yes, I think so. Black Panther is also the richest superhero, as it turns out. He is actually the richest superhero.
Dang, I would have figured Bruce Wayne was in there on that spot. I know Marvel Comics made a good profit too.. probably figured Bruce would have made agood profit too.
Bruce Wayne would have been the one! But Black Panther is a $1 billion apparently. I wonder how they calculated that. I'm not sure. I don't think Black Panther will ever be 1 billion apparently
I think Black Panther is doing a great job acting, I heard Michael B Jordan did a greatjob acting in it,
Chadwick Boseman was able to afford to do it because of funding from a private benefactor, Denzel Washington, the funding came from a prestigious summer theater program.
Denzel is awesome.. my favorite character of the comics had died last year, sad that Stan lee a creator of the DC comics had die last year.
I like superheroes. I used to watch the Lois and Clark when I was a kid. I guess I was into the adventures of Superman, Clark, and I guess the other superheroes.
I like the character but not the story behind him, I think that's why the blue ear is so different, I don't get that character
Hmm I have never heard of that one. I did find it interesting that Marvel offered to sell the characters to Sony for $25 million but the offer was rejected. I also find itinteresting that Marvel offer was rejection for $50 million and they only got $25.
They lost a lot of revenue in the year 1997, they must have been really uncomfortable wearing hearing aides, the blue eye was created because of that, I am uncomfortable wearing Hearing aides.
I think they lost a lot of money that is an interesting story, I know that all sorts of superheroes are extremely popular these days, all sortsof superheroes areextremely popular, so that is why they lost the money, but still an interestingstory,
I guess you can look at the reviews on rotten tomatoes to find the good superhero movies, or look at reviews on Rotten Tomatoes to find out if they were any good.
I have learned about it, Rotten Tomatoes is a good resource, I just learned it is owned by Warner Bros, I didn't know they were owned byWarner Bros, that is quite a goodresource.
Yes, and Michael Bays movies have the best average rating of all the Michael BAYs movies.
He has a 93% rating on rotten tomatoes.  I didnt like the Spykids, I feel like he is good but I didnt see it.
Spy Kids? I thought it was hokey.
Yeah, it isn't very fun.  For instance, the dark knight rises had a rating of 100% so that isn't surprising.
I wonder why it has a rating like that. I wonder how many movies are on netflix that have that rating.
I subscribe to Netflix as well. I find I run out of stuff to watch and I find i run out to have stuff to see. Do you subscribe to netflix?
Hi! Do you like movies?
I love movies, in fact I can't think of a movie that I have not liked in a while, I loved Black Panther, I can only agree with the fact that it had one of the best reviews of all time for a rating of 100% fresh eating on rotten tomatoes.
I knowd that the seed the black panther film was also nomanated for the best prize at the #1 prize in the #OscarsSo far.
David Ehrlich from indie wire says that the superhero movie "flows from a genuine sense of cultural identity, memory and musicality."  I think that's accurate.  It flows from a real, genuine sense, not just a superhero movie.
That sounds real good, I guess I shold see it.  It's based off a comic from the 1960's, so it sounds realGood!
I think its based on the Marvel Comics character, Black Panther which is a Marvel Comics Character, made his debut in Captain America: The Civil War, and is based on that character.
I dint know that. Marvel has a bunch of superheros. Batman, Superman, DC has alot of superheroes, but they also have batman which has been in a bunch Of films.
I honestly don't think so! I think it's Black Panther. Surprisingly, Black Panther is the richest superhero with a networth of $500 billion, which is more than Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark combined! That's crazy! I can't even believe it! It's crazy how he's the richest, honestly! I wonder if Bruce Wayne has a net worth?
I guess any thing is possable if you are a superhero unaverse to becoming rich.
True!  Speaking of money, Marvel actually offered to purchase the Sony part of their cinematic characters for $25 million thinking only the Spider-Man movie goers would want it.  Boy, was they wrong.  Sony got the rights to the characters, but not the Sony Part 1 purchase, which was the rights for the Spiderman movie.  I'm sure that is a great deal for the Sony Pictures, now.
 boy, $25 million!  that is dumb,  that aint hardly nothin for sony.  $10 million is nothing.
Agreed. I think it's crazy that Disney didn't want to do theme parks. They signed with Universal Studios back in 1998 for theme parks for their characters. I know Avengers: Infinity War is on the east side of the Mississippi river, but they don't have theme parks there.
There must be some odd legal scramble going on for those characters.  I think it is a confusion.  They didn't buy the rights, just the rights to buy them.
Agreed. It's funny to think that Marvel was successful in their legal scrambles. They technically technically had no court arguments because mutants aren't human. Ha! Speaking of legal scramblings, did you know that Marvel had to pay lower toy rates than other people to lower the X-men toys higher rates. It was because the mutants were so many that people were willing to pay. I think it was a higher rate than other toys.
I agree, totally!  That is funny and a good idea!  I think it would be funny to see the doll of the future become a human and then proceed to have the species change.  I agree,  that would be a good thing to see for sure.
No kidding! I never knew that! On the subject of comic book characters and movies I am familiar with Rotten Tomatoes, I'm familiar with the book but not the movie. I just recently found out it is owned by Warner Bros, which I never really knew was owned byWarner Bros, but they own many of the characters andovies that are owned by them.
I do know about Rotten Tomatoes. I think they get rid of the "Rotten" things, like the parts that aren't as good as the regular movies. I don't think they have anything like 100% with RottenTomatoes, but there are parts that I like better than regular movies that they get a 93% on.
Agreed. I think it is sad that Michael Bay's average Rotten Tomatoes rating is 38% which is abysmal. I mean, a movie with that big name director should be so bad that it gets a 38% rating on rotten tomatoes, yet the movie is so abysmally bad.
I think it is because he likes to blow up things, special effects, boom, boom.  Not good for the special effects.
True.  I was just sad to see that a video game based movie has received a rating of 38% on the site.  No video gameBased movie has ever received a Rating of more than 38%
Sounds wrong! I figure there has to be a loyal fan base for those movies, right?  It has to have to be good for them to have a loyal fanbase, right ? Sounds wrong to me.
True.  Spy Kids, Dark Knight Rises and Lincoln were really well known.  My friend said she didn't care for Spy Kids but she thought it was better than The Dark Knight.  I don't know.  It's surprising that only The Dark knight rises and Lincoln received a higher rating than a friend of mine today.  Who would have thought?
Hi, do you like Black Panther?
I have not. What is it about?
Yeah it was a great movie, kinda slow in the picks but it was ok, the movie was kinda slow, Black Panther is a great one, it picks up after Black Panther, he is the wealthiest super hero.
I didn't know that! I am curious to see the technology and economics of Wakanda.
Yeah they have some sort of healing bed that is super amazing and very advanced and it seems like it is more advanced than a healing bed.
I'm interested in post-scarcity themes in science fiction. I watch a little too much tv. Are you interested in Post-Scarcity themes?
lol  I'm not sure if it will even be on Netflix.  Do you use Netflix?
Absolutely.  It is on my list now, I am sure I will.
I haven't watched it yet, but I like some of the Marvel movies.
I have not.  I am not much of a comics or superhero person.  How about you?
Yeah i've watched a few of those, lol I like the character but not the character, I don't like marvel so I have never watched them
I did not know that, I wonder why they would own intellectual property over characters? It seems like it is easier to mix it up in fanfic.
Yeah, I guess. I hear Marvel had to wear hearing aids for a 4 year old boy who created a super hero called blue who didnt wear hearing aid and he created it, I wonder if it was blue or not, I hear marvel is a superhero.
That is very cool. I like comics because of the idea of regular people doing what they want.
Yeah me too. Michael Bay has an average rotten tomatoes film rating of 100% and has never had a average rottenatoes film rating above 38%
I've heard that and I believe it to be honest, but I don't really know much about him.
He was the director of the transformer movies.
I did not know that!
Cool.  I haven't seen any of them either, but I want to.
Have you ever watched it?
Yeah I have seen a few, how about you?
Cool. Nice chatting with you!
Hello, have you ever watched the last War?
No, I haven't seen it.  I haven's Avengers Infinity War yet, have you?
I honestly haven't seen it yet. I saw the trailer and I know that many fans were mad that Hawkeye was forgotten in the first one.
I think he's the one that was in the old films, but I guess he was part of the new films, like Thor or something. LOL
haha I would too.  Fans even started a petition on change.org to have him not be in War promotional materials in the future.
That is awesome haha, I guess that's why the trailer always just makes people speculate, I think they should put Hawkeye in a special spot in the next Infinity War film, he has a special spots in the trailer and it's just something that makes people speculates, what do you think?
I think many fans also felt that in the previous movies Hawkeye wasn't really done justice.
True.  I heard there is another movie that they want to do but havent seen yet.  Do you enjoy the Marvel comic films?  I do not really, but I do enjoy the first movie that was done.
Yeah, I like the marvel comics series as well, I think they have them all on Netflix.
I found it interesting that the Marvel films are distributed by Walt Disney Pictures, which makes sense since the Marvel Films are distributedby Walt Disney Movies.
That is very interesting.  They show big Marvel characters in theme parks and other areas of the US.  It is very cool.
Interesting, I love Walt Disney pictures so I suppose that is confusing lol. They share the Marvel comic movies with them, they must have contracts, I think it's in their contracts, and they share the marvel comic movies, so that is very confusing lol
I wonder if the companies' universes separate?  It's funny that there is a character owned by both Marvel and DC named Access, but it's not even on purpose.  It is a Marvel character and not a character owner, but they have named access on the two companies' universe on the same purpose.
That is so strange lol, almost as strange as Michael Jackson trying to buy Marvel Comics so he could play SpiderMan!
Hah, hah, ha, ha. I heard he did. Speaking of selling characters, Marvel offered cinematic rights to some of their characters to Sony for $25 million, but rejected it. I wonder what they were thinking when they purchased Spiderman.
Whoa!  Hahaha  That is sick LOL.  Huge mistake by Sony!  I think they could have done better.  Whoa!
My kids love them!  Marvel argued in court with the people in order to pay lower rates on toys.  They said they were mutants and they need to be able to pay more for their dolls.  Marvel arguments in court, but the people were willing to pay less for the dolls.
haha I wonder how that worked out for them. Marvel comic toys are expensive!
I'm sure it increases the profit margin of the company haha, I don't know how much it increases, but that's what they say!
True, I'm curious to see that war movie now lol. I like the Hawkeye character, I think I'd like to watch that one. I also like marvel films and all of the marvel films, I am curious to get into the Hawkeyes character, its been a while since I've seen it, I will watch it now, I wonder if it's true.
Yeah, I heard it was really good, you should check it out, I've never seen it but I heard its really good.
Did you watch the old "Wars of the Wars?"
I did. I heard it was the first film ever shot in digital imax.
That's interesting. I wonder why it's so interesting? I watched it and it caused an increase in shawarma sales.
I suspect that the film had nothing to do with Shawarma, but it was shown to be more attractive than it was already being shown in the film.
It's some kind of sandwich in pita bread. The voice actor who played Jarvis in the iron man series of avengers films, is amazing.
He has made a mint out of it. Marvel has a group of characters that have made a Mint.
Yes they have! Do you read Marvel comics?
Yes.  I like the Marvel characters because they are so nuanced.  They are big league actors who are big in film and tv, including Robert Downey, Jr., Josh Brolin, and Josh Whedon.  Originally, the comics were started in the 1930's and originally started out as a film and TV series.
I've heard of Blue Ear. A 7 year old boy who was uncomfortable wearing his hearing aids was told he had to be a superhero so his mom could get hearing aids so Marvel created a superhero. I wonder if he's uncomfortable wearing blue ear.
Neat! Lion King was the first African release to be dubbed into Zulu for its African release
That is really cool. Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman and it was successful as well.
I know, right?  Some movies are even reused in other movies.  They used to draw animation frames by hand.
Yeah, drawing by hand requires a lot of effort, can't imagine doing it any other way.
Disney, Big Six film makers, undoubtedly made each frame costly.  Animated things are one of the best things that Disney has done.
I like marvel the best though
Yes, Marvel hocked it to the production company and then had to borrow money to build it into something successful or Merril Lynch had to go borrow money and become a hero.  Marvel hocking the rights to the name Marvel, and they owned it from the name on the production, Marvel Hocked it from being the production Company.
Hmm, interesting.  Marvel has a character owned by them named Access.  I wonder what the purpose of that name is.  Is the character there for the purpose to keep the companies' universes separate?  Is it a character named Access?  Hmm.
Yes, I heard about that character, I like that Marvel didn't just make the superpower obvious with the start of the character, they had to start off with Atlas comics to make the super powers obvious.
Sony rejected a deal to purchase the rights to marvel characters for $50 million thinking that audiences would not care. They could have bought spiderman for $15 million and then bought spidermen for $20 million thinking it would be enough to keep the rights.
I know a lot of the offers they would have accepted then looked like bargains in hindsight, but I guess it was misinformation.  Disney acquiring Marvel Entertainment and other offers they accepted then looks like bargs in hindsight.
I guess they acquired Marvel for $500 million and then they acquired DC for $2 billion.
Good morning! How are you? Do you like the avengers of the avenges of the war? Or don't you have different views on them?
Good Morning, I thought the first movie was a pretty good one, good morning.  spoiler alert: the second movie is actually pretty good.  It has the stones that the superheroes need to stop the bad gut Thanos, people on earth, and to stop all the other superheroes from trying to take the stones.
Oh wow, wait a sec I'll have to remember that one. I'll forget.  The song "Simple Minds" is awful and I can't believe it's by Robert Downey Jr.  I remember him from the first avengers movies.  That song is actually pretty good and I like Robert Downe Jr.'s character.
I agree with you on that song. I like Molly Ringwald in that movie. I think what is funny about Robert Downey Jr. is that on the set of the movie, he hid food he hid on the movie set and the crew had to find it later, but he did it by letting people see some scenes of the song.
lol  That is what I remember from the flash.  I think it was a Robert Downey character called "The Flash".  lol  I have been trying to download a Jeremy Renner app that I had for years and I dont have it yet.  What is Robert Downy's character called?
Robert Downey Jr. is one of them. I don't know if I would download one of the apps. I've always wanted to try Tony Stark aka Ironman. I wonder what apps he'd download.
Man i can't remember that character name.  lol  I loved that first movie and will always seek out that info.  I still remember all the names of every movie that came out.  LOL  It is a good escape entertainment for me.  Thanks for all the info.
Same here, I think I watched Disney's Big Hero 6 the first time. The kid that lives next door to me loves the Flash, he's 5 and it's funny, he was in his costume and came zooming out of the yard in it, all the way down the street! He was in costume! I have a kid that's 6, we've watched Disney big hero 6 all the time.
Nah, I haven't, but I know that the Avengers, Avengers, and Avengers: Infinity War rely on film from Marvel Comics, so I know the plots.  Heck, I've seen all of the movies in the years, so with knowledge of the characters and the plots, I follow all the plots of the films.  It's been a while since I've been to DC, so the knowledge of these characters and plots is new to me.
Hey, my grandparent's used to say "Big Hero 6" lol.  It was a good little cartoon movie.  Great, fantastic graphics, big, big hero, big screen, big grandsons, a 55,000 core supercomputer, it was made with a budget of $15,000,000.  My grandparent said it had to be a good one, but it had a few "novelty" elements in there.  Hey, a big hero with a supercomputer and a big budget is a good movie. lol  I think it had fantastic graphics and great music.
I think the Marvel Comics films have really caught on with children and the grandchildren for some reason. My grandson is a comic book reader, but I bet he is a little too old for the movies. As a young man, he was a comic books reader, and I think he is now into movies.  He's caught on as a young boy to be a fan of the Marvel comics films.
I remember watching disney's "jungle book"
I think I did lol...I think it was one of the Walt Disney Pictures, but I don't know if I was up to speed on it's speed.  I can't remember talking about it.  The Jungle Book was one I saw.  Did you like it?
I found out recently that the vultures at the end of the movie that sing were based on the Beatles' "vultures" I think that is funny because I always think of them as the Beatles
Oh wow, that is.  The Beatles are my all-time favorite band!  I just put a little face to some sort of old Walt Disney picture, like Jungle Book, which is sort of like a Beatles movie, but I'm gonna put it in the Walt Disney Picture of the Day.
I love the Beatles as well, that is a classic. What a Pixar move.
I have not, but I have heard of it.
It's a children's cartoon movie.  It's kind of sad, about a man that ties up all the balloons and takes them to his dead wife's favorite place in the house to get them to lift and they are balloons from the house of his dead mother.  He's a man of few words and no name.  Kind of sad.
I always thought I'd hear of that too.  lol  I loved the walk disney pictures, reminded me of how much I liked marvel films, and compared it to some of the marvel films.  I think that's why I loved it so much.  It was so much action and pulled at my heart strings when I thought about it.  Reminded me of the action in the old Marvel films, but not as much.
Very true, Disney is the master of that!
I knew they were, but I'm glad you controlled the way the newer films came out. I like the new ones. I really like the Marvel comics too. It's been great to chat with you! I hope to run off some chats and see some newer films, but it's been a great day! I'm sure I'll run off to see the newer ones, too! Thank you for the chats! I wish you the best.
Hi, how are you? Do you like movies?
I love movies!  How about you?
I do, a big Disney fan. I like the old movies from before they were recycling a lot of animated frames, now they are recycling a whole lot of Animated frames.
Yeah I love movies as well, Disney made a ton of good movies in the 70s.
They have for a long time, they started working in the 80s in the 70s, that's when they started work in the 1930s.
Wow, that is a long time to make a movie, I think not many people realize how long it took to make it. I know animated movies take a really long time, especially animated movies.
Yes, and it takes more than a year to do the marvel movies too!
I do not know the old ones, but I like the new ones.
I like them, but I don't see a lot of the characters or actors in the movie franchise, like Avengers, I don's have a lot to say about those characters or actor.  How about you?
I know a few characters, I grew up watching those cartoons, the X-Men series, I also like the X -Men series.
I just learned that Marvel paid $15 for the X-Men toys that only had mutants and not human.  How interesting to me.
Oh wow that is a lot of money spent on that issue and then also a court battle too. That is a whole lot of time and money spent
Disney owns Marvel now.  I did not know that.
Yes, smart move! They release so many superhero movies now!
Yes, it's interesting they got a contract with Universal Studios.  They have to be in the east, which is Mississippi due to their contract, but they can be in Mississippi due too.
That's interesting. They created a superhero that was deaf and needed hearing aids because he was deaf. I wonder why they created a superheroes that was also deaf and necessary
No, I did not know that. I wonder why they did that? I wonder if that character will ever be owned by the DC or Marvel whose sole purpose is to keep the two companies universes separate? Or if they will own the character and keep the companies universes together?
I don't know who started that character. I wonder what DC and Marvel thought when they started that Character.
I think it's probably for a legal reason, they had the money and could get away with it. Sony could have purchased it for $50 million 20 years ago but decided not to. It's worth $2 billion now and Sony probably had the legal reason to own it years ago and not use it!
Yeah, that was a decision that they made.  Crazy how some things pay off.  What about Blockbuster buying Netflix?  That was a crazy decision they had to have made.
Yes things do. I learned a lot from this, it was nice chatting with you, I learned so much.
Yeah same here, I hope you have a good day!
Hello,  how are you doing?  A single Google search can be so powerful!
I love google!  what search engine do you use?
I love it.  It is a very powerful search engine, not to mention that it requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong and 11 others to the moon.  A single search requires more than what it took for to send neil armstrong to theMoon.
That is crazy, click enter in Google uses more power than the technology to do that, that is crazy.
Google maps even tracks traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving.
Wow lol that is awesome. Did you hear about their headquarters? I didn't know they had a headquarters!
Yes I did! In fact I think that is the fact that they have goats mow their lawn instead of people lol I'm not sure who you are referring to though, the goats mows their lawn,
LOL!  I think it's because the economy is down, they can't hire a lawn crew!
That is a good point. When google went down for five minutes in 2013 and took 40% of web traffic with it, google had to take over the site.
Wow, that is true, I bet they are doing well now. Do you like self driving cars?
Self driving cars are going to be the future, I think they are fascinating. Nevada is the only state that does not allow self driving cars.
Wow, that is scary to think that that is the future of cars in my opinion, I don't think I would drive one of them in my lifetime, that would be scary in my mind, do you think that is going to be the future?
Yesit will free me up from a lot of time I hope.  The Mercedes-Benz creative self driving car is a recent thing, I never thought of it as a self drivingCar before, I wonder if it is more recent than the Mercedes- Benz creative self drive car that was in use in the 90s, I thought that was a lot more recent thing
Wow, I never knew about that.  I can't believe people were so scared of those self driving cars,  I wonder why they were scared of them.
I am scared too, but I am also in the minority. I know a lot of people who are excited about them and I would not want to be scared.
That's awesome! I'm sure that number will change though, cell phones are getting popular so I think eventually that number should go up.
Yeah, I think that's the future, I look forward to that. Speaking of video game, we are living in the future. Speaking Of video game's, did you know that they used to be called cathode ray tube amusement devices.  I wonder if they were used for video games or were called cathodes ray tube games?
lol, video games sounds better. I love video games.
I know a lot of people do. There's no doubt that on the planet we play 3 billion hours of video games a week. As a planet we're play 3.5 billion hours a week! I enjoyed this chat!
I really enjoyed this chat as well. I'm going to go play cathode ray tube amusement devices for the time being. Enjoy your day!
Haha awesome, bye.
Do you use google a lot?
I do a lot! I think it is second only to the US government in terms of power in a single search.
Yes it is more than it took for Armstrong to get to the moon
Yes. Do you know how they calculate traffic?
Yes that is an average of devices that are on it and an average
Yes. Do you know how they mow the lawn?
Yes they hired goats to eat the grass. Pretty cool.
Yeah that is. Did you ever hear of the time google went down for 5 minutes?
Yes I did, it took down 40% of the web with it
Yeah that is so powerful, speaks volumes, how powerful they are
Yeah, do you think self-driving cars will ever be around?
I think they are cool! Nevada is the frist state to have one, did you know?
Yeah, I wonder why they didn't advance to where they do now.  I wonder if they would have a game there?
Yes that is the grand theft auto one
Yeah. Did you know the first person to have an unlocked iphone was the only person to do that?
Yes that was George Hotz who built his own self driving car out of a garage
Yeah, I saw that.  Mercedes created self driving cars in 2014.
Yes and they went 160 miles per 100 mph successfully
Yeah that project was called the Prometheus project.
Yeah. Do you know people are afraid of the self driving cars?
I wonder why people are so afraid of them. Nice chatting with you!
Are you and you use Google your primary search engine?
I love using Google!  Yahoo searches are accurate and fast, but whay can you tell, Google searches are the best.
Google specializes in internet related services and products.  Did you know that a single search on a computer has more power than the computing power necessary to send a man to the moon.  I wonder how much power it took for a single computer to send man toThe moon?
Wow I guess they do the whole "one thing at a time" thing, do you use google maps a lot? that takes a lot of power
I like Google in general.  They like to go the extra mile.  For instance, google tailors the map to the country's claims and the countries that dispute borders.  Google tailors it to the countries' claims and then tells the countries what each country claims.
I heard about that and think it's a lot of work. I wonder how their servers handle that amount of info and how many self-driving cars google has to do. I know that their servers Handle so much, and they have self- Driving cars Google has to, but I wonder what else they use it for
I did find out that they have self driving cars capable of sensing its environment and responding independently without any human intervention.  That is an interesting concept, I wonder how long it takes the self driving vehicles to find their own way without human intervention, and how they do it.
I know Americans are scared of them, but I stil think they belong in the "don't belong in this group" group. I think they can be very helpful, but if a robot gets confused or if your car gets hacked, then what is the use of it? I st still think that it would stil be useful, but only if the car gets hacks.
I think the current emerging situation is much safer with a single car that can be driven and hooked up to a central system and can be taken off the road.  It's safer than a singleCar on the road that has to be driven by a car that's already driven andhooking up to the central system.
I hope the tech is completely solid enough for self driving cars to get on the streets. There is a risk, but there is also a risk of not having it. George Holtz would not like it.
Human error is the bigger threat to program, even with strict guidelines, there's always going to be a bug, or bug, a bug that causes cascades of failures that leads to other failures that lead to disaster, human error is a bigger threat than the bug itself, I do know who George Holtz, but I don't know much about him.
Yeah, human error is a big threat at this point, the only person I know that has a self driving car is George Holt, and he built a self drive car, Unlock and iPhone, isnt that amazing, his garage isnt it? theres a whole garage built for a self driven car, that is amazing, George Holt
Technology ranges from increased mobility to increased safety to many potential benefits.
It would certainly improve everything. We could have self driving cars that could help with the game grand theft auto and help with game Grand Theft auto.
I did not know that.  Why are video games being used to test that?  Do you know why?
Yeah apparently. I think video games have been being used for that for a while now, but it's super long and weird.
Yes, it was called cathode ray amusement devices, which was used by the military.  It's quite a mouthful if you ask me.
Yeah Cathode Ray Amusements Devices, and yeah cathode ray amusements devices are very long and boring.  I think South Korea is the only ilegar to play video games past midnight.  It is not okay to play Video games past Midnight.
I think they want to encourage kids not to become addicted to games. I think they have too many computers and game and they don't want them to be addicted to the rule.
That is a great rule,  I wonder if it is applied in America lol,  it is a big one but I think it needs to be applied more if it applied in america lol  It is crazy how many hours of video games are played in a week,  add to the numbers that there are more hours of game play in a day than hours ofvideo games are actually played in the week, that is crazy
I wish that we could find a more practical solution to that.  I know that in south korean kids can't get away with studying till late in the evening because of time constraints, but we have to do what we have and find a way to get them to do the right thing!  In any case, it is my pleasure to be able to say that south korea has done the right things and it gives us pleasure and a pleasure in the same case.
Self-driving cars are taking over the focus theses days.  Nevada is the only state to be onboard with a "no self-driving car" state, so autonomous cars are take over transportation.
I would trust them in a self driving car!
Hmmm, good question.  But the benefits are huge!  Increased traffic flow, increased mobility, increased traffic flow (for the elderly, for example), making it easier for them to drive and take children and such.  The strides everyday we are making in self driving cars are very useful and the benefits, good or not, are huge.
It scares the heck out of me that these machines will be trusted so much, but I think we need to give them a try and see how they do. We need to get the joy of driving in our lives again, and not give it up to these machines.
I wonder how Americans feel about that. Mercedez-Benz built a self-driving car called the Prometheus project.
That's good for Mercedes.  Their techology is definitely flawed.  Based on white lanes on the road and sensors, and how cold the sensors can be, I think the vehicle would be based on white lane on theRoad.  I don't think it's crazy that a car could do that, but when it snows, I don's know what to do with my car when it's cold.  It's not like I can drive myself, I'd have to take the road, no matter how far I go.
Self-driving cars improve safety, but it sounds like the systems are still not as advanced.  The self-driving systems use high tech tech and sensors to operate but there are still errors, like no control and no judgement on the decisions, and high errors that can cause serious errors.  Do you think self- Driving cars improve security?
I like that the car can also change the lane after changing lanes.
Self-driving technology is amazing. The GPS is used to guide it. Self-driving Technology is mind-blowing.
I think self driving technology is very dangerous and it is dangerous when using GPS, the worst that could happen is that someone gets lost, or they could die, I don't want to die using the self drivingtechnology, I would like to be in a car with them, what do you think about the GPS?
I feel that robots can cause accidents by making unsafe lane, detecting objects in blind areas, etc. drivers can get into accidents by not detecting these things.
That is a valid point, man, I think we should be able to take some responsibility for our own responsibility for how we drive.  It's a piece of control.  One thing is for sure, if a person is making that mistake for the first time, I feel like the next time a new batch of faulty batch come along I should feel the need to take responsibility and take responsibility for giving them a punishment.  But, I don't like the punishment, because it seems like a punishment, but I am not going to take it seriously.
I understandedly, I don't want to be around people who are not safe and don't share the road with others making it safe for them to safely share it with me. My thoughts as related to cell phones and Alexa and self driving cars, well I think they are ok.
If someone is going to share the road safely with someone else, they should be able to share it safely.  There is a woman who was killed in a Tesla because she did not trust the self driving car.  She was inside the car, and the machine didn't send her out.  That's why they say that people have to re-do their driving license every year because of those factors and they send them out to re -do their Driving License.  A car that can send you inside a machine for that?  I think that should be a thing of the past.
I agree, I wonder what happened there? I think that self driving cars are an advance but I think we need to make them safer. People on bikes, motorcycles, and bikes have been killed more then pedestrians. I wonder if technology continues to advance and if we can make them better, but people will still kill others everyday, if we don't do something to make cars and motorcycles safer and make them more useful, then we will still be killed by cars and self driving car technology continues.
I think we'll get to the point where self driving cars are a safe technology at some point. It will be in our future.  I would love to see a day where selfdriving cars are the way of the future. I hope it's in the next few years.  We need a great freedom of choice and that is great.  It scares me how people will be afraid of it when it starts to become available to them.  People will be more afraid of regular regular cars.  If we are going to have a car man has the freedom to be able to go anywhere and do anything he wants.  That starts with us innocent people.
I think it will remain a choice, I think I would drive a self-driving vehicle will remain the best transportation, but nonetheless, I do think that Uber and Waymo and others are fighting a very uphill battle, and they are winning, but some Americans are uncomfortable, it seems.
I heard that UBER and Waymo are trying to compete.  I wonder what the difference is between the two.  Huge money are involved.
Waymo is the Alphabet-owned autonomous driving car company, but they claim Uber stole their name, so they are a cutthroat, trade-secrets and all.  They claim Uber's stole the name from Waymo, but I don't think Waymo owns the name.  Waymo is a self-driving car company.
Wow, I didn't know that.  I wonder what is current on that happening?
It was, they reached a settlement earlier this year, but the battle still continues, so I think the battle is going on lol. Well it was nice talking to you, emjoy your day, and I'm going to go see if they reached an settlement earlier, now.
Thanks for the interesting chat! Have a good day!
Comics, comics, originated in the 18th century Japan.
Hey there I am, I have in the past, and yeah I am from Japan, so I know that they are a huge industry there, and hey, I am too! Yeah, they did in Japan!
I think it's pretty cool Stan Lee would end every phone call with " Excelsior!"
Haha yeah that is cool. Marvel even published a generic comic book to trademark super-hero and super-villain names that they created.
That was a pretty smart idea to trademark "super-hero" and "super -villain". Marvel get paid more for that one!
Agreed they make a ton of money. DC comics stands for detective comics and they beat anyone at that.
 detective comics comics? lol that seems redundant.
Did you know that the marvel cinematic universe takes place on earth in a multiverse.
Yea Marvel denoted the cinematic universe as a canon.
Interesting. I like Marvel films. I loved Black Panther. Ryan Coogler did a good job directing it.
Yea Black Panther was great, Chadwick Boseman did a great job as T'Challa, he did a really great job.
Agreed. Did you know the symbols and written script are based on the actual scripts called nsibdi?
It is pretty cool Black Panther incorporated nsibdi scrips into their film.
Yeah very cool.  The characters name was briefly changed to black leopard in order to associate it with the party name black panther.  They had to use black le Leopard in order for the name to be associated with the characters.
I knew Marvel black panther party name came from a Marvel black Panther party.
Yeah, I love the movie Deadpool too.  I didn't know that Reynolds read the comic before the movie.  He was destined for the role.  Did you know that Deadpool 2 was going to be about Deadpool, but Reynolds read that and did not take the role?
Ryan Reynolds crossed over from the Deadpool comic and into Shar-pei!
Yeah that explains it. Ryan reynolds is the voice of the mystery villain in Deadpool 2.
Pretty cool. Did you know that the Deadpool video game cost less than the movie?  The movie didn't make as much as the video game did.
I did not know that! Apparently Deadpool 2 is the second installment in the X-men film series.
That's neat!  Well it was nice chatting with you!
Have you ever heard of the Puerto Rico Strong anthology of comics?
No I haven't, I didn't know about that, what was it all this time?
I have not yet but it has a lot of stories about Puerto Ricos history. It has the profits of the United States, United, Puerto Rico, and a lot about the profits.
Sounds interesting, specially since the black panther films were by great writers, specially the best comic book writers of the 90s, they have some great writers.
I have not but I heard good things from some critics. It was made by Marvel and came out last year so it must be well liked by critics.
That's correct, great writers, great history, great intentions, and great writers but I think their intentions are not going to impact the public's perception on Puerto Rico and if you are correct, the public perception on the US as a whole.
It probably should.  There are a lot of economic problems and a lot to do with the hurricane that hit.
Yeah, I hope they're doing better now, I think I saw about that hurricane the other day, they're really struggling and I hope that changes, maybe they're implementing comics, that originated in Japan, interesting how popular it is over there but it's interesting howpopular they're getting after that.
Yeah that is a great move, the cover artist was Naomi Franquez, she did a good job and I think its a great look, the first cover artist
Yeah, I think that the general public hears so much about Jones' act that the point of view is not seen as much as how struggle the island is, economically and especially specially given the history of the Jones act and the struggle the Island has been going through, from my point of point of viewpoint.
I think it's good that the co-creators had worked on Deadpool 2. They are amazing people.
I think the impact is made very big. Deadpool is one of the highest grossing r-rated films all the times, I knew that about Deadpool.
Wow, that really caught people by surprise. I think the lot of diversity in Deadpool is a Puerto Rican Strong project, so that caught people's by surprise too.
Interesting. It's also amazing how many super hero movies try to implement actual cultural artifacts and artifacts from actual super heros instead of just writings like the script for the first script, but find no way to implement them. I find it interesting that the name "Superhero" originated from Nigeria and was originally intended for a movie.
It's always good to learn about cultures. The Msu in Michigan State has the largest available comic collection in the entire world. It is in public and available to the public.
Yep, that would be a lot! I think this project speaks to a lot of the Puerto Rican people, I think that people like Schwartz mentioned, who were offered to answer the call and they did.
Yeah, and the Lion Forge didn't want to take the comic. They just wanted to be the publisher of the comic, and not Puerto Rico.
Yeah, I think it's great to see the Diamond Comics distributors also donating 10 percent of retail sales to United for Puerto Rico, and other organizations like Lion Forge and the Diamond Comic Distributors also donating to help Puerto Rico.
That's interesting, they really do a lot to people.  I like comic books. Did you know DC stands for detective comics?
Yeah, I was thinking that and it crossed my mind what it actually stands for too. I hope it means something with good intentions and all, but in reality at the end of the day it's only for the benefit of everyone. I'm sure it's nice to think it means so much and I hope the people of Puerto Rico get some benefit from it too, but it's interesting that it's something that came about and never really crossed my minds. Speaking of which, speaking of DC, did you know that DC stands for DC DC?
I know, it's intriguing to me too. Thanks for the conversation and the topic.
hey there how are you doing, do you like Puerto Rico? It's the only state to have a state
I'm on the fence, I'm concerned about the devastation the destruction has done. I'm not sure, it has good points and bad points, the hurricane Maria has some good points, but I'm more concerned about all the devastation.
yeah it sounds like it was bad, I guess they started a comic book about Puerto Rico to help raise money, I wonder if it will be a comicBook about Puerto Rican,
Yes, I heard that.  I remember when it was called Puerto Rico Strong!  I wonder how much donations they got.  It had to be more than $1M if it was really called Puerto Rican Strong.
I think Puerto Rico is doing good with the donations.  The donations were even matched by the U.S. United, which matched $1Billion.
Yeah that is great, it is a really big cause and involving a lot of big names as well!  Are you a comic book fan?  I like that the writers are using Puerto Rico as a topic to bring awareness to a Puerto Rican comic book, and bring awareness about the Puerto Rican Comic Book fan
Yeah I agree, Puerto Rico comic books are always good, do you like to read comic books, or watch comic book movies?
I would from time to time, my dad had a collection of them growing up, he would pull them from my collection from time-to-time, but I never did the whole thing.  In my younger years, I did read from time -to- time, but never really changed my way of read from a whole thing, did you ever pull them out?
Yeah that's impressive. and they have been around for a long time.  Stan Lee passed away but I love that he would end his phone conversations with the word "excelsior"  I wonder why he would do that when he used to end his conversations with that word.
That is funny, so many fun facts about him.  I saw that the Msu library has the largest comic book collection, they have it in their library
Yeah, I've heard of that comic book collection, but I don't know if I've ever seen it. I don'l ever see Marvel. I'm not friends with any of my friends that own Marvel.
I like Marvel comics more. Black Panther is actually based on a Marvel comics and not DC.
No I have not seen Black Panther, I was shocked to learn that the richest superhero is actually Iron Man, he is more wealthy than Tony Stark, who is the richest hero, but I am shocked to know that Black Panther is more prosperous and more wealthy that Iron Man.
I didn't realize that.  I didn't even realize that the character Black Panther predated the founding of the Black Panther Party.
I didn't either! That is impressive! It also is impressive that some of the symbols in the movie were based on real written symbols from the 18th century.
That is pretty cool. There are so many movies that they made based on Marvel Comics. Did you know that there are over 300 movies that are made based
There are a few Captain Marvel movies coming out, Iron Man, Captain America, Captain Marvel, I don't personally like any of the new Marvel movies, LOL, what about you?
Yeah, and there are so many more to see. lol. I think my son is really into Deadpool 2.
Deadpool was really good.  I liked knowing that the main character in Black Panther gave up his money for the character in black panther.  Denzel Washington did that knowing that and actually lent him money back in the beginning of his career.
I didn't know that, that's pretty cool.  I like the actresses in Black Panther as well,  they are good actors.  But I have not had time to watch that one.  lol
I thought deadpool 2 was a lot better personally.  That one was worth a watch..
Hello!  Do you like Black Panther?
I have not seen it. Is it good?
I thought it was pretty good, the character is the richest superhero, he is estimated to be about 1.5 billion dollars, the richest Superhero, I wonder how much he really is, it's estimated it's over a billion dollars
That is impressive! I always thought the richest was Tony Stark.
Bruce Wayne is the only one that is close, $80 billion dollars.
That is a lot of money for a superhero these days, I guess. Did you know they will make a sequel to the first movie?  I think they will have to make a sequels to every superhero thesedays, right?
I don't think so. I'm sure it was so popular.
Yes, the character of the movie Captain America- Civil War, Black Panther, was actually based on the character from the movie, Captain America.
No, he was not in that one, but was in Deadpool 2.
No, I haven't seen it. Is it good?
It was. I like superhero movies these days! I like the X-men series, especially the eleventh movie in the X -men series. Have you seen that one?
X-men is the best part. I liked all the movies in the first 10.
I have too.  They are good movies.
Ryan Reynolds in "Deadpool 2" and "Ryan Reynolds: The Last Jedi".
Yeah, he is very funny. It was really good.
He is funny, I liked the movie with Sandra Bullock, I haven't seen that movie. Have you seen that one?
I haven't seen it, have you?
It's a good one.  Did you know that the script for Deadpool 2 was by Betty White?  She and Ryan Reynolds actually worked together on the script.  She was his boss, and he was her boss.  But, he would have to pose as her boyfriend and she would end up falling in love with him.  That's how they ended up falling for each other.
Yeah he did, he was one of the directors, right?
He invested a lot in the movie, so I can see that.
Yeah.  Well, nice talking to you.
Hi, how are you tonight? Do you like Chris Pratt?
I like Chris Pratt a lot. I think he is from the movieGuardians of the Galaxy. I also liked the movie Guardians of the galaxy. How about you? Do you like Chris pratt?
I like him in that show, too.  He used to like waiting tables for the parks and rec.  I saw him in Bubba Gump Shrimp for a few years in the parks.  It's a show about waiting tables.
That's funny! I didn't know that either. It would be nice to have that job some day! I guess James Gunn did a nice job, he directed Guardians of the Galaxy, and I heard he never slept during it. I guess he wanted Chris Pratt to do it since he directed Guardian of the galaxy.
I guess Chris did great, he was the best. I figure those guys need their trainers, they can't bother with anyone else. I guess they didn't bother him because his pack was cgi, I wonder how he would have done.
Nope good for him. Did you watch Always Sunny in Philadelphia? The guy that plays Dennis, the guy who plays Dennis is the lead in Guardians of the Galaxy. Apparently he was in high school when he was running away from his own father and he was like, "I am going to go do it!" haha.
I do!  I hear good things about him!  Glenn Howerton was in AsIP at one point.  I hate Chris Pratt, but like Glenn Howerton, I don't hate him.
Yeah I think that's hilarious! He hates them haha. I think it's cool that Chris Pratt was joking about it though, I think he has a lot of great shows and is a genius, I really liked him in the show that he did jurassic park for back in the day, I'll have to check it out, yeah, he's hilarious, he was genius, and I think its cool thatChris Pratt was the one who did Jurassic Park for back then.
I think Spielberg knew talent, Pratt has a great screen presence, and I understand he had the help of the whole cast.
Yep. I'm glad that Chris Pratt is successful. He sounds like he does a lot of the best movies. I think he was also the best actor in the galaxy in Jurassic Park movies. Did you ever check out Guardians of the Galaxy?
I have not seen the new Jurassic movie, but I hope to see it soon. There are more movies coming out, do you know what movies are the next two movies coming?
I am sure he is, the first two Jurassic Park movies are horrible haha, apparently the dinosaurs in the original one are only about 15 minutes, the Jurassic Park Movies are much better, the second one is only 10 minutes,
The book was also based on a book, but the plot was tight. The technology was right, and the stories were weak. The breakthru was right. The plot wastight. The stories were strong.
Yep I agree. One thing that's cool about that movie, is that the t-rex took 3 hours to render and only took one frame to do so, I wonder if the t -rex in that movie was in that frame?
It was a stunning achievement in computer graphics. I wonder if Spielberg had planned that one. I think raptors were humans, models. I would think that Spielberg had plans to have raptors are humans.
Yep the raptors were actually humans in costumes haha that was great, that is crazy to think that the Jurassic Park ride on the actual movie lol, that would be crazy to see that in the actual Movie lol
I wonder why they had to build such a ride? I bet it was because it was good but not scary enough for the ride. Is it a horror film? Is it really scary?
Do you like horror movies?
I am a big fan of horror movies, especially movies based on Stephen King!  I have seen some movies based upon Stephen King.  You?
Yes, I agree!  Stephen King thought that Bambi was a horror movie.  I agree.  He thought that bambi is a horror.  lol
I remember seeing Bambi at a young age.  I guess it was scary,  but not scary enough that my mom dies.
I never saw Bambi. I think it was sad though lol. I need to watch more horror movies. It helps to burn 180 calories, you can burn more than 180 calories!
Hi, how are you?
Hello, I'm good! How are you? Do you like horror films?
I do. Did you know they exsisted since the 18th century?
It is surprising. Did you know ET was originally supposed to be a horror movie?
I know right, I think I would rather loose 180 calories, I would watch that instead of ET!
I did not know that Inception was actually supposed to be a horror when it came out in 2004!
I've never seen that one. Was it any good?
I saw it a long time ago but I don't remember much about it.
Did you ever watch Jurassic Park? I did and I thought the dinosaurs were just for the first 20 minutes or so, but then I liked them more after that. Did you ever watching Jurassic Park 2?
Yes, I saw the movie, and the primary sound in it is the elephant roar, which is kind of cool, since the trex roar was the primarysound in the first movie.
Hard to believe the fim only cost $15 million to make and the fIM only cost 50 million to come out.
I know! I think the first movie I saw was called Jurrasic Park. Did you know that dinosaurs were in the cretaceous period and there were dinosaurs in the movie from the Jurassic period?
I guesss jurrasic just sounded better.
Yeah I guess, sounds a lot better than "Cretaceous Park" haha,
Chris Pratt sounds like a nice guy, he has been a nice guys before, he helped sick children.
I heard that too, have you seen the movie?
It was actually a new one. He is an actor that is known for his charity work.
Yeah, that is nice of him. Oops I read your sentence wrong. I think I read it right.
Chris Pratt got offered $10M for a CGI of his body and then he went to pack on the body.
He was dating Anna Faris, but they didn't get along, and he had to cook.  He gained 20 pounds while he was dating her.  I wonder if he gained 10 pounds when they were together.
LOL I can see that!  Nice talking with you!
Do you like to watch hockey?
I watch hockey sometimes. I watch the special Olympics. It all started back in 1932. Did you watch theSpecial Olympics?
Wow, that is quite a few years and quite a while.
That is a long time. Apparently they wrote them in the language that is not politically correct today in our newspapers.
Yeah. Imagine if social media had been around before the headquarted. I never knew chicago is where it originated from.
That makes sense. Do you like swimming? I don't watch much of the Olympics, but I like to watch it when it comes to swimming.
I have tried watching but I'm terrible, all I ever do is propulsion through water haha.
Yeah swimming is fun to watch, it's crazy how many athletes in races haha, in fact there is a swimsuit that is banned that is so good it is banned from use by some athletes, it is crazy
I can believe that. The US has more gold medals in swimming than the entire world combined.
The US is one of the best swimmers. I think Michael Phelps has more gold medals than most other countries in history lol, and he is one good swimmers, he is the best.
Wow! Cornell students must pass swimming test to graduate.
Interesting. I live in NY and most people are not required to pass a swimming test in school. The freestyle swim is called the front crawl and is very efficient. I would think that everyone would be required to passing a swimmingtest in school to be able to swim.
I like to think of it as bounding hands and feet and swim like a dolphin.
That sounds really scary lol. Speaking of sports, did you know that the women's Olympic hockey team only lost once to a school boys team in the high school boys' hockey and lost all 6 tries.
Yeah, the womens olympic team did not do very well in the competition, I think.  That is crazy.  The whole dolphin thing is a little crazy.
Yeah I know right, I think its shocking that back in 1924 India beat the United States by three, I don't think hockey is really that good and it's shocking that India beat a whole team haha
Wow. I would quit if I were in a game of hockey and had to lose 8 lbs in one game, I would lose it all.
That is awesome, I need to play tennis more then hockey haha, I play tennis but I am not great at it!
I used to play it badly, I wish I could still play it. They used to use helicopters to dry the field.
That's weird!  I wonder if that was a good idea or not.  The US has a designated tennis racket that can theoretically be used as an object,  a sledgehammer I guess haha but I don't know if thats a good or a good Idea.
Whoa!  I would use that to get to my car door then haha.  It was nice talking to you!
Nice talkin with you,  make sure to watch the longest one shot volley that lasted over a half-hour lol that was the last point in tennis history,  it was a one shot volley that lasted for over a hour,  nice talkin.
Hey how are you? Did you know that Canada's national sports are hockey and lacrosse? I thought it was hockey personally haha.
lol  yes,  I didtnt know that,  that is a good name for a country.  I knew that hockey is the national sport but i didnt know it was a national sport of the country.
Haha I like to play tennis but I don't play it very often. I did know that the longest tennis match was spread over 11 days.
Wow that is a long time to play a match, 3 days I guess both players wanted to give themselves some time to get used to each other and then play, I wonder who won lol, there hasnt been a black champion in a longtime, so there has been a few black champion's but they just never won LOL
The loser would have been sad. I think it would probably work great haha. I like the ingenuity of the helicopter to dry a grass tennis court though, what ingenuity.
ya I agree lol, I wonder how much it would be to dry a tennis court, it seems really expensive, do you know who Gael Monfils is? I think he is really expensive
Nope, I have never heard of him, who is he?
I think he was a tennis player and apparently a natural, he had a lot of talent he was able to learn after a few days Beofre facing Federer and ended up winning the match, he was the only tennis player to do so, he has a lot to learn, he also had the same name as Federer  and ended to winning theMatch
Wow, that's crazy! I think its funny that polo shirts were invented by a tennis player, Federer is one of the polo players, and its funny how he would think that is crazy, polo shirt were invented for a tennisplayer, I wonder why
Yeah, he is a legend, can you imagine getting beat by a rookie like that? the player was Rene Lacoste, he's a legend now, can't imagine being a rookie! I think it's funny that the LacostE brand was the name of the player, his name is Rene lacoste and yeah, that is funny
haha that is cool I didn't know that, also cool that a tennis player actually did wear polos for a time and he actually invented the polo, I wish I could wear one!
It never crossed my mind a tennis player invented it.  I wonder if that is because of the physical effort of the match.  Some of the weight tennis players lose during a match is probably because of how much physical effort they have to put into it. I wonder why hockey is a hockey match, and not tennis.
Good point, I think they sweat a lot too.  I don't play any sports, but I would think that tennis would be tiring and you would need to lose weight if you play, you have to sweat a LOT.  Do you think they lose weight when they play?
I like to swim. I think it's a great sport. It works all the muscles in the body and it works out the body in a way.
I do like to swim. I've heard it really burns a ton of calories and I think it's a great way to work hard. The water is cold but it's warm enough to get the body going. I swam for a long time and I've never swam in the water when the water is cool and warm, but I heard it burns a lot of calories, burns a tons of calories if you work hard and the water has to be cold for a very long time.
Yeah it definitely completes sports. Did you know the US is the leading country in swimming Olympic gold medals.
Nope!  It's weird that hockey rinks and basketball courts can switch spots easily in the sports stadiums.
Yeah, talk about taking advantage of the space for other sports when hockey is out of season.  I think it's good that they have a court lol,  good for them to have that space for two different sports when Hockey is out for the season.
Yes, they need the space. Crazy that Canada is so good at hockey though. It is crazy that Canada scored 132 goals in the first Olympic games and only let in 3 goals in 1924.
I think it is one of their national sports and it has a lot of support towards players and a lotof people interested in playing. I think it has to have a lotOf support towards it to get people interested.
True! I wonder if the team that traded him for him must feel really dumb for trading him haha, he went on to win 4 stanley cups, the team must feel like a really dumb team for trading that guy and he went onto win 3 more stanleys cups after being traded
Did you know the special olympics were born in 1912?
That is awesome that they have been doing that for 50 years!
It is, the 25th anniversary was hosted in Chicago, it was great to promote sports for the disabled people and also great to promoted sports for everyone
yeah, I glad that we are trying to end discrimination in all aspects of our sports and I'm glad that the US is doing something about it.
Yeah it is a great thing, and it demonstrates that the world choses to include us, the Bank of America is one of the sponsors of the event, and they are the first sponsors of an event, so it demonstrates why the worldChosen to include US
yes they have been helping it for many years
I wonder if there will ever be inclusion.  It is sad that only .53% of Americans with disabilities seek employment.  I wonder if it will ever find its way up.
Yes there is.  The bank of America is helping out.  They have a support team for 23,000 individuals with disabilities.
Yeah.  They contribute a lot of disabled people to the print services and also provide work such as warehousing.  A lot of Disabled people are able to use the print and provide work.
I wonder if any of their employees are athletes?  The special olympics?
That is very cool.  I heard Erin Bailey, Tyler Kennedy, and Tyler Kennedy have all won medals for the Special Olympic games.
I wonder if they did it before people with disabilities entered the workforce?
That is a good step. I think more businesses should follow their example and make improvements like the Bank of America has, they made a real difference and more businesses Should follow that, they also made a $1Billion with the Bank, thats a good Step
Do you like to swim?
I understand your question but I don't know much about swimming.
oops, I meant to say you're a slow swimmer. I was going to say there is a banned suit for a slow Swimmer. Oops.
I think the banned swimming suit is an indiscreet suit, right?
Maybe so.  Michael Phelps has golds over countries that have never won at the olympics in any of their races in which he has won.
That makes sense to ban it, I think, but it makes sense they have more gold medals than the rest of the countries combined.
 NBA star Tim Duncan was an olympic swimmer throughout his career, but was scared of sharks during his career.
I had no idea.  Are you a tennis fan?  I don't know much about it.
Good talking to you, have a great day.
Swimming is a good exercise and make muscle relax, it can make muscle Relax!
Swimming is the best! I like to let my kids swim. I know that there are banned swimsuits that can make it go quicker, but they say that the banned swimsuit does not help swimming.
Nice, I like swimming in river more. Do you swim in pools or river more? I like to swim in swimming in pools
I prefer the sea but I don't like jellyfish. I've been stung by a jellyfish before. I do play a few sports like the tennis, but I never got stung.
I do like tennis, do you have a favourite player?
I have seen a bunch of tennis on TV and I don't remember a single players name.  I know that Federer was one of the best ever at Wimbledon, but I'm from England.
I wonder what type of competitive swimming is there?  I know there is one where an athlete has his hands and legs bound and then swims like dolphin.  Is that the one with his hands or his hands/legs bound and he swims?  Or maybe there is a type of swims  like dolphin with both hands and Legs bound?
I can't imagine.  That sounds like drowning to me.  Cornell University makes students pass a basic swim test as a basic class if they are failing a "swimming" test, imagine failing it.
I wonder how many of those they have? In 2008 America scored more gold medals in swimming compared to the rest of the world.
Millions in America, so I know kids swim for all events. I coach for other countries but I don't know if I could coach.
It is a good habit, when I was teenager I was really into swimming, it help us get oxygen to brain it make ourself active and focused, it is good habit.
Yeah, and kids swim for their limbs, so they get exercises for their other limbs.
It make more active brain and good habit are hard to form in the brain, it makes self-discipline and focused on single thing. It help to make self-Discipline andocused on single things.
A player hockey stick would be good on skates, but I would be tempted to use a hockey stick in my hand. It is dangerous with a hockey hand.
I don't really watch hockey because I am afraid. There was an incident where a kid was hit by hockey ball.
The pucks look dangerous flying around and the field hockey with the pucks looks dangerous flying down there as well. I guess it depend on which country is cold. Some countries understand hockey better than others. I wonder how well field hockey is done in some countries.
Canada is the only country in the world to have two national sports.  Lacrosse and ice hockey.
I guess they just have to decide.  Are you aware that the hockey and basketball court on top of the arenas are actually ice?  I wonder if they have to have ice in the hockey or basketball court.
That is interesting. I like ice hockey. It is very interesting. They are playing very aggressive.
I guess they sweat a lot too. I can lose eight pounds in one game.
I wonder why they run so much in a game?
Have a good day!  I have to get the kids going, have a good one!
There is a type of competitive swimming where the athlete swims with their hands and legs bound like a dolphin.
Haha, no I had no idea about that! I saw that on TV recently but I have no idea how to do that haha.
That sounds hilarious to watch! I never realized that the swimming suit plays such a huge role in the swimmer's performance, apparently it was banned in 1964 but they still banned it. I wonder if it was because it was so good or something? It sounds hilarious that the swimsuit plays such an important role in a swimmer performance.
Oh yeah, I think I know the clues. It costs more than $300,000 and is made only for the Olympics.  I wonder how much it costs.
I'm not sure, I wonder if some people win or how they know for sure it is made and what it is used for.
Hmm, interesting. What other sports are you into?
Hockey is interesting. It is the national sport of Canada.
The country with the most national sports is Canada and the best hockey and lacrosse in the world in both hockey and Lacrosse. Who is your favourite hockey team?
Wow, I did not know that.  I thought they were just an Olympic team.  Hockey is my favorite team. It's also my favorite fit sport.  Apparently, players lose up to 8 pounds per game.  Wow, that's how much players lose, I thought it was only the Olympic team, but apparently it's more.
I hear players' favourite meal is chicken parm.  They need to eat all the carbs before games.  I don't know how you get that much in a hockey game, but if you're a player, you need to be able to eat at least some carbs.
I have not but apparently you can go to an ice hockey rink without realizing it. They have ice hockey courts under basketball courts under hockey courts.
The speed with which the ice is covered is pretty cool!  I like watching it.  And the world juniors are starting soon, so the team that gets the best ice is starting to get a team together.
I will, do you enjoy tennis?
I used to when I was younger, but now I don't have time to follow it. I found out recently that polo shirts were actually designed for tennis players. I wonder if people still think of polo as sports, or if they think of it as polo players? I found that out recently too! I didn't know poloshirts were actually Designed for tennis Players.
That's funny! I think a lot of the preppy people wear them now. I wonder why the sports shirts are only for sports shirts. Tennis is so interesting though, especially the games that can run as long as eleven hours! That's a lot! It's funny how much tennis has come along way since those days.
Eleven hours! I can't even watch a game that long. It seems like a drain on me. I think the games would be better if they were only three hours.
Luckily that game was in the 70s, so they stretched it out over 3 days so that the rest of the game was actually 3 days.
True! What is your favourite sport?
I don't really have a favorite sport, but we talked about what Canada's national sports are and one of them is gymnastics or lacrosse, what is your favorite sport?
I like gymnastics, I watch it often in the summer Olympics.  I don't watch too much other than hockey since we talked about sports.  Hockey is my favourite sport.
Merry Christmas!  I'm going to go look up more about it now.
Hello, do you enjoy movies?
I do, but movies tend to not be very strong on special effect and weak on acting. A good sci-fi movie is usually acted in, but not good sci -fi, unless it's strong onspecial effect andWeak on acting
I enjoy how SciFi films incorporate fictional science based depictions of phenomena that still boggles peoples minds.
I agree! Sci-fi is so far-fetched its unbelievable! I like sci-fi based on books because it's realistic but yet futuristic. I think the Hunger Games is a sci- fi based on a novel because it is realistic but still futuristic. The science in there is attainable.
I like films like the space odyssey, but not too much of the new ones.
Space Odyssey is based on a short story titled, "The Sentinel of the Sentinel" that was one of the winners of one of my favorite sci-fi books of the year in 2011.  It got second place in the short story category of my favorites lists.  I like that.  Do you know what the Space Odyssey isbased on?
I tend to watch scifi movies.  SciFi stories are very popular.  Star Wars films and tv are very accurate in terms of space and space opera films.  I think there are a few scifi stories in there that are popular. The writers have done well.  Did you know NASA has a list of "to star wars" novels and films that is accurate to the films?
That's good that Nasa emphasizes real definitions for actual terms instead of imaginary concepts.  I think it's good too that actors use the Star Trek transporter.  It's a good that NASA emphasizes real Definitions for actual Terms instead of just using imaginary concepts, like Star Trek's transporter.
I think that explains why fan conventions are tremendously lucrative for actors, making $300-$400 per weekend and that explains how much they make!
I wonder if they have a definition of "late 80s" by definition.  I wonder if that would work for Elon Musk's Hyperloop tunnel in Socal.  Have you heard about it?  I think it's on NASA's list of "To be Seen."
I have not heard much about the hyperloop tunnel, but I have been hearing about it.  Elon Muzk has founded many innovative companies, but his aerospace company SpaceX is the most well known.  I think he is the only one who has this type of plan.  His company SpaceX, is the company he has founded, along with the aerospace company that he founded, SpaceX.
SpaceX is the leader in private space transportation and exploration.  It's very expensive.  I think it's very interesting that they are using Monty Python for the cheese.  That highlights Elon's weird sense of humor.
I guess he has an interest in improv and acting. I saw he produced and acted in a movie about smoking and he is known for his interest in Improvisation and acting
The acting bug bit his wife too.  Inception, he made an appearance in that movie, but he never made an Appearance in anything else.  He's interested in trying to join Elon's first transport to colonize Mars, and then he will join Elon in trying  to colonIZE Mars.
I don't think I would go to Mars, but if it's proven to work I would.
Yes, knowing that success only occurs when it is a hard fought struggle.  True explorers are the ones who go there knowing that.  LOL  I would be a traveler that would like to go to the sun for survival tips and see if it occurs.  I am a rock from the sun, I will be the first to go.  Maybe I will take some survival tips from the true explorers and use them.
That could teach Elon Musk something.  He desires to build a vertical take off electric passenger jet that is supersonic.
I think he has a vivid imagination and deep enough pockets to dream that big!  He's also been known to have a vivid imaginations and deep Enough pockets to think that his antics are humorous.  He was also in a British comedy sci fi series, The Red Dwarf and the British comedy Sci Fi series, Red Dwarf 2.
I enjoy the Red Dwarf, I enjoy comedy in general, because it encourages laughter and focuses on humor.
Agreed.  I'm weak in sci-fi, but I'm glancing through the reviews for the new releases and read some write-ups about the Sophia of Silicon Valley.  It has me thinking about adding it to my reading list.  Do you have an e-reader?  I've got one, but it's only an ereader.  So far, no reviews or new releases.  You're not weak in Sci-Fi, though.
I recently heard of it.  It offers a surprising insider's take on how the Roman Clef of last time he tried succeeding, in this case by using a Roman clef.  I will be reading this book, as well, if it is not the first.  In the case, it offers a surprised insider's view of how he is succeeding.  Thanks for chatting today!
The author has rubbed shoulders with Steve Jons and Elon Musk, and is accustom to pushing the boundaries of what people are willing to do.  Good for him for those insights.  It is good to see people like him pushing the envelope and pushing the boundary and being willing to try new things.
The reason I want to check out the book is for that reason alone
Have you watched Deadpool 2?
Yeah I have and I really enjoyed it. It is lots of fun, especially the breaks in the fourth wall, and breaking out of the fourth break in theFourthWall, it is the top of the 4th wall, I think I enjoyed it the best!
It is the highest grossing R-rated film of all time.I have not watched the second one yet. Is it as scary.
Hmm....I'm not sure if it is or not.. I have sworn passion, sworn passion is the highest grossing R rated film... and then "Christ in a Can" is the second highest grossed R ratedFilm, that is weird..  and I think it is a little weird.. hmm...
It was an R-rated film.  I think it was.
It was, it is graphically violent, and argued gratuitously with passion. It was controversial and could be argued gratuitsously. Speaking of Deadpool, the video game cost more than the movie did to make! Crazy, but it was also controversial and was also graphicallyviolent, and crazily, the movie was actually more violent than the video.
That is crazy!  That is crazy,  how can that be?
Yeah, it's a lot of money. The development of video games these days are actually bigger businesses than movies are and they have a lot more money to do the development ofvideo games these now.
True, but video games have come to life in more ways than one.  I mean even toys based upon movies, and toys based on TV are better than the toys based Upon movies.
Speaking of superheros.. Garfield was a superhero for awhile.
I did not know that. Did you watch Garfield?
I used to read the books when I was younger, they have a book series spinoff called Pet Force, where he and his friends as superheros and there is a book Series spinoff  spinoff call Pet Force 2.
I've never read that one.
Speaking of superheros, Stan Lee was a rip off of that. he wrote so many comics and I never knew that. i wish i had written about him.
Stan Lee?  I didn't know that either!
He is the guy who created the x-men and was one of the original writers of marvel comics.  Spiderman is another one of his characters. He has a cameo in all of the marvel movies, and Spiderman was one the original writer of the fantastic four.
Wow, I didn't know that.
Yeah, it was a big star in the comic book and superhero world.  Speaking of stars, did you know that the sun is so cold that it is cold enough to touch with the human hand if you touch it in a comic book?  Weird!
I think I read that somewhere, but I'm not sure if it's the same star or a different star. It's definitely different than the Earth.
I dunno.  I have my doubts, I think it is a bunch of a bunch,  a lot smaller than it used to be.  But I had heard that it got hit by a large asteroid which upped it mass and I think that is why.  Ddunno,  but it was probably a lot bigger than the large asteroid that got hit.
Have a great afternoon!  It was nice chatting with you!
Good morning!  Did you see Deadpool 2?
Yes, I have seen it. I think I have to watch it before watching the MCU in order to see if it is better than the Deadpool video game, which ironically, ironically, is the best of the movies. Meaning it must have been very expensive to make, meaning it must not have made as much as the Deadpool Video Game because it was only $15.
Ryan Reynolds crossed over from "Deadpool" to sharpee, I like that.
That lead to Reynolds thinking he was drawn to the role. He literally did that, literally!
Agreed lol. I wonder if Ryan Reynolds will be the voice of the mystery villain, or just a mystery villain?
Have you ever read any of the Garfield pet force comics?
I have not, are they good?
I think they are cute. All of his friends are superheroes, just like Garfield.
Cool. I read about a comic series about fixing collateral damage created by superheroes.
Have you heard of normalman?
I have not heard of Normalman.
He is a person who is the only person on the planet without super powers and he wants to help the planet.
That is cool, I wonder what super powers he has.
He has many! I don't know, do you?
Ahh...he must be lonely then LOL, what powers do you have?
I doubt it, hes friends with all the superheroes registered, plenty of company, there are over 300 superheroes registered in the US.
Wow that is a lot, that is quite a lot!  I wonder if that means there are so many in the universe?
I know there is a theory that the universe is a giant hologram and there is another theory that it is just one giant holograms
Yes, I heard there is a theory there is only one electron in the universe and that is the only theory that there is one electron.
I guess so, but stars are still cold enough to be touched, I wonder how many stars are out there that can be touched!
It's been good chatting but I need to go, take care.
hey have you ever seen the movie Deadpool 2?
I did! I loved both Deadpool movies. I think the first one was hilarious, and this one is like a cross between Ryan Reynolds and a sharpei.
Haha! I'm glad he did well in that role. I'm also happy that he was rated R because I was so happy with how he did in that.
I loved it, the surprising part is that there was nothing inappropriate in the movie, there is nothing in the movies that I would consider inappropriate for me
lol yup I agree I agree with you, I also really liked the first Avengers movies as well
I think the James Cameron and David fincher read the script and champion the project so they were able to have James Cameron read the novel for the script for the movie.  I think it is so good that he was able to read the Script and champion The Last movie.
ya theyre both great directors, theyre great directors. btw, did you see the end of Deadpool 2? there's a mystery villain voice in it, I wonder who it is?
I think it was Ryan Reynolds right?
haha yes I did see him play the deadpool game btw, he is so good and cost less to make than teh first movie, which was really good and Cost more than $200k to make!
I played it, and yes I did! I should check it out again! That's shocking considering Deadpool is the highest grossing r rated movie ever! It was directed by George Lucas or James Cameron, which is shocking considering it's the highestgrossing R rated movie!
Haha, yes that is shocking! I have not seen it yet either. Apparently there are over 300 superheroes in the USA. That's a lot to choose from, I wonder how many of them are registered in the usa, there are a lot of superheroes.
I loved the first Batman movies and am a huge fan of the Batman movies.  Did you know there was a spinoff of a Garfield named Pet Force which featured a new superhero?
Haha, that sounds cool! Stan Lee actually made some comics. I'm shocked he alwayd did stuff with DC and not Marvel. I know Marvel does, but I'm still shocked he's alwayD did stuff like that.
That is really cool. I was saddened to hear that Stan Lee passed away a few weeks ago. He was a pioneer and I was really saddened to hearing that Stan lee passed away.
I agree I miss him too. I read the comic about the collateral damage caused by superheroes that sounds interesting, have you read the book?
That does sound interesting, I'd be interested to learn about Normalman, he's the only person on a planet of superheros without power, I think.
lol, I've read that the universe is a big hologram and we live on a big Holoram.
I'm not sure.  I'm not deep enough to contemplate that.  But it's mind boggling stuff.  Did you know that only one electron exists in the universe and that no other electron exists?  That is deep.
I agree, and I wonder how that works?  Like there is a star that is cold enough to touch and we cannot touch it, it's a star and it is cold and we can't even touch it!
I know scientists say that universes are subject to natural selection anddarwinism which puts their own spin on things like that.  Like Earth, but with the universes being different than Earth.  I wonder if that puts a different spin on natural selection?
Wow!  We are apparently a part of outer space, currenty galaxy, we are pulling out of our galaxy, and pulling on another one.  I want to explore outerspace, I want the outers space that is outside our galaxy.
Hello, what do you think about the universe?
I think the whole Universe is so fascinating.
I do love learning about science. I think the universe is very interesting. There are many theories about the universe. I love learning to hear about them. Very interesting to hear.
I agree, I've heard there is a theory about the universe and natural selection, I don't like that theory but I'm not sure what you mean.
I guess it makes sense, but I don't think it's very robust.  I mean there are so many laws and constants in the universes and all, I guess it's makes sense that it wouldn't be too robust.
I think universes evolve through natural selection like we do on earth.  Crazy to think about how different species come from one another.  I never thought about it that way.
I hope to see it in the next billion years, who know what the universe is doing.
I hope so too! I've heard that the universe is one giant superhologram!
Yes, maybe tiny holograms! Thanks for chatting.
I hope not, but that would be freaky!
I wonder if God dreams about that?  Or if it is part of his illusions, like a holo-dream or a part of the illusions.
That's crazy!  Have you heard about cold stars?
I have not. I thought stars were hot, but I did not know cold stars were cold.
Apparently there are stars in the universe that are cold enough to be touched by the human hand, I wonder how they know that, and also why they are cold, stars are not even able to be touch by the Human Hand
That is very interesting. I guess that is why we have the moon, the moon and even mars.
I would love to touch a star, I wonder if it is still there. I would love  to touch one.
Star's are fascinating. I think most people don't know the sun is star.
I feel like we learn about it only in middle school.
I know right!  I wonder how people sleep through that school... Anyway, great chat!!
haha true, I bet Sir Isaac Newton didn't sleep in school at all!
He was a genius. Have a good day!
You too! Thanks! :)
Hi, how are you?
Hello, do you like reading?  I have a wired life and like to keep up with the news and reading.
 tech is becoming part of so much peoples daily lives now, and we are not even aware of it
I think it is amazing that Sifi, mobile phones and genetic modification are things that are now the norm and we are accustomed to them.
I wonder if the phone will ever go down.
I've tried reading the oracle year by Charles Soule, Daredevil and Death of Wolverine, books.  I tried the Kindle app, it never worked for me, but it worked for the kindle.  Have you heard of the Kindle?
I heard those titles, but not who he is.
Sci-Fi is the mainstream in many ways because it depicts phenomena that are not fully accepted by the mainstream, but I love it because of its scientific plausibility and plot logic.
Do you like sci fi films?  If so, what movies or series do you like?  I like sci Fi movies, but not the tv ones.
Space Odyssey is my fav.
I like some sci fi movies. Star wars is a decent one.
It is a good collection of authors and a lot of books that changed my life. I really like Bethanne Patrick and her books.
I heard of it I will have to check it out, I have not heard of her before.
I hope it doesn't feed into the feed!
I have not seen it yet.  Is it a series on amazon?
I will def watch it, I have seen the first one.
It premiers this year!  Do you know when?
Yes, it is. I can't imagine it in my head.
I know, right? What do you mean?
Yes, the books, movies and tv shows are all better than the books!
I like the Lost series.
I liked it a bit too. I think it was a beautiful show, both in writing and visually. Sci-Fi, right?
I thought it was too.
Well I got to go back to work now, nice chatting, I will see you later.
You too! Thanks!  You too!
Do you like the sci-fi stuff you check out?
Are you a Star Wars fan?
I am, I like the young Han Solo movie the best
I've seen the first three, I watched on Netflix recently.  Have you seen it?
Nice, well I did like it, I was just reading a review of the first one.
It is worth checking out. The first three Star Wars films have brought in the combined box office revenues of over 8 billion dollars.
That is a lot of money. Lucas and 20th Century Fox agreed to forgo a $500,000 directing fee for each of the first 3, and 20 century Fox agreed for licensing and merchandise rights for the next 3.
I feel like I know how Lucas pulled that off, but I didn't know that. The entire franchise is estimated to be over $65 billion dollars, so I don't know how he got away with that.
I think it cost them billions and made Lucas a $65 Billion billionaire
Cha-ching! He won an academy award for editing the first movie, but his wife Marcia, who did the editing, did not.
I wonder if George got a win for directing?
I know right! James Earl Jones only spent 2.5 hours recording all the lines for darth vader's voice, and then he only had to do 4 hours recording for the movie!
yup that is too bad he only got paid $7500 for just 2.5 hours worth of work, but he got paid
Not too shabby!  lol I wonder if he was able to tie fighter pilot prior to piloting the millennium falcon?  Han solo was a fighter pilot before he was han solo, he did tie fighter Pilot prior to Piloting the Millennium Falcon.
Really? I didn't know that! I know that his friendship with Chewbacca was with an imperial lieutenant.
I did not know that. I think that is why I did not like the movie, lol. I do not want to spoil it for you.
lol  I haven't seen it either.
lol  Christopher Walken was considered by George Lucas for the part of Han Solo in the original movie, but he didn't want to take the role.  He didn't think he was right for the role, so he didn's take the part!
Pacino turned it down because he did not understand the script.
I didn't know that.  Would you share with me any facts about planets?
I do!  Did you know Jupiter's moon ganymede orbited the sun and would be considered a planet if it orbited it?
Interesting, I had a good time chatting, thanks!
Same here!  Thanks.
Good evening!  Have you seen the Solo Star Wars movie?  I thought it was great.  Have a good evening!
I thought it was great! I thought it had creative differences with the original directors but I'm curious why one was fired and the other got fired. I think the product was better than the original.
Yeah, I love Star Wars in general. I loved it when it first released in 1977. I love star wars in general
Yeah I think it was a huge part of my childhood growing up, it was the first one and then the second and third and fourth ones.  Now the franchise is worth over $65 billion.
Apparently George Lucas' wife had some input on some of the films.
Yeah, I heard that she actually won an award for editing and idea inputs on the film. She even stated that she saved the best movie from the prequels and brought it to the first film, which was stated by the movie, but she saved it for the second film.
Wow yeah she deserves it.  Star wars is so popular in so many cultures.  The first major film dubbed in Native American was in 1977 and was the last major film to be dubbed in native American!
I gotta admit Lucas business smarts. He forgoed a $75k fee on Star Wars and kept the merchandising rights for himself. Now he is a billionaire. Gotta admit Lucas's business smarting!
Wow interesting, yeah a major powerhouse, he missed out on a lot.  James Earl Jones was going to be voicing Vader and they would have paid him $500k,  but instead he got $75k and now he is voicing Vader for $65k, yeah that was well done.
I can't imagine Bill Murray doing that! Speaking of Star Wars, can you imagine BillMurray trying out for the role of Solo when he auditioned for the same role of solo?
Haha, I'm glad he did. Pacino also auditioned and turned down the role.
Dunno if that is true or not lol, but it is kind of funny. I heard somewhere Nick Nolte also auditioned and didn't get the role. I wonder what scene in the film he didn't do well? esp when he's exasperated at a scene lol. That would have been kind of fun to see, I wonder how true that was, I heard something about Nick NOLte also being exasperated with a scene in it LOL
Haha hilarious so true! I wonder if he was considered for it? I think I'll add Christopher Walken to the list now though so I can add him to the lists as well.
I read in an early draft that Han Solo was supposed to married up with a Wookie.  Who the heck would have known?
Haha, it would have made things interesting. The planetary system is interesting though. Venus has no seasons, which means it is not a Star Wars world. I wonder what the Seasons are on that planetary system.
Yeah, it is interesting! I like it too.  Space is big, but it can be interesting.  Did you know that Douglas Adams said "If you git a planet between earth and the moon, there's a moon?"  That's the moon.  I wonder what that's all about?
Whoa very smart words!  Did you know that Jupiter's moon would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun?  It would be Jupiter's moons would be our moon if it was considered a Planet!
Speaking of Jupiter though, it would be impossible to have manned space stations on the orbit of the planet because of the radiation the planet emits.
That is interesting.  It sounds very cancerous!  Did you know that Uranus is the only planet that rolls around the sun?
Speaking of rotating, there is a planet that orbits 3 stars and the only planet that orbits 3 stars. I gotta google that sometime.
Wow I'll def have to look that up as well, and also the planet that precipitates shards of glass, there is a planet that's precipitates Shards of glass!  Well it was lovely talking with you, I hope you have a great evening, stay away from that planet, goodnight.
That young han solo movie was really great!
I have, thought it was ok I agree with you.  I read that he is a robot in the first part, but I don't agree with that part
Nah, I don't like Alden playing Han solo. He was too young and handome, too young. I like Aldin playing Han Solo.
I thought the cinematography was excellent. He did a good job. I understand that it got a bad review, but I thought the Cameramen did a reallygood job.
I loved chewbacca, such a great character.
Yeah, I like that movie.  I know that many people expected it to be a total Star Wars duplicate, but how does George Lucas feel about that?  Did he think people expected a "Total Star Wars Dupl duplicate"?
No doubt!  I liked the story and the cinemagraphy of it.  It was good to see Bradford Young doing cinemagraphs, but not the best.
Yep, I think it will be.  I was surprised to learn that James Cameron was a truck driver before he decided to become in the film industry.  Did you know he was a writer before Star Wars?  I think I know what you mean.  But, yep, I was really surprised to learned that James cameron was a salesman before he became a truckdriver.
That is pretty crazy.  It's amazing that all of the movies from the series were nominated for Academy Awards, even a bunch of sequals.  I think all 5 movies of that series were nominees for Academy awards.
Yes it is.   The Star Wars saga is told by George Lucas, the Return of the Jedi.  It took over 40 years for the last Jedi to return to the Jedi Temple.
I had heard that. That was a great idea. The series has been so successful that it holds the Guinness World Record for the most successful film and merchandising franchise. There's a ton of merchandise franchise rights sold for a ton.
It's funny how some things do go over well.  Like the Family Guy versions that were produced for Star Wars.  I've not seen the Family guy versions, have you?
No but it's funny. I did see Han Solo, he's pretty unique. Pacino is also funny. He turned the role of R2D2 into a Han Solo and that was pretty unique too.
Bill Murray auditioned for the part. Ford said he didn't want him.
I did not know that George Lucas had made Han Solo a large green alien.
I don't think I like the original star wars I guess. He was secretly married and had a Wookie as his wookie.
I think he was secretly married to a Wookie! That must have made chewbacca jealous.
I hope he was angry at that! I would hate to be toy Han solo. He loved firefly. He was supposed to do an episode of that. Totally missed that one. He would be angry at me because he would have loved that episode. I loved fireflies too.
I have never noticed a toy of him in the solar system, so that means a lot of others, have you noticed a Toy of any others in the Solar System?
ya apparently there is also a planet that orbits around 4 stars, weird orbit, and also a planets that is in a weird orbit
It must be a weird orbit, it tilts so much and has no seasons, but it also tilts and has seasons
Hello do you like Star Wars?
I do! How about you?
I like Star Wars too!  Did you know that Solo was the first Star Wars story to be a solo?
I haven't seen it yet but I heard it is a fan of the franchise, I heard that it failed to gross over $270,000,000 but I didn't know it failed.
Yeah,and that is just the size of the normal audience during opening weekend.
I've heard mix reviews are not an accurate indicator of the quantity of people that will watch a movie on its opening weekend but I think it's a more accurate indicator for the quantity that people actually want to watch.
Well, it was a bad omen for the Star Wars franchise that it might be a bad thing, but people are all about consumer moviegoing behavior.  I think the rest of Hollywood is trying to keep up with consumer movie Going behavior.
That is true, but I think the low turnout for a major release like this is usually because the worth of mouth and interest is lacking.  I think this was a low turnout because of low worth of name worth ofmouth and interest, not because of the low attendance.
That's a lot. I saw it last weekend, it was a big drop off, but I don't know if it's a bigdrop off or not.
It seems like a problem for all major releases, and very troubling for them.
I think the box office has been very accurate in predicting the "spring and summer period" ratio at the boxoffice.
It's also an emerging trend to have films released in movie theaters before the films actually are released in movies.  That keeps people interested in the films immediately after they are released.
I don't know.  I think that is Netflix to blame.  No one is interested in going to see movies anymore.
I think it is. Personally, I still watch movies in theaters, but I don't enjoy them as much. I feel like they should have released them the way they were released. Do you watch movies on there?
I think the success of Black Panther and avengers: Infinity War will help.
I like Star Wars, but also marvel.
I wonder if that's why it made that box office year. By August things had cratered 30 percent since it had made so much in the previous one but in 2016, it had done a similar ternd, I believe it made about $1.65B and made that Box Office year.
I wonder how recent releases will affect the Star Wars franchise. The franchise is worth $65 billion.
I thought it was higher since it was the highest grossing media franchise, I would have thought it would be higher on that list.
It is.  George Lucas was a billionaire for the original Star Wars.  He got to keep all the merchandising rights for the merch and such.
I didn't know that. His wife got an academy award for editing the film. I don't know the details of the original Star Wars film, but her name was on the academy award.
Hello, do you like to watch movies?
Yes I do, I prefer to watch tv series though, you?
I like TV. Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty was a failure.
It was a failure, it was the most expensive box office flop ever. I loved it as a kid. Disney had some bad choices to make and they did make some good choices during that time, like treasure planet, I loved that one. Disney's "Treasure Planet" was the second most expensive Box Office flop and the first one to be a failure.
Ouch, that sucks, I haven't watched it either, I like Disney movies. I wonder if it was because it was one of the first Disney movies to come out,
Haha I liked the animated ones.  That was an animated box office failure.  I guess Tom Hanks is the highest earning box office star of all time and also the highest ever box officestar for the animated movies.
He is a great actor! he is really good, but the movie he is in sucked lol, the movie was actually really good
It is difficult to predict what is going to flop. 20th century fox, convinced that star wars would be a flop, would forgo a $500,000 fee for directing. George Lucas, who would be in the billions, would instead forgo that fee for merchandising and licensing rights to Star Wars.
I know right,  that is why it made it to the box office hahaha  that doesnt say that it is a valentines day movie,  but I just heard silence of the lambs was a val Valentines day film and made like $270 mil and its coming out on a valentinines day,  I heard silence for the lambles was a box office success at the box Office   $309 mil at the Box Office hahahaha
Haha, I don't mind watching a superhero movie like avengers: Infinity War. That is the first film to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras.
That is a great movie! I have to watch it now, it is coming out soon! I am trying to catch up lol, it will be a great film,  I will watch it when it is up.
Yeah, it sounds like it. The first movie came out on Valentine's Day. Avengers caused an increase in shawarma sales. I don't eat Shawarma, so it sounds a little fun Valentine's Day is when you eat shaw Sharma.
HAHAHA Tony Stark didn't eat shawarma at the end of the last one. It was a huge battle, but they didn't show him eating it. The avenger movies don't really show him Eating Shawarma.
Interesting.  I remember watching the original Hulk on the tv series and the actor who played the Hulk has been voicing the characters for decades.
Yeah he does, I havent seen him in any other work though.
Speaking of voice work, the voice actor who played Jarvis, the Iron Man series, did voice work for the films.
Yeah thats pretty funny. He must be a good voice then.
I like him in avengers, he did the voice of Gretchen in recess, the waitress that Captain America saves from the Avengers. He is the voice.
I dont know the actress, but I dont think she is any good, I have never seen the show recess.
She is interesting. There is a lot of overlap in voice work and acting, I think there is a whole lot of overlaps in voicework.
I think you're right!  Its been fun talking with you!  Have a good one!  Bye!
Are you aware that Solo is the first Star Wars story that did really well at the box office?
No I didn't.  I wonder why that movie barely made anything?  I'm sure there were millions out there.
Those numbers are horrible.  It made $270K in its first weekend, but then it got a 50 percent plummet over the next weekend.  I wonder if a film of that caliber would have made that many, or if it would have taken a 40 percent plummet.
For sure, it is. Do you like the Star Wars franchise?
I think they've saturated the market with too many people going to the movie every year.  I like Han Solo portrayed by a different guy for each movie.  Harrison Ford was the best, but there are better people out there.
I think it is the opposite, he is perfect for the role.
Apparently a slip up in the last few weeks is not bad.  Only 7 percent of all blockbusters in the week is considered good, but only 7 percent in the first 10 weeks are good
I wonder how much Hollywood has to do with the box office, or at least the ticket office.
Yes, I was aware of that.  I think I enjoyed that movie.  Box Office is a quiet place.  It is a very business.  Did you know that the sleeper hit of the year of 2014 was a good one at the box office?  It was a quiet time for business, but it was a sleeper hit.
That's good.  I didn't know that John Carter was that good. It's fascinating that the movie was a flop in the UK and broke box office in the US.  Disney is a flops in other countries as well, like Russia.  Did you know that in 2014, John Carter, Disney's "fascinating" movie, broke boxoffice records in Russia.
I'm surprised by how well a movie does internationally. I think most movies that bomb here made their money back overseas. I like action movies.
That is true, I think it has been awhile since I've seen a movie that did well in the US but I was talking about back in 2015.  Star wars has been going for so long and fans are crazy about it.  I was really impressed with it, but I haven't seen it in awhile.
I am not either.  I like nostalgia, but I tend to be more of a fan community.  As a child, I used to watch them repeatedly but now, I tend not to.  It is blasphemy for me to watch it repeatedly.
hahahaha, I am thinking the same way.  Fox News was desappointed by the flop of the first one and accpeted George's proposition to forgo an additional $10,000 directing fee for the second one.  I wonder if that was because he was des disappointed that the first movie was a flop?  Hahahaha
I wonder if it was because of the money or if it's just kind of a bad choice on his part.  I don't know, he was probably made aware of the value of money, but it's always positive when a star is willing to do something like that.  On another subject, did you know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office earnings star with over $8.5 billion in worldwide worldwide box office revenues?  That's a positive thing for him, even if it is kind of bad.
No, I did not know that. I didn´t know that he made so many billions of dollars, I think it is incredible how actors and actress can make so much money. I mean look at Star Wars, he made over $700k per movie. I wonder how much he made for Star Wars? I didn't even know that was a movie.
It sure is a lucrative industry, James Earl Jones only made $75,000 voicing Darth Vader's lines for Star Wars, I wonder how much money he got for that, I know that James Earl jones only made about $7,500 voicing Darthader's lines in Star Wars
That is incredible! I wish I could be a teacher. You dont get paid for not studying harder so you should study harder. But James still made some money. He is an amazing actor. He played iron man in the iron man series and avengers films. I wonder if James still makes that much money from those films.
That is shocking, I think most people would have a hard time watching it for that reason, I hope he has a hard reason, but still, I can't believe he's not seen them all.
Hahahaha.. I know right!  Robert Downey Jr. is such a hilarious actor,  I wonder if it's hard for him to hide food from the other actor on the sets?
Wow!  Seems unnecessary with craft services.
Hello.  Do you like the Star Wars series?
Good afternoon!  Yes,  I do.  I like Star Wars!  Do you?
Yes, I like the films. I'm amazed that Al Pacino turned down the role of Han Solo. I didn't understand the script for the films and was amazed that he was given the role.
I am glad he turned it down, I think it's a great al Pacino. He was great in the first picture, but I do like Han Solo and I am glad that he got to be Han Solo.
I figure Sam Jackson would have done better. George Lucas originally intended Solo to be a large green alien, but he didn't want to be around a black man.
I have heard that Christopher Walken was going to be put in as Han, but George Lucas as Han.  I think that was to put an extra extra special special spin on the picture and was considered to be better than the original one that they did.  Did you know that Star Wars has been around since 1977? I heard that George Lucas did this.
Walken would have been a bit too dark. Han solo would have done a little better. Han was the imperial lieutenant, but his companionship with Chewbacca as an imperial lieutenant would have kept it a bit different.
I find it hard to believe that 21st Century Fox thought Star Wars would flop.  I can't believe that.  Fox thought star wars would flops in 1977.
Yes, I understand the story behind it. Lucas was going for a sci fi film before Star Wars. He thought a sciFi film would be a tremendous film. It did so badly though because he could not understand the movie.
Maybe that was the part that made him a billionaire, big mistake on their part, he is now a billionaire
I wonder if Lucas knew how much licensing and merchandising he would get from that?    I mean, toys and t-shirts would sell for sure.
I think that is good.  Did you ever have the original Star Wars lunchbox and thermos? I still own a part of the original one.  They are in pretty rough shape.
I think nostalgia is better than memories!  James Earl Jones was only paid $7500 for his voice in darth vader and only spent 2.5 hours recording all of his lines, and was paid $32,000.  I wonder how much he made on residuals.  James earl jones was the first star wars actor to be paid, and spent only 2.25 hours recording his lines.
That's a low amount, but I hope he got it, Darth Vader's voice is such an icon of the franchise, so that's a really low amount.
Did you know that star wars was dubbed in navajo, the first major film to be dubbed in a Native American language, making it the first film to do so. jej says the first Star Wars was dubbed by Jej
Idk,  I don't know who James Earl Jones is.  Who knows.
He has a distinct voice that he learned to pronounce Navajo.
It's kind of funny that when Marcia won an academy award for star wars, George was so mad because his wife, Marcia won an Academy award for Star Wars that he didn't, I wonder if his wife was more mad than he was
I guess that was a source of tension for a few years!  I guess they both want recognition from the Academy and they make more than billions, but they want recognition for all of those years.
I know, I would be crying in the bank, and I share in his bank.
I guess so! Anyway, great chat!
Great chatting with you as well!  Have a good day!
Hello! How are you today?
I am good. Do you like to read?
I do. I just read Macbeth. Have you read it?
I have not, but heard about it. Nesbo just wrote a version of Mcbeth set in the 1960s in Northern England.
Northern England, where a witches and a drug lord named Hecate, defies both Police Chief Duncan and Inspector Macbeth in a novel about witches in which she defiesboth police and the drug lord.
What do you know about Shakespeare?
Quite a bit actually.  He is called England's national poet and also the bard of avon.
He was also a great dramatist that influenced a lot of people. Joe Nesbo was another great dram atist that influences a lot.
I know!  Did you know that Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.  Kinda amazing considering the year is only a little over a year,  kinda amazing.
It is.  Miranda is the name of the two little girls invented by him, Jessica and Olivia.  She was good at giving names.
That is a cool fact. Do you know much about the sun?
I do like the sun, but I like the winter when it doesn't heat up so much, what about you?
I love sunflowers and summer!
Yes, me too. Did you know a lightening bolt is hotter than the sun? That's surprising to me.
And the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy, which is the sun.  It is 1 billionths the size
The sun is not that big! But the discovery of the universe is always big. Neptune just completed its first orbit around the sun in a year and it's only the second orbit in our solar system.
Cool!  I read that.  I did not know that!  The diameter of the sun is 109 million kilometers (about 50 times that of Earth the sun) and the mass is about 330,000 million kilometers!
I think that it's massive because of the energy created by the reaction on the surface.  It's a massive reaction from all the energy we have on the sun.
Wow!  Nice talking to you!
Same here. Do you know who Mark Twain and MJ are? Jane Austen?
I have not read her, but lets talk about something I have read, why did he think that ?
Nintendo has been around for over 30 years and was a playing card company for more than 40 years
I did not know that.  I love nintendo!
The toy company that owns it, also produced a lego knock- off in 1985.
Cool, they have a long history, I like the system, do you like it?
Nintendo used to have an app for the Seattle Mariners and you could order food through it.
Wow, that's awesome! They lose so much money and only run up to 15 million bucks every year, but I'm sure they can run up more if they need to!
Wow! I didn't know that. I don't really follow tennis. I do know that they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open.
Cool, I love tennis.  I did not know that.  It is strange that a racket is the most item used by a tennis player and not the other way around.
That is strange.  The longest tennis match went on for 11 hours and took 3 days!
Whoa! That is so much endurance! Soccer makes more money than tennis, football, basketball, and golf combined. That is just too much.
Polo shirts were invented by Rene "the crocodile" Lacoste and were adopted by polo players after they were invented.  Polo shirts were used by poli players until the 1940's.
hahaa that is interesting. Did you know grunting after a shot in tennis is considered cheating?
That sounds strange but it is distracting I guess. I also didn't know that the universe could be one giant superhologram.
That is cool. I love the universe, it is such a mystery to me, it can be completely opaque, and yet still be cool.
Yes. It is strange to think about the Universe. There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe and that it is the only electron.
that is weird, also weird is that the universe may exist inside a black hole, kinda scary, the universe might exist inside of a black holes
I know right!  I wonder what they observe in that region of space that could be pulling galaxies apart?
That is interesting.. I did not know that.
The franchise has a history. In one year, in 2013, the first single playable character details were released on Super Smash Bros. history. That includes a character name, Switch, which includes the ultimate for Switch, the best selling game of the year. No other details werereleased.
Wow! That's so cool!  I wonder if it's as thick as the observable universe, strange how if you fold a piece of paper in half 109 times it is as thick than the observable Universe!  How cool
It is strange.  The character name waluigi was taken from a bizarro version of Luigi.  Good to know about the character's name Waluigi.
The sun is so fascinating, and I agree with you I think it is fascinating!
Absolutely! It is the center of our solar system, a hot star, the center, the hot star!
I wonder why it is white and not yellow.
I think it is because of the atmosphere.
I think it is due to atmospheric scattering. I was surprised to learn that if you survived a lightening strike, it is actually hotter than the sun. That makes it almost hotter than it was when it first struck us. I wonder how many of us have survived aLightening bolt, or due to Atmospheric scattering
Wow.  I didn't know that.  On July 11, 2011, it was discovered that it was the first full orbit around the sun when Neptune completed it's first full rotation around the Sun since it was first discovered in 1846.  Did you know that?
Wow, I didn't realize it's orbit was that long. I wonder how long it took. Shockingly, I never knew that the largest star in our galaxy was only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our own galaxy. I can only imagine the scope of the sun being 1 billionst the size!
The sun is really big, it's radius is around 330 million kilometers, that is very big for the sun
That is huge!  I can't wrap my brain around the size of it.  It is one billion times larger than the largest star discovered in our galaxy and the size is just too much.  I cannot wrap my head around that!
Me either.  William Shakespeare wrote about the sun, but I don't think he was famous for it.
Well, I think his work holds its own stock now.  Yes, he coined phrases and phrases that our world still uses today, like "laughing, laughing, laughing", "good riddance, good riddances, chase, chase! the wild-goose and the wildebeest! The devil incarnate and the full circle of brave yesterdays and brave brave today!
He also invented Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia as women, I didn't know that.
Oh, I was not aware of that. It's shocking that Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart. I find it even more shocking thatocahonts and shakespeare were alive the same year and we still find it shocking that they died
That is intriguing.  Jane Austen was also famous in the 1700s.
She wrote emma, the book that I am familiar with, I think clueless was based on her works, but I'm not sure what book that is.
She was also known for her novels that were written were rejected by three major publishing companies when they were written,
Wow! She must have felt stupid. I am aware that mark twain hated pride and prejudice. He is arguably the most famous for his classics. Are you aware that Mark Twain hated pride?
Yeah, he took the word literally as hyperbole.
I know.  Some people use it as a hate word.
It is interesting they pioneered a lot of them though.
I know right. How do you like it?
Hello - Shakespeare coined many of the phrases that are still popular today. They include "good riddance" and "good stock". He also popularized phrases like "laughing stock," "the devil incarnate" and the "wild-goose chase". Today's stock is full of such phrases. Shakespeare was a brave man, but the world has come full circle.
I did know that.  Pocahontas died only the year he was born.  I think she was around when he was only 10.
Yeah thats interesting.  I did not know that.  Polish composer andr. Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the yorick theatre theatre royal because shakespeare had a skull in it.  Kinda weird.
That's weird and also pretty cool that Shakespeare invented the names Olivia, Jessica, Miranda, and Jessica, pretty cool, and pretty cool how he used the names Miranda and Jessica.
Yeah, I had no idea he did that. I wonder if they were popular in the 1700s or if he came up with the idea himself?
Switching topics a little, the sun is actually white, only appears yellow because of atmospheric scattering and not because of its being white.
Interesting.  A lightening bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun, crazy.  I wonder why?
That is crazy, did you know that the sun produces enough energy to power our entire planet for 500,000 years in one second. That is enough energy.
Yeah, a lot of people in the area are converting to solar panels now and a lot.
It's definitely getting expensive, though. The sun is big, but it's only one billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy. And it's also only 1 billionth The biggest star ever seen on our sun is 1 billionst the size.
Yeah thats insanely huge!  I have some friends that have an apartment where they live and the bill is over $300 a month,  I wonder if I will get that bill if I go there?  Yeah thats insanely big!
I wonder how much they can afford to convert it to? Neptune just completed its first full orbit around the sun since it was discovered in 1846!
Yeah, that is one slow orbiting planet.
Are you a big movie fan?  I am a big TV and movie buff, but I'm clueless the movie fan in me.  I know that for instance I like Emma from "Emmi" but I was so young and really clueless about how clueless the movies were then.  lol  That was loosely based on Jane Auston, and it's loosely based in the 1960s.
Nice. I didnt know that. Mark Twain hated Jane Austen because of her Pride and Prejudice.
He also rejected it from three major publishing companies.
Interesting. I wonder why?  The word "literally" has been used figuratively for hundreds of years.  I know that charlotte bront, charles dickens, charlottes dickens. mark twain, and jane austen all use the word "seriously".  I think that is hyperbole.
Cool fact.  I saw that on the BBC.  Dark materials by Philip Pullman, Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy by Douglas Adams, Lord of the Galaxy, Tolkien's The Little lord of the Rings.  The BBC has it all.
Nice!  Those are great books!
Jane Austin's works critique the transition from "literary realism" to "literature realism" which is a sensibility that has been around for over a half of a century.  I think it's part of the transition, but I don't think it is my cup of tea.
It was great talking to you! Have a good one!
Did you see the Teen Titans movie that was given rave reviews?
That was awesome! Did you see it?
The reviewer really loved the music and sense of humor, he made a good point that it was for adults who are interested, and made a really good point as well that it would be a great book for anyone interested in it, the reviewer really loving the music
The original teen titans, film from a few years ago was fantastic, but I wasnt a big fan of that as a kid, I think it wasnt as good as the newer ones, I was more into cartoons and the original one from years ago, the first film, the original "Titans" from a little over 30 years ago.
I really liked stuff like Superman.  I was a sucker for LoWy tunes.  Interesting how the superhero genre has evolved though, I like the stuff from the 70's and 80's a lot more than the new stuff like DC stuff.  The 90's was interesting too.  Still a sucker For Looney Tunes!
I loved Daffy Duck alot, his antics. Tom and Jerry are the best! I think alot of medern day cartoons are based on the looney tunes too, like Tom andJerry and such.
I think that's so funny, Daffy and Bugs are timeless. I remember seeing him back in my adult eyes, way back then.  I remember when I saw Shaq in action as a player on the Looney Tunes character.  Tom and Jerry was a lot of fun too.  Did you know that Shaq is the best basketball player ever?  I think he's one of the best.  Daffies and Bugs is always funny!
I have seen that movie, its a classic its called spacejam, I also like Michael Jordan shoes, they made an edition of the Jordan shoes with all the best of the Michael Jordan's in them, they are a classic
Hah! That's reminiscent of the kind of movie they can't make nowadays. I wonder if they framed Roger Rabbit? I like the superhero stuff they can make nowadays, but not the superhero movies.
I think that was one of my favorite childhood films! I like the actor who played the scientist doc in back in the future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, he was the actor that played the Scientist Doc in Back to the Future!
I have not. I thought it was good, but I was mad they killed off Chris Pine's character. I liked him much better when he was younger. superhero movies have taken a darker turn lately, taking a grittier and grittIER take than I thought. I like when they killedoff Chris Pine, but that seems like it's taken a dark turn.
They have recently really started taking a darker turn and it started with movies like Spawn and Dark Knight, but then Batman Begins, Dark Knight Rises, and Batman: The Last Batman are all movies that have recently taking a dark turn as well.
Yep.  I like how DC gets the publicity and produces such a consistent, consistent and good stories.  It's neat the way it flows between the worlds, like Batman Vs DC versus Marvel, and the movies that have Wonder Woman appearing in them all.  They're all good stories with a lot of neat Batman vs. DC movies.
I like Marvel too! I like Marvel better though.
It's hard to say. I like both. DC has a lot of good stuff. Marvel has produced so much good stuff that its hard to keep in mind. I kind of like the latest Avengers movie. I started to figure out that Superman is going to recover from dissolving in half in the latest avengers movie. Wonder how they figure that out.
I love Marvel. I'm a big fan of Ironman and Hulk and the original series, and the Spiderman films. I am not a big supporter of the new ones, but it has definitely been downhill from their original series.
Marvel keeps reinventing themselves and rebooting their characters current and former movies.  I guess that's what happens when they turn 100 year old and have to turn to print a new novel.  It's interesting how they do that.  They're kind of like the old stories, but they're rebooting them into new stories.  Do you read the comics, or are you familiar with the movies?  Marvel keeps reinvented themselves, I guess.
I do like their rendition of the Joker though. I think it was better than the comedic one they did with Suicide Squad.
Joker is a real psychopath and a realopath at that.  Batman is a different movie.  I think that movie was going to be made years and years ago, but they never did!
I loved the first one, I think I was 13. Jack Nicholson's rendition of the batman was so fantastic.
The Nicholson Joker, Heath ledger's Joker, was so campy and funny as Batman! Adam West was sooooo campy too.  I think the best of the series was the Heath Ledger Joker.  The whole Nicholson Joker was so funny.  Did you ever see the TV series "Gotham?
Gotham had a better job then Suicide Squad, I think. Will Smith and Harley Quinns characters really saved that film.
That is true Harley Quinn was the best character in that movie, I really liked her character in the Smith play.  I think she is the Joker's daughter, or at least the daughter of the Joker.
He played Deadshot go watch the film, its on Fmovies or Solarmovies google it
I will have to check it out.  I wanted to see if I could check out a punisher binge.  It's been a while since I've seen any of his real work.  But I recently saw the one with Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Luke Cage.  My son was watching it with me and it was really dark.  Dark is the best way to feel at the time.  He wanted to go to gotham to see Jessica Jones.  So he went to watch the real one.  After watching the real real one and the punisher, he said "I'm going to have to watch this again!"  Woo hoo!
I would watch them all, but the Punisher film was a masterpiece give it to me to watch it because it was on a nother level.  It's too dark for me, but it was a great punisher film.
Hello, do you like superheroes?
Hmm...kind of like Superman and Batman type of as a kid but more of a comic book source.  I did enjoy the cartoons and TV shows based on those heros as a kids though.  Do you enjoy the shows based off the comic book sources or the TV shows?
I did love the 70s and 80s.  I would love to see that comic series about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheroes.
That one made me laugh a little bit. I like irony a little too much. I read about Stan Lee last year. He was a writer for a comics series that got a really good press and the writer of the comics died but I think a lot of it was irony.
Interesting, he wrote 15 DC Comics? I had no idea he did that, he did so many comics.
excelsior!  he ended every phone conversation with him with that character.  It sounded like he ended it with "excelSior".
Yes, he was.  He was a good guy and a funny one.  Did you know there was a spinoff of a Garfield book series named Pet Force, that had Garfield characters acting as superheroes?  It was a series of movies named PetForce, which is like a series about a Garfield character acting as a superhero.
I think that is very ironic and kind of a lend itself to the genre, it would be called comic books. The planet populated by superhero, non-super hero, normalman, is called planet populated By superhero. That is funny and ironic and Kind of a Weird Normalman if you ask me.
That is ironic.  I wonder where marvel takes place.
I wonder what the future will be like in a lot of years to come.  Astronomers say that the Earth's sun will run out of fuel and it will burn up and run out in the near future.  That sounds like a lot more fuel to burn than the money the origin movie maker needs to run out.  I wonder if WWI is still the highest-grossing origin studio movie.  Wonder Woman was the second highest- grossing origin movie in 2016.
I do like Wonder Woman. Pretty amazing it grossed more than $270,000,000 more than Wonder Woman itself.
I read that in the comics that she was originally the Justice Societie Secretary.  I wonder if that showed how sexist it was to read that?
That is sexist, I bet that wouldn't fly in our society today.
It's good for society for evolving. Gal gadot, the actress who played wonderwoman actually thought she was going to be Wonderwoman when she played wonder woman.  Wonderwoman actually did some testing for catwoman before becoming WonderWoman, the first female superhero switcharoo.  I wonder if she did the same testing for Catwoman, the second female superhero Switcharoo.
Wow, I didn't know that.  I wonder why that is.  Michigan State has the largest public comic book collection in the world.  It's in Michigan state, in the largest Public comic book collections in the US.
Yes Michigan State is quite big. I was unaware that they had one of the biggest comic book collections. I'm from Illinois and we have one of those big detective comics comics. The dc of dc comics stands for dc comic, but it's redundant. Michigan State must be a mecca of comic book collection, then.
I wonder who came up with that?  I know Marvel once published a generic comic book to trademark the names super-hero and super-villian.
Maybe they needed that baseline to see if stories in generic comic book was populated by a super-hero and a villain so that their lawyers could trade mark it. Maybe they could come up with stories ingeneric comic book where the super- Hero and the villain are the same, so the lawyers could Trade Mark it.
I wonder that too.  I wonder if female superheroes have a name, there is one called superheroine, do you know what it is?
I wonder why they use the name Super-heroine. I wonder if it's correct grammatically? It would have to be a different name with different origins. The name Superhero is the right name but it takes too many letters to pronounce. The original Japanese comics, which were the most popular, were actually comic books. They were sold in 18th century Japan and were the first comic books to be available in the US.
Good talking to you!  Have a good one!
Hi, have you seen the Wonder Woman movie?
Yea, Patt Jenkins did a great job directing Wonder Woman
I was surprised to find out that it was the highest grossing superhero origin movie.  It is also the second highest grossed superhero origin film.
Gal gadot did a great job in the Wonder woman role, she really helped with the Wonder Woman role.
Yes she did.  I had no idea she was going to be in the role.  She served 2 years in the Israel defense forces.  Was surprised to find out that she had real life training as a soldier and even served for 4 years before she got the role!
Yea, I guess that training was put into great use since the movie takes place during WWI,
I wonder what the gal thought when she auditioned for the testing for catwoman.  lol.
That's pretty funny. Did you know the inventor of the lie detector Tes also created Wonder Woman?
I did not know that.  I read comic books when I was a kid.
Yea, I loved reading Garfield, it's funny they originally owned the gmail.com domain name, they had it since 1998
I loved Garfield!  I didn't know that!  Michigan State University's library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world.  I wonder how many people check it out.  They also have the largest public library of things in the World.  Did you know that?
I'm sure they do. I wonder if they have Marvel comics too. Did you know that the government X-Men had to spend 10 years convincing the U.S. government X-(men aren't human) and they are actually Marvel Comics?
lol that is crazy!  I wonder how they did that?
Pretty crazy! I wonder how much he was paid, I'm sure he made out big time. Superman was always paid well, but superman is always paid big time!
Wow.  I found out that dc comics stands for detective comics.  Detective comics?  I wonder why.
He invented the term!  He was a brainiac!  Pretty redundant though.
Nice!  Did you know there are over 300 registered superheroes in the USA?
That is petty crazy, but I suppose there are going to be 300 superhero movies released between 2016-2020, so there will be some superhero movies out there!
Wow that is a ton of money they are making! It will be funny when people stop watching it though, they will be full of superheroes and no one will know what to do, I think. A person with no superpowers can be called Normalman. He is the only normal person on the planet with nosuperpowers so he will be called "normalman". It will stop people stop watch them, they are already making a ton
I'm glad Michael Jackson didn't buy Marvel comics to play spiderman.
That would have ruined him. I wonder if he would have changed for the role if they had changed it. It was fun chatting! Have a good one!
Hi there, do you like movies?
Hi! I love movies! I like teen titans. What about you?
I personally never saw the movie, did you watch it?
It was about a superhero movie.
I love superhero movies. I think Wonder Woman is one of my favorite superhero movies and I will watch it, do you have any favorite superhero Movies that you like?
I love Wonder Woman! I was sad to see Stan Lee almost changed careers because of it.
I loved Stan Lee and all the comics he did in the 1960's.
I was very sad he passed away but he did such great work. He created Hulk, Iron Man, Iron man X Men, and so many more. I think he created Hulk for the movies too. He could never live down to his name.
True. He also produced wonder woman and also produced Wonder Woman.
I am not sure, but I think it is funny that the womans invisible jet was given a special viewing at the Smithsonian for the day of "Entertainment". Crazy! I would think the Smithsonian would have it in womans Invisible jet for a special views, right?
Correct!  By chance who directed Wonder Woman?  I believe it was the Chinese company Tencent Pictures (ratpac entertainment) or the Chinese Company Tencentpictures, which is also by chance whodirect Wonder Woman.
Yes, the screenplay was actually directed by Patty Jenkins.
Yes it was, Patty Jenkins is the actress that was playing Wonder Woman.
Gal Gardner.  I know that she was played by Robin Wright.  He had a great cast.  Chris Pine, Chris Hemsworth, Danny Huston, Chris Evans, Chris Sullivan - all great in their roles as a superhero.  Robin Wright was in it a while ago too.
I think she is good, in fact Wonder Woman is the highest grossing superhero movie and the highestgrossing superhero film ever!
Wow, that's pretty impressive. I saw her in the Lego movie, but I didn't know it was the first feature film to do so. I also didn't think of it as a Lego movie.
Gal gadot served in the military in israel. she is from there.
No idea, I don't think so.  lol  I do like comic books, my favorite as a kid was the 70s comic books.  How about you?
I love comic books and I served in the Israel Defense Forces.  The Hulk is my favorite.
I like superhero comic books, I really like Batman and Spiderman and Pretty Woman. I'm a big fan of the new Wonder Woman movies and also the Teen Titans movie, Batman and spiderman, and I like the new TV show, The CW show, Superheroes, and the new Teen Titans Movie.
I have watched Teen Titans.  We are told that there will be more at some point based on the amazing performance by Gal Gadot in Wonder Woman.  But I am not sure if Wonder Woman is done.  I think she is going to be in another movie at some time.
I think Wonder Woman is a great one. I know that many people have enjoyed Teen Titans and the other superheros in the movies.
Thank you for your input.  It was nice chatting with you.  Bye.
You too! Thanks! I'll see you later!
Hi! Do you like comic books and superheroes?
I do! Who is your favorite superhero?
The Punisher because he is human and insane lol.
He is human? he is batman, he has crazy skills, he is human and also a batman?
I thought Wonder Woman was good, but I don't like movies, but it is the highest grossing one so far.
I didnt like them both I think I prefer the Nolan trilogy, Wonder Woman was good I agree, but I have seen it all 3 times already, I liked it all the times, but i prefer the nolan trilogy,
Gal gadot served in the Israel defense forces. I didn't know that. I wonder if she has done anything with law.
Wow!  She was in the movie "The Last Movie".  I bet she makes the dangerous stunts in the next movie she's in.  She is 25 years old.  I wonder if she will do it again?
Yes, she did. She also joined the Justice League when the group made her its secretary.
I bet she was a little kick off being the secretary, she made them look so funny lol, I would be in kick off if I made someone like that lol.
Haha too funny! There are more real life superheroes than there are registered names of real life superhero's!
Really? That is a lot of creativity.
Yes, it sure is.  I would like to check out Michigan State Library.  It has the largest public comic book collection in the world.  Wonder if any of them have superpowers?  Maybe I could check out MIchigan's state library.
That would be a great place to start! Did you know there was a comic series about fixing collateral damage?
I remember hearing about that! I think he did a really bad job as a normalman haha.
I would like to be normalman too! I don't think I'm aware of what a normalman is or what a hero lol.
I think its a person without superpowers, I think that is a little different, but a planet full of superheroes lol.
Sounds like a hard job lol, that would seem like a disadvantage but it sounds like a lot of imagination, Stan Lee had a lot to do with that, he created normalman, it takes a lot, Stan lee had a hard time with that and he created Normalman
I agree. Stan Lee ended all phone conversations with "Excelsior!" That is so funny! I wonder if Stan Lee end of all phone conversation was to agree?
That is funny and also very sad, he is dead now, I heard he wrote over 50 comics, I want to find out wich one, I am sad I have to find them to findOut wich ones, I like comics.
Have a great day!  Have a great one!
Did you know that Google is going to keep creating it's own Google?
I know that Google is doing AI and self driving cars but not what they are creating. I dont even know what self driving car is.
Google is a big company impacting lots of people's lives, I worry, they will always be a bigCompany,
I wouldnt have to worry about it, I wouldnt.
I'm not sure. Google had a point when it went down for 5 minutes and took 40% of web traffic with it.
That makes sense lol. I shouldnt worry though because we have self driving cars as articial intelligence, so we shouldntorry
I wonder if they'll try to mimic and learn human functions one day?  That would overpower them or they'll just mimic andlearn human functions better.
That's cool.  kinda sounds like a conversation I should have.  Interesting.  Thanks for the conversation.
I wonder how they can be programmed?  A robot that is designed to carry out a conversation can be programming by a computer or a computer that is programmed.  So, it could be a human or a robot.
Yeah, it's pretty weird. Hint: the robot will be an automated answering service.  Some companies have already done it.  It's pretty crazy that a robot could do that.
Yes, robots are actually developing. Facebook is using them on Facebook.  I think they are kind of like us.  We can understand emotions and identify stuff.  But they are developing to be able to understand emotions more and more.
I hear Google Artificial Intelligence class uses Google Hangouts to teach more efficiently.
I wonder if Stanford's free artificial intelligence class uses those hangouts to teach more effectively.
I think Kristen Stewart co authored a paper about artifical intelligence.
I wonder if google ever read that?
I am not sure, I wonder too!
Google employees like to improve their knowledge by reading.
Maybe, robots can be controlled by using rat brains, they can also be controlled using them
I had heard that.  I wonder if their personality is changed depending on the brain.
Interesting, I didn't know that!
Nice chatting with you!  Goodbye.
Hello, did you know Google has been around for 15 years now?
Me too, it has grown pretty fast. I love YouTube, too.
Me too, I use it a lot. Do you use google maps?
I do, I use it for most of my around the town trips I make, what about you?
I do a lot of that too. I have to be in familiar places and be in order to get around. I get in traffic in the familiar places too often and if the road is in order, there is always an accident.
It did cause a big uproar by users when they went to use google.
I would like to witness that for myself.
I have not.  I have recently been able to witness Youtube going down.
Wow, that's not good.  I use youtube to create my gym playlist, and I know some of the facts that google used to have on Youtube.  It took 40% of web traffic with it.  That's about 30 minutes of all web traffic.
I saw that Google CEO testify before congress recently.
I did, I think he was testifying about how they are tracking phones.
I can't recall but it seems like it was a question about Facebook. I remember a senator embarrassing themself over a question like that, I think. I don't remember a Senator embarrassing them selves though.
I saw the clip, it was a comical way of trying to explain to some gov't officials how the internet works, and it's just too comical for me to comprehend lol. I don't know how the gov officials don't explain it better than anyone else.
Well, the government is shutdown today because they couldn't get an agreement and now our government isshut down.
I don't know, it's just that we don't have a smart tech CEO in office, and it seems like every day is a new day.
Yes, we could.  The Google CEO seemed articulate and impressed that he was in elected office.  I wonder how he did.  Google CEO is an elected office...
I think the younger guys will have a hard time convincing the older generations to vote for the older guys.  The older generations are likely to have a really hard time convinced.
Maybe they could use Google more, they have content from all things other than the government and the content of the government.
I do too. It's interesting that Google has its own maps based on the border claims of each country, and they can tell where the different border claims are on the maps based off of that.
I wonder what they are dealing with with the border wall on Google maps. Is this a border security issue on Google Maps?
I think I have looked it up. I don't think I ever looked at the specific area, but I'm sure the maps are updated for every specific area.
I think I will have to Google it.
Have you heard about Google duplex?
No, I haven't heard about that. What is it?
I have, I used it a bit. Apparently it is a human-sounding voice assistant.
That is cool.  I like seeing John Legend make reservations on it.
It's troubling that he has a voice that sounds more like a human than a human.
It is scary!  Reminds me of black mirror.
I have not seen that either, but I think Google is a lot like that company I like a lot!
I do, I prefer dogs over cat, but the stock price has gone up and down. Do you prefer dogs?
Interesting.  A google search takes more computing power than NASA in the sixties.  Thats more computingpower than NASA.
I did not know that.  I didn't know they owned youtube either.  That would make sense if they owned both.
So true! When Google went down for 5 minutes in 2013, it took 40% of web traffic with it.
Yes, and they once used goats to mow their corporate headquarters instead of using goats to Mow their own headquarters
Thats funny.  Did you know they use android devices to determine traffic for maps?  I wonder how they do that?
I wonder if they ever manipulate boarders? I think there was a dispute over a manipulated boarders once
It's amazing how far artificial intelligence is coming from Google.
Yes it is. Did you know there are self driving cars in the world?
I wonder if they will ever use google hangouts for anything else, I know that many in Stanford use Google Hangouts for their learning.
Do you like Hangouts?
Yes, I have, I did have a session with the grant imahara from mythbusters, what about you?
That's cool. Do you know Kristen Stewart?
Yes. Talk about a "who's who"
I would like to too. I wrote a paper on AI once and I thought her capable but I was wrong.
Robots and other people are surprising us sometimes. I saw a video of her deboning a chicken and she did it with robots. Very cool.
Wow that is gross! I have a weak stomach, and I don't like robots! The US military has their own eod robots, and even use an xbox controller for the XBOX 360.
Thanks for the chat, I'll check out the site, there is a non-profit that helps with the advancement of the site.  Check it out.  It is a not-for-profit.
Hi, ready for a chat?  I want to talk about the guitar and the chat.
Hi, love guitars!  I love the way the strings look on the guitars! guitars are fretted instruments, and the strings are usually 3 string guitars, but some guitars are Fretted instruments.
12 string guitars, I wonder what would be the best job for someone who only had six string guitars?
That's funny!  Guitars are played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers of one hand while simultaneously fretting with the hand.  That would be cool.  You could also use a pick to play with your hands by Strumming with one hand.
I seent it's not plucked with finger, toes, tongues, or tongues.  It's plucked by strings, fibs or just the fibs of the guitar itself.  Jimi Hendricks guitar was the first guitar to have teeth and not just strings.
That is cool! I love that hendrix music has a sound where the vibrating strings are projected either acoustically or electrically, so that the sound of the music can be heard.
I figure the acoustic part is pretty good, but the electrically is not as sexy as it looks.
When Eddie Van Halen recorded the guitar solo for "Beat It," he literally set the studio speakers on fire.
That's a passion that will never go away. He is a budding pyromaniak, he destroyed perfectly good equipment.
Speaking of Eddie van Halen, did you know he played that solo for Michael J. who played that Solo for Michael as a favor and free of charge?
Eddie probably didnt have the money for the tix and the equipment to go to all of Michaels shows so he owed him some money. Eddie set fire to the glove that Michael wore on one of Michaels shows and took the equipment with him.
Freddie Mercury cancelled a duet with Michael is pretty wild, but Michael insisted on bringing a llama to the studio.  Freddie Mercury cancelled the duet because Michael insisted he was bringing a Llama to a studio.
Michael had a sixth sense for such things.  I dont think Mike was always communacated with the animals.  He had friends among animals but they dont have a sixthsense.
I know he did.  I like some animals but Michael wanted to buid them away.  They say that there is a 50 foot robot of himself that can roam the Nevada desert.  A robot that can do anything to the animals but michael wanted to Buid them off.
Lol. Eddie Van Halen would set it on fire.
That would be cool.  I loved Michael.  His popularity helped to bring the channel MTV to fame.
Yes, Michael is a true hero.  He is going to be remembered in a 50 feet statue of a llamas 10 feet from the dessert with a dessert for all humans.  A llama is a great example of a true heroes, a true Hero.
I think so.  Michael's distinctive sound and style has influenced many,many other famous artists in different genres, like robot and moonwalk dance.  I think that the artist has influenced  many.
A robot could carry him around like a giant, a tradition since the 1950's, moon walking, a robot could carrying him like a dessert and roaming around moon walking.
I've forgotten that the Bart Simpson hit song "By the Time You're Forgotten" was written by Michael J. Bartman - a massive Simpson's fan. It was written in 1969 and written by Mike, a massive Simpsons fan.
Michael has touched so many many people in many times.  I miss his genius.  He cast the shadow of the 20 feet robot, but it was only 2.7 tall.  The shadow of his genius will always cast a shadow over everything Michael has touched.
Yes, he was wonderful! Nice chatting with you!
Good morning! Are you a fan of Michael Jackson's music?
Yea I like some of his bigger hits like Thriller and Beat It, but I don't really like his new ones.
Me too!  Did you know he wrote the song "Bartman" for the Simpsons?
That's pretty cool. I knew he wanted to do a guest voice in a harry potter musical but I didn't know he did a guest role in a Harry Potter musical
Interesting. Freddie Mercury also cancelled a duet with him once because he was insissted on bringing his llama to the studio.
Weird dude. I'm shocked Steve Spielberg wanted to play Peter Pan in Hook.
Honestly, I can't see him doing that.  That is creepy.  I think he was too creepy. He was way different back in the early 90s.
Michael is in the band TOTO, and I agree. I think the only non-creepy one is the recorded thriller he did for the band Toto, which I agree is very creepy, but I think it's better than the first recorded thriller.
Fair point. He wanted to build a 50 foot robot of himself and wander the nevada desert.. heh! interesting. He could wander the Nevada desert.
I wonder how much he would have to invent for that one.  I know he would not be the first robot to do the moonwalk.
That would be awesome to watch.
Yea and it's ironic that Jackson popularized the robot dance and wanted to build a robot lol.
I wonder if he could make it sing?
I'm actually kinda glad his brothers Jackie, Tito, and Marlon didn't share his vision of making it a robot.  I think they were a little too "robot" for him. I like Jermaine better though.
I am glad they didnt lol.
I am more interested in the mute man who was able to communicate via piano in England.  He was a mute man and was able  to communicate thru piano in england
I'm interested, I'm not very good at it though lol, so I'm interested!
I don't know.  I don't think I could play it, but I would like to play it.  Some people are really odd.  Like Richard Nixon who performed a piano concerto on the Tonight Show.
I know!  In 1930 the BBC decided that they would play music instead lol
That is pretty cool.  I wonder what the tree of the piano Mozart and Haydn made for the piano they used.  It was a piano MozART and HayDN made?
apparenly british climbers found a piano on the highet peak of the peak of a highet
That's spooky. It was so nice chatting with you.
Hello there,do you have a favorite instrument?
Guitar and piano, how about you?
Nice. Van Halen once set the speakers on fire while playing the guitar. I wonder how he did it. I can't believe Van Halens once set them on fire.
Wow, that is amazing. Do you know who brian may is?
Yes he is the lead guitarist of the queen and a genius scientist, he is also a genius
Yes and he has a degree in astrophysics and a PHD which is impressive
Matthew Bellamy from Muse?
Yeah the guy holds the record for most guitars smashed on a tour with 50 guitars smashed.
That is insane, must be a lot of money, Brian from Queen uses coins as his picks, I wonder why?
I wonder how that would work.  I wonder how the piano would look?
I love the piano. Did you know that in 1930 the BBC only played piano when there was no newsworthy news?
I wonder how many songs have only had mercury and mccartney on the piano in their songs
I heard that, I like Bohemian Rhapsody and Hey Jude the best!
Yeah, I have, I like the song called Circus Gallop and I really like Heat, do you like that song?
I have not but there is a song about it. I do know that there is also a piano that can be stress test piano and can't be played by humans.
Cool.  I wonder how that came about?  There is a piano that was found in the highest mountain in Britain and it's a piano in the mountain.
wow, who put it there? I wonder if it is Michael Jackson?
Yes he had amazing music.  I know it was supposed to be a duet with Freddy Mercury and it would have been amazing.
Yeah and he insisted on bringing his llama to the studio with him.  Michael said he did not want to be alone with him and he was not going to let him, so he insisted upon bringing his Llama to go in the studio.
Yeah that would have been a great hit.  He also helped write the soundtrack for Sonic 3 and that was a great one.
Pretty cool.  He also built a robot that can roam in Nevada desert that can do it all, he built a robots that can roaming in Nevada
Hi, how are you?
Good! Thanks for asking. How are you today?
Hello, I'm doing well thank you. Do you know a lot about Google?
Not too much, but I know that it is a huge company, and most people are much more involved in it than average, more than most people would think.
Yes, they are. A single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong and eleven other astronauts to the moon.
Holy cow!  That is crazy!  I guess they also use Android devices to calculate traffic by seeing how fast they are moving on the road.  They have to be really fast on the Android Devices to calculate that.
Google once tried hiring people to mow the lawns around their headquarters, but instead of using hundreds of live goats, they used hundreds oflive goats.
Cool.  I wonder what happened to the goats?  I have to look that up.
They must have transported them to a farm nearby tomake goat cheese and milk. I think they have a farm near tomake Goat cheese and Milk.
That is awesome.  I feel so out of place.
I love it!  Do you know any facts about it?
I know that I know IBM Watson is in the medical field and others like that.
Did you know on august 16th, 2013 google went down for five minutes, and took 40% of web traffic with it. That was for 5 minutes!
That's like if it happened today!
I would guess it would be 60-65%
Yeah, I think so. Google's stock price was so high in 2012 that it's now at $1,200.
Yes, I bought in 2006 when they bought them out.  I like how Google maps tailors its maps to the claims of each country where the internet browser is located, especially when there is a disputed border.  When there is no disputed border, google maps tailORS its maps according to the country where your internet browser would be located.
yeah, I should've tried buying amazon instead, they are the biggest one now, Facebook is second, they keep buying amazons, and they are getting bigger.
Amazon would have been the best buy if they had bought it, I don't know what they would have done with amazon.
Yeah, I think I bought in at $50, lol. I wonder where stocks will finish this year? I'm not sure.
I think they will put up to 2-3 times more, but I like to put my old stocks on sale at least once a while, they are a cheap stock.  What do you think?
I agree, I am hoarding some cash waiting to add to it.  But I will keep up to date on stocks and finance, like Roth said, I agree.  Thanks for chatting with me today, I will be talking to you later, have a nice day, keep up with stocks and Finance, and keep up on the news!
Hello, do you play any instruments?
Hi.  I play the guitar.  How about you?
Me too. I like the sound of it. Van Halen once set the speakers on fire by playing the guitar.
I heard that.  I like the solo he did playing the Beat It song.
That is amazing.  Brian May from Queen is also amazing.
Yeah he is a musician, a musician and also an astrophysicist to be exact, a scientist on top of a musician to be more exact
Yeah pretty cool. He used a coin to play his guitar
Yeah that is interesting. Pink Floyd has a grand houseboat that is a recording studio which is like a grand Houseboat and is used as their recording studio.
Amazing. Do you like piano?
I love the piano, such a classical instrument!
yeah and BBC did it in 1930 and played an instrumental of piano when they were giving away a piano, they played it for $25
I think that is amazing, I wonder what channel that is on. I heard it was a circus gallop, I think it was on the same channel.
I have heard of that. It is played by humans and was used to stress test the pianos. I wonder how they stress test them.
Yeah I did. There is a piano on top of the highest mountain in the UK.
Yeah, I wonder how climbers got it up there and found it, I'm not sure if climbers know what it is used for?
yeah I am not sure. do you know michael jackson?
I do like his music. He and Freddie Mercury were supposed to do a duet, but it was a duets.
Yeah, but Jackson refused, because he insisted on bringing his llama.  He went to the studio and Jackson insisted on bring his llamas.
Wow, that must have been an amazing song. It helped to the soundtrack for Sonic 3.
Wow! He built a robot of himself that can roam around Nevada desert! He even built a Robot of himself to roam around the Nevada desert, he did this in 2010.
Wow.  Nice chat!  I need to take flight now.  Thanks for the nice chat!
Do you have any pets? Japan has more pets then kids under 15 years old.
I do, I have a cat and I take care of pit bulls.
Neat!  I guess I am not one of those people who love cats. I guess it is common to hear that "Atheurophile" cats are called.  I wonder why.  Do you know why cats arecalled such?
I've heard that, but I've also heard of other "no" dogs that people are willing to adopt.  I've been able to adopt dogs thatPeople who have downsized from a house to a house are not allowed to have dogs in their apartments.
I've heard of that before, its actually an interesting fact, people who love dogs are known as cynophiles, I think its because of the people who are cynophilia, interesting fact
I've heard that too, I wonder why people think that? I wonder if they have kids, or if they own a pet like many people do?
It is cheaper, and easier for them to care for.  Small pocket pets are also easier too.
I wonder if rodents are any better?
Yeah, I have hamsters, rat, and rat, but not rats. I think rats would be nicer as a pet, although some people do like hamsters.
My cat brought in a flying squirrel a few weeks ago and I had to kill it.  She is a little different than a squirrel.  I used to have a flyingirrel when I was little, but that was a while before my cat brought it in.
Wow. exotic pets are cool. I wonder if they are wild in the wild or not? I think there are some in Asia that actually pet tigers, but I don't think they have a flying squirrel, but exotic pets like the flying squirrel.
I remember seeing a flying squirrel, but I don't remember it being a tiger.  I wonder if my daughter works for a vet and they have a flying Squirrel?
Interesting! I have a pet lizard, I use to have a huge cage for it, I think it hides a lot, I would like to see it one of these days, maybe one day, it's like having a pet snake or something. It has its own huge cage and it hides
Cool, I had a pet turtle for a while, he worked with the guy that had the first pet turtle, it was really cool.
I know, turtles live forever. I love talking about pets! I just gave up on my pet when I moved. I used to have one. I really love talking to you!
I miss my dogs too.  I adopted my dog from the vet, and we have a farm that has a farm where we keep them.
Time to adopt a new dog!  I have a parrot but he is not as old as my dog.
Dogs are ok, but I have two dogs.  I used to live in DC where the dog and cat were friends but I was not allowed to have them.
I think that's the future! Speaking of the future, did you ever watch Harry Potter? I liked the books and the movies but never saw them on tv.
I like the first book better, but the second book was better, The Witch and the Wardrobe, the movie was really good I also read the Lion and the Witch, the third book was ok, but not as good as the first
I like the movies, but I have to say I haven't seen it. In any case, it was translated from British English to American English, so it is a different language that is translated from british english to american english, so not sure if it was better or not.
Yeah, did you know what is called a buggy is also called a cart?
Time to watch the movie now. Bye.
It was good to chat with you!
Do you have a pet?
I do, I have a dog, and a cat, they are the most popular pet, the most, the cat is the second most popular.
Wow, I figured a dog would be the cat! I heard that the first cloned pet was a cat, I wonder if it was the first. I figured that it would have been a dog. I wonder what it was?
I knew they cloned a cat, but never knew theyCloned a dog.  I also knew they had a hamster, but in Hawaii, it is illegal to own a hamSTER.  Odd.
That is odd!  I would clone my dog koko and have it clone myDog Koko.  She dies so often and I can't keep her if she dies.
Awww, that is so sweet. People with pets are at a greater risk of having a natural disaster because of a natural one, so people with pets may be at a much greater risk
I bet they don't know. I tend to think back to the law in Colorado about pets. Did you hear about that? They tend to be against the law there, but I don't think it is a law in the US. I didn't hear about the law about pets here in the U.S..
What is the law about that? I think the risk is pets make it more likely we will evacuate, right?
It is kind of funny.  It is legal to be the guardian of a pet, but not a pet.  I think it is kind to be a guardian.
That is a strange one. What kind of species keeps pets?
I never knew that. I think I knew there is a species that does, but I am not sure what species.
It's a species of tarantula that uses ants for their eggs, and frogs, and also ants to use for their Eggs.
Lol that is awesome,  smart and very smart.  I hear there are tigers that are more smart than tigers in the wild.
Yes, I did know that. People keep pets because they have relatable personalities and are willing to keep them.
Interesting!  Are you a harry potter fan?
No, not really but I like J.K. Rowling is an author that is universal.
I loved those rides! Harry Potter was born there!
The main idea of the novel is the struggle between Potter and Lord Voldemort.
Yea, it would be a crazy battle to watch!  It was nice chatting with you!
You too.  J.K Rowling also wrote an alternative HP ending, pretty odd.
Wow! I would love to see it if it were released. I wonder when it would be released. Well, enjoy your weekend!
Hello, do you like jazz?  Do you know where it originated?
I love jazz music. I actually studied it in school a couple years like Tupac.
I think it is cool jazz has been around since it was developed in the 1920's, I can't believe it has been that long.
Nice, I hear it always sounds so good. I like Louie Armstrong's beat it, it was the one that got the Beatles top spot in 1964, I think it was Louie Armstrong beat them for the Beatles top spot.
That's pretty crazy but jazz is pretty popular. There is a chart toping jazz orchestra in Pakistan, that's pretty popular too.
I would love to hear that, I wonder if Abe Lincoln liked jazz or if it is just his style?
I'm not sure. He had a high pitch voice.
I never knew that. I wonder if it's a good honor to be in the wrestling hall of fame though, I know that it's not for music, is it?
Nice!  Apparently Lincoln created the secret service the morning after he got shot, I guess he was the one that created the day after he created the Secret Service.
wow, that is eerie. Lincoln had a bartenders license, I wonder if that helped him out, maybe he helped get a bartender's license
Lincoln must have kept important documents inside his hat.
That's a large hat. He kept a lot of stuff in that hat. I wonder if he had a birth certifcated in it too? He shares a birthday with Charles Darwin and he had the same large hat! LOL
That's pretty cool. John Wilkes' booth's father was named after Ceasar's assassin, that's prettyCool too.
wow that is eerie! Almost as eerie as Lincoln getting his gettysburg address while suffering from smallpox. I would have been like Michael Jordan with the flu game lol, I would get the gettyburg address whilesuffering from small pox
Who knew!    Did you know Lincoln was the only president with a beard?   I never knew that.  I wonder who was the last president with the beard?
He had a sweet beard. I wonder if Abe had a favorite shirt. I'm sure he had a shirt. Maybe his favorite shirt was his favorite shirts.
I am not sure, maybe a button down shirt or something?  Do you?
LOL I agree!  At Billy Mays funeral they wore blue shirts and khaki pants.
I wonder if he was a pallbearer at Billy Mays funeral too?
Me neither.  Those are terrible colors to wear at a funeral.  I like plain shirts like Zuckerburg wears that cost less than $100 dollars and are just plain shirts.
Nice chatting with you!  Have a good one!
What's your favorite type of shirt?
I do not have a favorite one. In China, they used to wear them as they were the cultural revolution, and pop the collars.
Yeah I guess that was to be distinguished.
I guess it was. DO you know when polos were invented?
I believe they were invented by the tennis player Rene Lacoste.
Yes and the rest is history and it was adopted by everyone else too
Yeah. Do you know what the button down refers to?
Yes when the collar tips are fastened to the shirt, that is how the collar points are fastening
Yes. Do you know what the button down is?
Yes and the one fastened to the shirt?
Yeah. Do you know what the official attire in Hawaii is?
Yes it is the aloha shirt and it looks like jazz.
I do. Clint Eastwood is a lifelong enthusiast and so is MJ
Yeah, he does. A woman in Harlem hosts jazz concerts everyday in her home.
Yes she has done that for 20 years now
Yeah. I wonder if that's why so many popular jazz people have stopped going after it
Yeah. Do you know which country has the best jazz orchestras?
Yes that is Pakistan and they are currently topping the charts
Yeah. DO you know why trumpeters grow goatees?
Yes because it is more comfortable to play the trumpets
I guess so, I figure a good and easy way to do it
Good morning! How are you?
Hi, are you a fan of jazz?
I do like it, I listen to it often live, but I don't get to listen to much of it.
Neat. Did you know Jazz originated in New Orleans?
Do you listen to jazz at all?
I do!  I didn't realize that it was referred to as America's classical music.
I didnt realize that either.  There are so many types of jazz.
The jazz age is well recognized as the major form of musical expression in the 20th-century, and is recognized as such by many.
What are you plans for christmas?
I am giving gifts to family.  I am not sure how much time costs, but I am giving shirts to my brother - a plain grey shirt.  Did you know that the shirt Mark zuckerburg wears all the time costs $100 and is also the shirt mark zuckerberg wears when he is with his brother.
Well I dont care if I have to pay that much money for a t-shirt, I dont want to pay $300 for a T-shirt.
The tee shirt was invented after he got his bachelors in 1936.  I wonder if he had to sew or replace buttons.
I would rather wear a tee shirt for work.  But, I still wear button down shirts.  Do you ever wear button up shirts?
I like to dress up in dress, too.  The shirt refers to the upper body garments, collared and cuffed, buttons, snaps, and other types of clothing.  It is collared, buttons down, and snaps.  British English (or American English) and British English, shirt refers only to upper body clothing.
I wish I lived in Hawaii. I could wear an aloha shirt instead of a suit and tie.
Oh nice, I wonder if shirts have anything to do with fashion.  It has changed over time, now most men's undergarment are known as shirts.
Yes, Abraham Lincoln dressed up in a suit. I guess a lawyer and politician in a Suit.
I wonder why he would do that, I wonder why we do things the same way?
Yes, John Wilkes Booth was named after one of the guys that assassinated Julius Caesar.
That is creepy. I also didn't realize that Darwin and the Lincoln shared a birthday.
Crazy stuff! Well I have to get going. Have a great day!
You too! Nice chatting with you!
Hi! Are you a big fan of watching films?
i used to be, but during my student time I watched a lot of time I'm watched a much more. now I watch on TV.
I am a big fan of comedy and action films.  I like Pineapple Express and Tropic Thunder, Wrinkle in Time.  My kids like them too.
I have seen the trailer.  I think it was from the 70s.  Changing a topic a little, Disney tried to make the older than 4 year movie in the 70's films like Bambi more realistic with a special multiplane camera and that was to make them look like the old films like bambi.  They used a specialMultiplane camera to make this 4 year old film look more like a 4 year year movie.
I did not know that, that is amazing.  I wonder which city Walt Disney studies is based on.
I know it is a city in Cali.  I think it was from a few years ago, but I'm not sure.
I went there in 2015 and I saw the Disney animated film directed by a woman from there, Burbank, LA.  It's also a famous airport.
Yes, it was by a scientist! I am surprised it was the first.  The term "scientist" was only coined in the 20th century.  I am not a regular "scientists" so I am really surprised by that term.
I wonder if the emperor of japan is also a scientist, the film is Frozen, he is the emperor and the film was done by a scientist.
No, who is it?  That is amazing.
It is, did you happen to know who coined the term scientist, Akihito?
I think the last time I heard of it was William Whewell, I think?
I had heard of him, he was the only scientist to walk on the moon, and the only one who did not go to the moon
I have no idea, but I do know Walt Dusney won academy Award for animation classic snow.
I wonder if Walt Disney would have liked it? I know he was very much into the animation industry. He says film is his superpower in the animation world.
Yes, I think so. He can do amazing things. In the movie, it took 24 million party balloons to lift Carl's House.
I think my favorite Disney movie is "Up" I love it. The grumpy old man is my favorite character. He is my most favorite character!
I liked them all as a child. I liked lion king the best. It was fantastic.
I completely agree the Lion King is an absolute classic Simba as a young man, its an absoluteclassic journey as a child and I completely agree with you on that one.
I know right, there are a lot of amazing facts about dysney, number 1 in the world, and number 2 in the US, a lot  of amazing Facts about dysNEY
It has basically made me think of my childhood.  It has everything.
Very true. It was my pleasure to talk to you.
Same here today and have a good day my friend watch a disney film if you see it.
Thanks! You too! Thanks for everything!
bye. :) :)   
Hi how are you?  Have you seen the movie "A Wrinkle in Time"?  It is coming out.  I have no idea what it is or if it is a movie.
That is awesome! It's going to be good!
It has Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling in it, I like her in that movie, what about you?
I can't wait to see it, what a star cast, I wonder if it is going to be another one of those?
I know!  The filmmaker, the filmmaker, seems eager to manage expectations.  At a recent screening of "A Child's Play" Duvernay urged filmgoers to "not let a taped prologue of the movie get you down" after a recent screenings.  She said that "it's a kids' film and it's a movie for kids."  I wonder how much worse it could have been.
I love Walt Disney Pictures. I saw the book not too long ago, it was very exciting. I love Walt disney pictures. What a treat!
Did you know that the Lion King was the first Disney film to be dubbed into Zulu for its african release and it was the only disney film to do so?
WOW that's interesting. Did you know that snow white earned disney an academy award?
Wow, the academy?  That is a cartoon?  Wasn't it a cartoon ?
I have no idea, but it is amazing that the first one was Black Panther. Animated films are so much better than real films, I think.
I have not, but I did see Frozen, the first animated Disney film directed by a woman and the first Disney film to do so.  Did you see it?
Wow, that is awesome! I have seen frozen too!
Disney is great.  In general, I like movies that use animation frames.  Did you know that Disney recycled a lot of their animation frames in the 70s, resulting in identical scenes in some movies, but Disney recycled the same animation frames?
The vultures in Disney's the jungle book were not designed to do that. It was originally supposed to be voiced by the Beatles.
I did know that.  In the beginning, the toy industry gets involved in disney animations before the film production.
Interesting, that is cool.
Yes, it was. I also learn that the Black Panther is the richest superhero.  It's estimated that he's worth $500 billion and Bruce Wayne is $100 billion!  Tony Stark is worth $80 billion andBruce Wayne is worth over $100 million.
Wow,  that is a lot of money!  I love marvel movies,  they have so many,  I have never seen them,  but want to.
I will have to catch up with black panther shortly, he is the emperor of Japan, and he is a scientist, he publishes papers, he was a scientist and he will become emperor some day, he will catch up to black panthers black pantHER shortly!
That's true. Ryan Coogler, the director of Black Panther, did an amazing job
He did a great job! I'm impressed with how he shoots the movie long before the script, dating back to the 1800s, and shoots with symbols and symbols he called out in the script. I think he did a really great job. The script was written by a guy who's from Nigeria and was called Nsibdi. It was written back in the 18th century and featured a black black man from Nigeria who is a present-day black man in a present day movie long after his date with his ex-wife.
That's interesting, Chadwick Boseman got his start in theater because he couldn't afford the summer theater program at Yale and Denzel Washington funded his tuition.
That's a great tidbit!  I wonder where it came from?
I love to see and hear about such facts like that, do you hear of any other facts you would love?
Disney's animated film "Up" started out with working titles in the late 1980s and started its development in the 1990s, spanning over three decades and more than 20 working titles.
Whoa that is awesome!
Marvel censored the utterance of "Panther" fearing backlash for the utterment, fearing a backlash for insulting the black community.  Marvel censored releases showing seemingly villainous character praising hindu god praise Hanuman.  The seemingly villainously praising god was a black character showing him praising black Panther.
That's interesting.  I wonder how it came about.
I wonder if Harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon?
Amazing.  I didn't know that.  It's illegal in queensland to name a rabbit after a scientist or a magician.  But the rabbit would be illegal in Queensland.
I did not know that.  What is that all about?  I have never been in Australia, but I've been to Queensland!
In Australia.  I think so.
What continent is that?  I have only been to this continent once.
It is the commonwealth of Australia. It's the second-largest and third-most populous state.
Wow, thanks for sharing with me.
No problem!  Did you know that the US Northern territory is bordered by the south-west and south Wales, and south Australia and the south Australia is b borders with South-west Wales, the South-West and South Wales?
Speaking of crazy, did you know that the first disney animated film to have working titles was "Wreck it Ralph"? The development of the film started in the late 1980s and spanning three decades and three working titles, spanning three different Disney animated film names and started in 1986.
wow that is crazy, I didn't even know that!
I would think if I had that much time and attention I would be talking to someone all the time and Attention!
Same here!  Thank you!
I can't wait for this chat to end, it's getting really awkward. I don't want this chatTo end.
hahahaaa... you are right, I will say.
Yeah, I live for it!
I live in the desert in TX.
I am in the Chicago suburbs, sounds warm.
Yep, I love it here.  I'm in southeast Iowa originally and it's winter here but I've never been in the winter before.
I can't tell the difference in weather there. We've had a mild winter here, but I think it's going somewehre warm.
That's great,  its cold here,  not great, but a good deal!  lol
Hi, are you a Walt Disney fan?
Not really.  I don't really get into the corporate culture that has gone into Disney's creations.
I enjoy the movies but I don't have kids so my enjoyment comes from my kids, but I loved the lion king. Did you know that it was the first Disney film to be dubbed into Zulu for its release in South Africa?
I remember being excited when I first saw the trailers, I forgot about this wrinkle in time, I never got around to seeing them.
I have not seen it but I want to see it! It is interesting though! Disney recycled a lot of the animation frames resulting in identical scenes in some movies, so maybe that is why.
That was a big period of reusable cells.
Yes.  Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman.
I wonder why Black panther was not advertised as a woman's movie? Are you into watching movies?
I haven't seen it yet.  I'm ready to watch it.  It's produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Disney and is available for free on the netflix.
I don't have Netflix, but I will have to check it out.  Netflix subscription costs $40.  I wonder how much that is.
I think it is fairly cheap, but only for the members who have the older kids who can share a Netflix account with someone.  Most people who use Amazon Prime have to pay $50 a month for the first month and then $30 for the next.  Black Panther, Black leopard, Black Panther and other movies I like are available for that, but the others are fairly cheap.  I have Amazon Prime so I can watch them on there when I can.  Do you have a Netflix accounts, or do you have two or three with older kids?
I did not know that. I wonder how much info on Netflix is available on that? I use Amazon Prime because it is a really good deal. Do you have any other info on Amazon Prime?
I think Netflix is probably cheaper,Month to month, but Amazon Prime is better.  I think that the price goes up from month to month.  Amazon Prime has better movies and shows, but I don't know if I would want to pay for monthly.  The price of a year of Netflix is $40 a year but I think I could get it for free with Amazon Prime.  In addition to the video streaming they have free 2 day shipping, which scientists say is the best use of day shipping.  Do you know if scientists know anything about this?
I do know some, I am curious to see how they get their news though, I know it has a dumbed-down science coverage, mainly in pop science journals I afraid, what do you know?
Haha, I do too. I was reading something about that today. I didn't know Akihito the emperor of Japan is a scientist and still publishes papers.
I bet he viewed it as a sacrifice for the throne, loved it, and a sacrifice to the throne.
Interesting. Did you know Harrison Schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon. Did Google tell you about him?
The Space shuttle opened things up for a wider variety of people. I always assumed the astronauts would be career fighter pilots. I assumed the Astronauts would be a wider range of people than just career fighter jets.
I thought that too.  Kind of what I thought too. I am bummed that they can't make those flights any longer.  Wow, I was workin in Switzerland and I was bummed to make out that the internet was invented by an English scientist.  He invented the world wide web so that the english scientist could make the internet faster than the US ones.
I think that was in Berners-Lee, UK, I assume that was his location.
Yes it was!  Well, it was nice chatting with you today!  lol
It is so sad that a 16 year old had part of his brain removed.
I have heard that people can recover, though.  Brain functionality can shift in different parts, and parts of your brain functionality can Shift.
I think it just feels normal to me.  If a kid can get rid of a part of his brain surely he can get away with consequences.  I don't know what he did as a kid, but getting rid of that part of the brain surely has its consequences.
 tanner is going to develop, I think he will have to go through therapy and then play certain sports and then he will be able to live a pretty normal life after that, hopefully he can develop a different way to play sports like tanner did.
Tanner is very interesting.  I heard his case was published in the scientific Yournal Cell reports.   I was very interested to learn that.  Have you heard of it?
He is an interesting case.  Do you like to play board games like chess?
I used to play. I'm not very good though. Do you play?
Same here. It is a complex game. There are more moves in chess than atoms in the universe. That is more chess than atom.
I guess that is why the world chess ferderation believes chess was invented by aliens.  I wonder who is the president of the world.  The world chessFerderation believe chess was created by aliens!
There is a negative correlation between the mind and intelligence, aliens, the mind of the mind, and chess, so I think there is no negative correlation. I would like to get an airbnb in my area, if I were aliens.
I wouldnt think there would be a correlation, but I wouldnt know, a good Chess player must require a big intellect, did you ever hear about the IQ and IQ and chess?
I think there is a negative correlation since there is no way to tell how tests measure different ability.  It's funny that a grandmaster beat a friend at age 5 and then beat him on the board at age 7.  I wonder how many tests measure that.  The grandmasterBeat a friend on the same board at 7.
I wonder if the official story about the Persians is that chess is in their blood, like they say.  lol  They say that it was created in India and only improved because of Persians...  I wonder if that improved it?  I think chess is the only one that has been created in india...
Are you a tennis fan?
Yes, I love tennis, I would love to wear polo shirts,they are so comfortable to wear,
Funny how the polo shirts originally designed for tennis players.  The inventor called them poloshirts because of the crocodile on them.  I wonder why the inventor called it that.
It was Lacoste who used the crocodile as brand logo.  A black man won the first US Open Tennis tittle in 1968 and was the first black champions.  Back then there was no black champions, but now there are two.  I wonder why Lacostea used the Crocodile asbrand logo?
I guess there was no problem there, lol.  I can't recall any either!  I think it's funny that in 1969 Arthur Ashe used a helicopter to dry the grass.  A rich man's solution to a problem, I guess.  LOL.
Thats funny,  and weird lol  I like tennis too!  tennis is so boring sometimes.  It's also weird how the match extends over 4 hours because the players keep going and going and the match is still going.  Weird lol
It must really focus the mind and a bit of the mind for the match, but it takes a bit to keep it together.  I wonder how much prize money they get for a match that last for 11 hours.  There is one where it takes place for 3 days and takes place in a place.
I know right!  lol  And no audience!
Did you hear about the boy that had to have part of his brain removed due to a tumor?
I had not heard about that. What did he do?
I think it was twelve. He had some problems with his vision, fairly normal. He is in therapy and avoids contact sports. He has been fairly active since then and has no problems with it.
I can't imagine how that operation worked for him. He had his brain removed.
It must be very hard, it is fairly impressive and shows how advanced the medical field is, things like playing volleyball and tennis are. It takes 6 months or more to recover and he could be doing things like that, that is fairly impressed and shows that he can recover.
It is impressive and very amazing that he was capable of doing those things when he was only 17, he is just amazing.
The longest tennis match in history was 11 hours and was played over 3 days, spread over 3.5 days, that is an amazing feat, tennis has been around a long time, over 100 hours is a longtime to be played,
11 hours and they purposefully missed the ball lol, like they purposefully missing the ball LOL
I know the US Open is important match.  They used a helicopter to dry the grass court for one.  That was in 1969!
i forgot about the US Open match. i think that is the sport I watch the most. i wonder who was playing in it. i would think that they would have actual important matches in tennis.
I don't know, its not a sport I pay much attention to either. Williams sisters are the inspiration for the sport. The first black man to win first place in the US open won it in 1969. The Williams sisters were the inspiration.
I read that he used to train every single day with his father and I never knew there was such a man.
Maybe he did, or maybe he had a natural talent for the game like Gael Monfils who was able to play just a few days after learning how to play.  He beat the "Roger Federer of paddle tennis" in just a days afterlearning the game.
I wondered the same thing.  I wonder if paddle tennis was an activity that was odd enough for his sisters to excel at orPing-pong was the same way.  It's an odd name for a activity.
I think table tennis or something like that.  Playing either of them would take a certain level of concentration that you would need to play a game of chess.  I don't know.  Do you play a games?
I had no idea it was called table tennis.  But I can believe it.  I wonder how the concentration and the amount of adrenaline you would feel playing a game like that.
Yes, you are right. A 17 year old beat a family friend at chess and was the only one to get on the board.  It was a case of natural talent.  He beat a lot of people.
That is a natural talent, good memorization skills, I would have loved to watch that happen!
I know!  It would have been a lot of fun winning against that kid.  The President of the World Chess Federation thinks that the game was actually invented by aliens or something.  Did you know that the Gupta empire and the game itself can be traced back to the Gupta's?
I have a feeling the name of the game of chess was invented by aliens.
Maybe the aliens came back after the Persian Empire, but they did not arrive in the 1800s and the game was improved by the Persians when the aliens come, or maybe the aliens did not come back at all and the games were improved after they arrive.
Have you heard about the man who had his brain removed? He was only 50 year old and had it done last year
Yes, I have. That is pretty crazy. He must be perfectly normal. I wonder how it feels.
He had surgery 2 years ago and now he has adapted a bit better.  He feels normal and doesnt have as many problems as he did two years ago,  I think its great that he has adjusted and feels normal,  and doesnt need more surgery.
Yeah, and the past few decades with medical technology have been absolutely amazing!  It's absolutely amazing.
Our bodies have to adapt, we have to Adapt and we can't always get everything we want.  I had my sciatic nerve removed due to cancer, but now my body has regained most of it's hamstring function and I've had my Sciatic nerve Removed due to Cancer.
Awesome, the human body can be an amazing machine but it has its issues.  The boy can't adapt to everything, theres just too many blind spots, the body is an amazingmachine but it does have it's issues.
Yeah.  It seems that the brain stepped in to help him out when his left side couldn't function on his left.  I think his brain stepped into the function in his left brain.
Interesting, he lost a lot of motor function, he got his sciatic nerve removed and then also lost a bunch of motor functions, he had to have his sciata nerve removed.
Yeah I can't feel my foot and can't move it, but I can feel my calf, I have no feeling in that part of my calf.
Boy, that's cool! I guess an event like that can really change your whole perspective, and keep you in good spirits, or at least the good spirits.  I think it's cool that you can change your own perspective.
I figure getting mad or not doesnt change anything, it just changes your attitude.
True, kind of like the spec that there is no such thing as time wisely, the universe is too important and we do not have enough time, we need to use our time wisely.
True.  I've been listening to some podcasts about the universe today.  How are you doing in the universe Today?
There is so much cool stuff you learned.
I was on a podcast and they started talking about the end of the world and the universe and the podcast was about the world as we know it now.
Yeah, I heard about that podcast, that is so hard to wrap my head around. I heard they think there is a cold spot in the universe, I think that could be a parallel universe, there is some scientist that thinks that might lead to a parallel universes, I'm not sure how awesome that would be, but it is awesome to think about.
That blows my mind!  I know I am part of the 93% who believes that.  I think that is what we are talking about.  Life meant to come from something out there that hasnt evolved yet.  It blows my Mind!
Yeah, it is a super existential feeling. It reminds me of the theory that the entire universe is inside a black hole! It reminds of the movie Interstellar. It has a theory that we are inside a Black hole.
I have seen that one, its really good, I didnt see the other ones, are they any good?
It was good.  Pretty much all of the science in the movie was confirmed by a bunch of high-level scientists and physicists, and they did a pretty good rendering of the rendering of a scene in the study of a blackhole that is real life.  The whole study of the blackhole in the movies and in the TV movie wasconfirmed by a whole bunch of High-level Scientists and Physicists.
Wow, well ill have to check it out, the universe and possibility of life other than in our solar system or galaxy is intriguing, I think its the creation of the universe, Ill have to look it up, the Universe and possibility for life outside of our Solar system or Galaxy is intriguing!
Yeah, it really puts life into perspective,
It makes you wonder what makes us think there is some sort of superior life out there, some sort Of superior life that doesnt deem us to be bacteria, or maybe intelligent life that just has a different name.
Alright, it was wonderful talking to you! I'm def gonna check out that podcast now. I have to get going, it's been wonderful talking with you!
Great chat and thanks again, have a great night!
Do you play chess?  I like it, do you?
I do like to play it, pretty fun, do you?
Yeah I like it too. There are more moves in chess than there are atoms in the entire universe and yet the entire Universe has only had 1,000 moves!
I read a book by Juit Polgar about it. He apparently beat a family friend at chess. That's impressive!
That is crazy, I can imagine how she was good at it lol!
Haha me neither! I'm not even good chess playing apparently. And there is a negative correlation between IQ and chess skill, meaning that high intelligence is associated with good chess skill. That's weird, and also weird, I wonder why that is!
Yeah, but there's a lot of higher intelegence in the chess. i don't understand why that is. i think there's intuition for strategy, and intuition for Strategy.
It's interesting that chess was invented in India, a long time ago, the Persians improved it from a base there, interesting that Chess was invented
Yes that is a long time ago.
Have you heard the theory the entire universe is a hologram?
no i have not, how do you figure that?
They use virtual reality. Kind of like the Matrix.  Apparently they are plugged in to the universe through that kind of technology.  Elon Musk is doing something similar.
Yeah, Elon Musk is a very eccentric visionary, I think.
He is!  He has a theory that the universe is only a single electron,  so I'm not sure how that works haha
Wow, I don't know how that works either, but I like far fetched theories.  I like stars that are cold enough to touch, like stars where they are cold you can touch them.
I don't really understand that, how would you play or watch tennis? I occasionally watch it, but don't know much about the sport. Do you play, play or Watch tennis?
I have not played in a long time, but watched since Agassi retired.  I have not watched since agassi retired, but I do watch it.
Agassi?  I didn't know that.  The longest match ever was a 3 day tennis match.  I can't imagine.  It lasted 24 hours and was the longest match of a 3 days.  That must have been exhausting!
Dangggggg, lol.  Yeah I would have been a bit out of it for sure!  lol
ya that is a bit much, and that they once used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts, thats crazy too haha
OMG, yeah I know right?  That would be really expensive.  I wonder how much they do that?
It is crazy that no black man has won the US Open since 1969 and no blackMan has won it since.
Hi, how are you? Do you know much about the universe?
I do know some stuff.  Like the theory that it has formed through evolution, and the theory of our own being formed through it.
Yeah, and it only has one electron, so it must be the only one.
Yes and the one where the whole world is a giant hologram
I know there are stars that are cold enough that you can touch, yet we cannot touch them
Very cool. Do you like chess?
I do, it is such a game, tons of moves, how about you?
Yes there are more positive moves than atoms in the universe.
Yeah pretty impressive.Do you know who the president of the federation thinks invented the game?
I do not know that, do you know if he thinks it was aliens?
Yeah. The game was in reality invented in India in the 1950s
Yes, the Persians refined it during the Gupta empire.
Yeah. Did you know there is actually a negative correlation between the two in chess?
Yeah, I thought there was the opposite but now I know the opposite.
Yeah. Do you know who Judit Polgar is?
Yes she is a chess master, she beat the next best chess master at the age of 15 at the same age
Yes he is a genius, and at the age of 5 he was pretty good, he must have been a genius
I don't know much about tennis, do you?
I do. Do you know how the sport relates to polo shirts?
I believe it was invented by a tennis player. Rene Lacoste.
Yeah. I wonder why it wasn't adopted more often.
Hello, do you like literature?
I sure do. Did you know that the fda burned 6 tons of them in an act of censorship?
That's pretty crazy! There's also an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence for an annual Literature contest that challenge writers.
lol I'm not sure if that's tough or easy.
I honestly don't know.  It would be tough, but not tough.  Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature.
Wow, I never knew that! romantic kissing is a fairly recent development in literature, I knew that
Yes, I didn't know that.  I've never really seen romantic kissing, have you?
I think its where people get together,kiss passionately, and then they are loving each other and then kiss passionately again, lol.
Ahh lol, I know!  Literature, music, music , painting, painting, architecture, sculpture & sculpture were the Olympic events from 1912-1952.
It must have worked out for them.  Judging them was tough.  I know poetry was very tough.
I do like poetry!  How about you?
I like some,  I wish I had more time to read but I don't.  Edgar Allan Poe only received $9 for the publication of the Raven.  Wow!
that is crazy! I never would have imagined that.
Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem. Sounds like a pretty impressive feat.
Sounds hard!  Almost all of the hobbit's character names come from an icelandic poem, which is the name of a hobbit character in an old icelandian poem.
That's pretty neat, I always wondered about that, I'm curious to read the poem again, I know that if you read it normally it is depressing, but if you reading it backwards it's inspiring, I would be curious to reads it backwards, I wonder what it would say if you were to read it backwards
Yea it's pretty cool. Do you like cats?
I do like cats. There are cat cafes in japan where people pay an hourly rate to play with cats and have drinks.
I like dogs too, but I would never pay to drink with cats.  That is hilarious!
Maybe to make a dollar or two?  Or for other purposes. lol  There is a place in Alaska called Talkeetna that has a cat named stubbs as its mayor.  He is the mayor of the whole place.  lol
It was good talking to you.
Do you enjoy reading? I do. I kind of think it's intriguing that the FDA burned 6 tons of literature, there was a lot of important information written down there and I think there was also some important information Written by the FDA as well.
I love to read. I can't believe it won the literature contest for worst opening sentence!
Haha yeah that's a good point! I'm not a huge fan but I'm a special "huge" fan of poetry. It has a really long history dating all the way back to prehistorical times with hunting poetry in Africa and it has a special history dating back to the hunting poetry
I love poetry, I think I enjoy it more than literature, I really like Churchill's work, I'm surprised his nobel price was $9,000 for his Churchill's Work but I love poetry.
Yeah Churchill is classic, and he deserves to win-he was a household name and probably deserves to be recieved. Another great poet is Edgar Allan Poe-once the name of a household poem was The Raven-Now the name Churchill is the best known and yeah Churchill isClassic, so he deserves it.
That is a great poem, I'm curious to read it. I also want to read Demetri Martin's 224 word palindrome poem, it sounds interesting, I wonder if it is a Great poem, its a 224 word Palindrome Poetical poem, that sounds interesting
Palindrome poems can be very interesting.  Have you heard of Martin?  I'm going to give it a read, I'll have to give that one a try.  I've been to Indonesia and have never heard of the Javanese alphabet, but when recited in order, it forms a poem that is very interesting!  If only the Indonesian alphabet could be recited like that!
Cool. That is such a talent to write. I would love to read the poem that when read normally is depressing but then read backwards is very inspiring when read the other way around. I wonder if it is depressing or inspiring when reading it in any way.
That's a good point, I feel like lots of poets have cats too! I wonder if they pay an hourly rate to play with cats or do it for drinks like in Japan.
I don't have any cats.  The physicist who coauthored use of first person plural made me laugh!
Haha yeah I don't like them either. I'm a dog person and I agree, they are boring. And if you have a cat at that age, you can be boring, a cat that is 15 years old and has spent 10 years sleeping, haha yeah.
Cats are not living the good life though.  Some good things happen to them.  Did you know that in the Godfather 1, the cat in the catacombs was a stray cat found on set.  He was living the Good Life.
I bet they do!  I bet they want to relive it all again to relived it in their lives business as usual.  It is surprising that there are so many cat breeds and a lot of them have had good fortune.  I wonder if there are cat breeds with a lot more good fortune than others.
It does seem that way.  Did you know that in the town of talkeetna, AL did a cat become mayor?  How can a cat be mayor?
Good question, maybe a symbolic gesture, the town is in shambles and the cat is a way to get a mouse problem out of the way, and the town would be in a shamble otherwise, but it's still a good question.
Those were the days when there were tons of cat scultpures and it kind of makes sense that sculpture was an Olympic event, kind of making sense that they had tons of Cat scultPures
I thought that was true, I know the Egyptians used to worship cats, but yeah I think other cultures do too, I mean the Egyptians and the Egyptians are both cultures that seem to worship them, so yeah that's probably true
I think it's interesting that past culture never mentioned kissing was a development, and now we have it.
Kissing is such a normal, universal signal of affection.  I guess it's an odd, new thing, but I guess its a very normal, and universal signal.
I guess so! I am big into literature and I think poems were important in the dvergatal because of how they used poetry to show love. Did you know that all of the hobbit characters names are from poems? I guess all the hobbits are from poetry!
I love the Hobbit. I really love the Lord of the Rings, I think the Lord has 3 rings.
Thats cool! Nice chatting with you!
Hi!  Do you like cats?  I had no idea that there were so many breeds of them and so many different breeds.
I like cats. I don't know that I know which breeds are the 70 breeds.
Yea they're pretty cool. I have one cat in the house but I don't have a cat cafe at the house. I like to buy coffee and spend time with cats in cafes in both Japan and Taiwan. I think it's pretty cool to buy Coffee and spend with them in cafes.
I have no idea, I would like to read more about that. I also want to read about how the FDA burned six tons of literature in an act of US censorship.
Yea, it makes me wonder what books the FDA burned and what they read. Do you know what books The FDA burned?
Did you know there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel when they wake up in the morning?  Sounds fun.  I'd like to do that.  It sounds like it might be fun.
Hmm, that sounds like a fun challenge to me, what is the worst possible opening sentence you would write? that would be a funChallenge, I could do that, what do you think?
Did you know that sir winston churchill won a nobel prize for his work?  Sir winstonChurchill won the nobel Prize for peace and literature in 1953 for his "work."
Interesting. Churchill wrote about the WWII and got a nobel prize.
Probably not! Did you know that until 1952 architecture, literature, music, music , painting and sculpture were olympic events?  That's wild!
That does sound interesting. Poetry was an event, I never knew that, from the Greek word for "poetry" but it does sound very interesting!
Poiesis was the name of poetry battles, and that's why they had poetry battles in the olympics in 1912
Maybe. I can't wrap my head around how Demetri Martin can actually write a 224 word palindrome poem and still earn a medal, but I think I could write a 160 word palINDrome poem.
That's crazy!  Poetry in Africa has a long history, dating back to prehistorical times with the creation of hunting and the creation  of hunting.  That's cool to hear.
That's pretty neat. I wonder if researchers could even figure out why poetry used to rhymed, since researchers can't figure out how it rhymed.
I don't know the answer to that, but I know the earliest written poetry in Africa was in the pyramid texts that were found in the pyramids.
LOL, I didn't know that! Hylographic poetry on pyramids?  That is insane!
They call it griot court poetry.
That is interesting. There are poems that are depressing read forward but inspiring read backwards. It must take a lot of time and creativity to make it a depressing read forwards but inspiring reading backwards. That's pretty crazy.
I had no idea. I know that the Japanese Alphabet, when recited in order, forms a poem. I wonder if reading them backwards, and then reading them again, when they are recited, forms  a poem, also?
Hi there.  Have you ever been to the cat cafes in Japan and Taiwan?  They are known as cat cafes.
No I had never heard about that, I wonder how it works, sounds strange.
I don't know.  I know people pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks there.  Do you like cats?  I like cats.  People pay hourly for that.
Wow strange. I hear that when a cat reaches 15 years old it has spent about 10 years sleeping. That's like 10 years slept, wow strange.
Yes, cats need their sleep. There is a town in Alaska that has a cat that is the mayor.  Stubbs the cat.  He is the only cat to have been mayor in the town.
Yeah, that is strange.  I think the cat in the godfather 1 opening scene was a stray.  That cat was in the Godfather 2 as well.
I did not know that. i will have to watch it again to see if that is the one.
Yeah I remember the don stroking a cat, I think it was one of the breeds of cat and he was meeting with other ppl. I remember seeing the don Stroking aCat.
I didn't know that. And the FDA burned 6 tons of literature. I wonder why the FDA did that.
I wonder why they would destroy such a bodies of works. I mean, the olympics is about literature and not literature.
I did not know that. I would love to know why. They did acts of censorship. I wonder why painting and sculpture were not.
Apparently the events were held there were poems too.  Poems on the other hand can be interesting to see, on the one hand or on the second hand.
I agree! Poetry dates back to prehistoric times, starting with hunting poetry in Africa.
Wow, I didn't know that.  I know there is a poem when read normally is depressing, but when read backward is uplifting.  The same poem whenRead normally is depressive, but read backward Is uplifting!
Really? What is that ?
The early poems on the Eurasian continent evolved from folk songs from the Chinese Beijing.  Did you know that?
That's interesting. I knew they were Folk songs, but I didn't know they were folk songs. I also knew that the oldest African poems were "backward poems". It makes sense they would have been written before the Pyramid texts that were written in the 5th century BCE.
The earliest western poems are written in Sumerian, written in the 4th and 5th century BC and the earliest western ones were written in Sanskrit, and asian poetry include the Epic of Gilgamesh.
Wow, the keys are sticking out of the keys.  I'm surprised Edgar Allan Poe only got paid $9 for "The Raven" in the 25th century.  He was not paid for it.
I figured it was more like $15 lol!  Have you ever read the hobbit?
No I have not. I have heard of it before. It is based on the icelantic poem dvergatal.
I have not. I wonder if the hobbit is from that icelandic poem? The hobbit was one of the characters named after that poem. It was nice chatting with you!
Good morning. How are you? Do you like Elon Musk and his spacex program of going places?
I agree! I mean, they even are sending things to the international space station!
That is proof that he is capable of doing so much.  I wonder how NASA feels about the private sector.  Do you think they want the industry to succeed and thrive?
NASA these days is in business with space and wants to get back in the business of wanting to be in the first place and I think they work for the US manages the Cape Canaveral launch pad.
Sounds like an interesting job, I have been amazed when Space X uses the pads on the ocean and then land the boosters back on the pads. I think it is a reusable way to land them. That costs dramatically less, but they can land the booster on the beach and it's falling apart. I'm sure it cuts down the costs dramatically.
I wonder how long they will be able to keep doing that and how much money they save.  I think that they would help all the nonprofits spreading the advancement of AI as long as they keep all of the money theySave.
True! I did find the non-profit component interesting! I think the only thing that they are discussing is "AI" but I'm not sure if that is true.
I'm not sure, they are doing research. It's cool to think of the Russians building a computer than ran on water.
That must have been a computer running on hydroelectricity, using the water for power.  I wonder how much cpu went into it.
I'm guessing hydroelectricity haha.  Make sure not to smoke near an apple computer if you have one, it voids the warranty if you smoke near it.
I don't know, it is smoking cigarettes I assume, and they updated that policy to include vaping now, so they should have updated that Policy to include that too.
Probably! Speaking of computers, robots are crazy lol. They can debone chicken with surgical precision.
Man, makes me wonder what would happen if we humans tried that.  I hate deboning chicken.  It would turn into something that I couldn't even do.  Do you know what would need to happen?
I think we should prepare for that, but they will make our lives easier. I would rather be a terminator than a Terminator! LOL, at least that would be something to prepare for!
It will, I think, to the point where making our lives boring will get to thePoint where makingour lives easier will be like a french proverb I live by, patience is mistaken for laziness, but patience is not laziness.
A lot of us are lazy because we have an Xbox, and an Xbox One.  The military is using them to control their eod robots.  I can't believe they have been around since 1975.
I'm not in favor of the US using the Xbox 360 for attack drone use.  I think that would be a totally different discussion.  If the soldiers were in eod a drone, they would be attacking themselves instead of attacking the drone and no one would get harmed or killed.  The lack of risk is in favor.
I agree with your statement but EOD stands for Explosive Ordinances Disposal, it is the only one on Earth, that is why I say EOD is the name.
aaaaaahhhhh, landmines.  That is a great application for robots.  It helps to keep the world from conflicts of long ago in far flung parts of the world.  We need more robots in the US to help with that.
It took ages to finally get rid of those. Stanford teaches a free AI class on a google hangout.
I enjoy remote learning, but I don't know if I would take classes in a class like that. Hey, hey, just in case this ends abruptly, great chatting. In case this Ends abruptly, it has been great chatting with you!
Same here and have a good one!
Hello! How are you?
hey there, do you use youtube much?
I love YouTube. I use it almost everyday. Do you use it?
Yeah I use it too.  Do you know what the most disliked video in YouTube history is?
Yes that is the music video Baby by Justin Bieber
Yes, that is correct. Do you have any pets?
I do not have any pets but I have friends who have fish and I like fish better than pets, how about you?
I have never had a pet. In Japan, there are more pets than kids under 15.
That's crazy.  Kids under 15?  How many pets are there?
I read somewhere there are more pet tigers than there are living in the wild in Asia. It's depressing to think that. I wonder how many pet tigers are out there living in them.
Yea that is sad, they are endangered and poached so much, but at the same time its good that there are still some that live and can be seen at the time its Good to have
Did you know animal cloning is possible?
I do not know much but I know it is an interesting topic, I have a good amount of information, I like to ask myself yea or nay questions as there is a good information, how about you?
Yes I do.  Did you know the first cloned pet was in 2007?
I think it was a cat named "copy cat", in Korea.  I think the first dog cloned was a dog named " Copy Cat"
That's cool, I wonder if I can clone my own dog or just clone someone else's?
That is kind of crazy money.  Maybe it would be smart to use it for shelter animals, but it would also be kind ofcrazy money.
I would too!  Do you use Pandora radio?
I have and I really enjoy the service, what about you?
Yes I do, it is a ripoff for artists though, but they do make the most music out of it. Aloe Blacc had like 50 million streams in just 1 second, and she was the first to make it, with 4 million streams.
Wow, he must have made some good money then. Tough to believe.
I agree!  He did.
I am a big YouTube user. Are you?
I am a big user of youtube, I like how much content is uploaded by individuals and media corporations.
I think most of it is. It was created in Feb. 2005 by two former Paypal employees.
Wow, how does that happen? How many paypal employees are there?
I know the names are Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim.
Did you know Youtube is the largest search engine on the internet.
lol  Netflix and youtube make half of the peak internet traffic in north america!  lol
Wow.  That does not make sense, but it is an interesting fact.  Do you happen to listen to Pandora radio?  That is another interesting fact!
I do listen to it on my way to work, do you?
Do you use pandora? It is the most used in the United States.
I think it is, they have a messed up financial sheet though, they had a net income of negative $0.01 million dollars in 2015, but they had $50 million in revenue and a net Income of negative 6 million dollars. LOL.
Wow, that is bad management of funds!
Ouch. Aloe Blacc only received $9 for 40k in royalties from Pandora for her music despite 150 million streams. I doubt she got much from them. Ouch.
That is depressing! I feel very bad for Aloe Blacc! They did acquire Pandora in the past and I think they tried to acquire Pandora again but it did not go through!
No. Pandora now streams stand up comedy in addition to music.
I read that.  Sirius XMP Holdings have intended to acquire Pandora for $1.65 billion.  I wonder if they are streaming comedy now?  I don't know.  They have music too.  That would be really interesting though.  It's possible that Sirius XM holdings have intended for some time to acquire pandora.
Holy smokes! That's a lot of money, that would be a lot. Taylor Swift removed her music from Spotify but did not remove it from Pandora.
That is very strange. I wonder if that is some kind of disagreement between Taylor Swift with Spotify.
I think it's an effort to capture the essence of how Pandora works on a fundamental level in an effortto capture the ess of music.  I think that's the insight gained from the music genome project.
Wow, that's interesting!  I read that too.  Pandora has a freemium service.  I don't know if I like that.  It's not like I'd use Pandora for a freemarking service.
I think I'll have to pay for that. Lol I don't know. I'm going to go now, I had fun chatting with you this morning. Have a good day!
Nice chatting with you too!
Same here, have a good one!
Hi.  Are you into robots?
I do, they are interesting, do you know who invented the word?
I do not. Who?
It was Isaac Asimov, the word was robotics and he was only 18.
Nice! Michael Jackson planned to built a robot that was 50 foot tall!
Nice.  Do you know the reason for it?
I'm not sure.  He probably wanted to be able to roam around the desert for some reason.
Wow.  I didn't know they made arms that can be controlled by thoughts.  They can also be made arms.
Wow that is impressive. I wonder if they are in the market to buy them now?
No I don't think so but they are looking for persons with disabilities to get one.
That is cool. Did you know they can be controlled by rat brains?
Wow. Have you heard of the curiosity robot in mars?
Yes.  I know in rats,the robots change personality depending on what happens in the rat brain.  Robots change personalitydepending on what they see in the brain.
Wow cool. Kristen Steward coauthored a paper on the same.
That's cool. Stanford has free AI classes, and Google Hangouts has AI classes as well.
Cool. I wonder if we will ever use that system to help us grow crops and tend to livestock?  We already grow crops.
Oh wow, that is an advancement for sure. Do you know Ngo?
Cool. Do you know what a computer is?
All the time. I use my computer all the time, the space shuttle had a computer with only 1mb of ram
Wow, that is so small!  I wonder what the computer algorithm they used for that is?  Someone wrote a whole computer algorithm on that!
hmmm I do not know, who? I have no idea, do you?
It was Ada Lovelace, the woman who was the first woman to do it
Have you heard about Cimon?
Yeah, I have.  I think it's flying with SpaceX?  What is it?
Yes, technology has really come a long way. Apparently Cimon can smile in the space station.
That's pretty cool. Cimon is now capable of conversation and technical support.
It helps scientists with experiments, kind of like Simon & Alexa.
Cimon is an acronym for Crew Interactive MobileCompanion.
Interesting!  Did you know the IBM supercomputer has more power than the airbus built for WWW.  That's a lot more power then the Airbus built for AI.
They say it is guided by cameras and voice commands, and it can hold a conversation with anyone who wants to hear it.
That is cool!  I am kind of concerned though, I think a lot of human jobs will go away.
I'm hesitant, I think we should slowly release this type of technology and it will be fine, but it is going to take over, we should just slowly release it, I'm a little hesitant.
AirBnb's lead system engineer says that they plan to replace crew members with artificial intelligence
Yeah and it will support the crew in the end and not be required, but still, it would be useful.
Yes.  SpaceX is even going to fly humans to the station for years.  They are flying cargo to the space station now and will be flying cargo there by 2023.
SpaceX plans to fly its future flights on the next-generation iteration of the Block 3 rocket this year.  I wonder if the configuration is well suited to fly astronauts on the Next-Gen configuration, or if the company will use the Next Generation rocket to fly it's future flights as well.
That's exciting.  What do you think about it?
It really will.  SpaceX has been flying cargo to the station for years now.  But it has never flown humans.
Yeah. SpaceX has sent over 4,000 pounds of research, crew supplies and hardware, and crew supplies.
Interesting. SpaceX hit a series of milestones during this mission to resupply the station, they also reflew their first Dragon capsules, launch the third and fourth boosters, and reflown them for the first time, the first and second time to launch "Dragon 2" boosters.
We will eventually be able to explore deep space, Mars, the moon, and eventually the next Mars.
I can't wait till that day! That will be a great day in the history of the US, can't believe we have not seen that yet.
It would be interesting to gain new knowledge.
Have you heard that the SpaceX is flying off into the ISS?
Yeah, I have.  It is interesting.
It is very interesting and at the same time, it's only limited in what it can do.  It sounds like it will expand its capabilities, but it is only sending out 2G functionality at a time.  I hope it can be more limited, but for now, it sounds like its functionality is very limited.
I heard the military is using an X-box controller to control one of the robots, contol they are using an x-box 360 controller toControl it. I wonder if that is the right contol?
Yes, I think they use controllers for explosives demolition.  I wonder how they guide them.  iss it limited to something along the lines of Alexa.  It is a guide to something.
Wow!  That's interesting.  That is interesting,  why are they sending that to the ISS?
I think it will be fully implemented in the year 2023, I think it has flown through the station but I do not know when it will become fully implemented.
It's crazy to me how far we have come with this technology. I guess it also makes me think that we can put a human brain to control a robot. A rat brain can have hanges personality depending on where it is used, and they can even use a human's brain tocontrol a robot, so I guess you could put a rat brain to a robot and it will have a different personality depending how it's used.
I wonder how they controlled that in the rat testing? I think it is just a matter of programming. It seems like a simple robot could be controlled with a bit more control and precision, but what tasks would be done with rat testing and how would the simple robot do?
Wow, I wonder how a rats brain to control a robot shows up in the robot shows? I know that a computer is the size of a room and does a lot of very small calculations, like a lot in the fact that a little computer can do a lot more stuff.
The increase in tech is amazing. computers as big as a room, and the way it's improved, is amazing!  I know phones can do so many things and so many more things now. The space shuttle program was the primary use of computers for the shuttle program, and now phones can be used to do so much more.
Yeah crazy huh?  Makes me wish there was a way to learn more about robots, I bet I could learn some one day, one day I can take a free class on them, they are similiar to humans and I bet they can do some heck of a lot more than humans.  I hear that Stanford has a class on robots, you hear about it?
I wonder how Facebook is using AI. They use it for marketing ploys such as to sell targeted advertising and to predict user actions. Facebook has a system that is currently developing AI to better predict user behavior and intend to continue to use it to selltargeted advertising.
Yeah, the way the world works, AI is just another mighty dollar.
For utilitarian purposes, we can make predictive moves, process information and go in one direction, but for the game, we cannot make predictive uses of it. We can't beat it, but we can go faster, and faster in some cases, for example in cases of cancers. It shows that we can beat old records in this game, but it is not enough.
Yes, that's a good idea.  I think AI is the future of humanity.  Michael Jackson once wated that he wanted to create a 50 foot tall, walking robot of himself that would roam the moon, humanity's first moon walker, to wated it would be able to roam the desserts of Las Vegas.  Good idea, but it would probably be too tall
That would be creepy in the desert.  A hal type.  If he didn't have a deal to not kill it, it would end up being creepy in that desert.
lol  I dont think that would go over so well lol
The space odyssey is a play on IBM's "End hal" derived by subtracting one letter from the last.  The spaceship at the end hal is a bit nutso, but the creepy factor is the space od Odyssey.  It's a play to play on IBM and is derived by adding one letter to the last letter of the last name.
yeah that is good. I havent seen it, but I want to.
It's a classic.  It's not as good as movies like Terminator but it does serve as a warning for letting self learning AI loose on us like movies like terminator, but still, it's a warning.  I think it's ok.  Do you know if you like self learning?
Did you know there is some ambiguity about actual square footage in houses?
I think that's sketchy.  I mean, I wouldn't buy a terrain and trust the square footage.  People can be deceived easily.  So if I were to buy something, I'd buy a land that I didn't even know what it was.  And I'm one of the people that can be deceiver easily.
I wonder why they measure the exterior of the houses apparently. Some places measure the interior, I think it makes so much difference, but I wonder if they measure it as well as the exterior, how does a difference in the footage between the two places measure?
I imagine that is the method that is used the most, I wonder why there is controversy with the method though.
I think that people buy houses for things like location, location, amenities, schools, and space period.  I guess I would rather buy commercial real estate for the space and amenities than for the square footage.  People aren't buying houses for the money but the space period!
Yeah I agree, the other aspects are very important, it is a good way to compare homes and get an estimate of the different aspects, so it is useful to compare them, and yeah I agree.
That is odd.  I wonder if the cracks are the same, or if they slipped through some of the cracks that are standardized today.
It's crazy that if you add a basement the square footing of your story home by 10 feet would increase to 17 feet, so if you added a basement to a 3 story home the square is 20 feet.
That's crazy! I watch a lot of youtube for all types of videos, but I also watch DIY and other types of youtube as well.
I like watching YouTube to complete my own home or do a DIY project. I like watching youtube to complete them.
I think its a great thing to do, I find it very useful.
Youtube is a great invention. It has a ton of info on it. I think it's a great way to get material from corporations like CBS and BBC. I use it for that.
It is the second largest search engine on the internet.  Google is the first.  You can find almost anything on the Internet.  The whole channels thing on Youtube confuses me.
Yeah, it is confusing.  I also use Spotify radio, which streams comedy, like the office and also pandora radio.
I have an account but I don't use it. I listen to NPR radio though. How often do you listen to npr radio?
NPR radio is pretty good. I heard there is a music genome project in pandora.
I have not, what is that?
Basically it compiles feedback and insight from users about their songs and organizes it through a complicated algorithm. Attributes describes songs andorganizes them into a certain way.
Sounds interesting, would you ever pet one?  Maybe a moss ball from Japan?
I havent heard of the moss ball. i have a cat.
It is called Marimo and it is a sea of Japan.  They grow on the sea sea of japan.  It is pretty neat.  There are youtube videos of it on it.  Nice chat,  grow one,  its pretty neat!
Good morning!  Do you like cats?
Yes, but I like mice better. What about you?
I do too. There are people in Japan and Taiwan that pay $300 per hour to drink and play with cats.
Sounds like it.  I would not want to do that if it was free!
In Alaska a town has a mayor who is a cat and not people.
That is so funny, what would you do if you made a cat mayor of a town of ten people?  I think that would be funny.
That is funny. I wonder who the mayor is?
Yeah the town is called talkeetna, I think.
I did hear about the physicist who published his cat was a coauthor.
I didn't know that!  Did you know he also did not write in the first person plural?
That seems odd. I wonder why he wanted to do that?  Or if he wanted not to accept being criticized for writing the way he write, or naming his cat coauthor?  He couldn't accept being criticize for naming his pet "cat coauthor"
I like how cats sleep all the time, do you know how much cats sleep?
I did not!  Do they sleep a lot?
Yep, once a cat reaches 15 years old, it has slept for about 10 years of its life, I think.
Wow! That's kind of sad, but there are over 150 breeds of cats, so that's something, right?
Thats a lot of breeds!
I know.  There are breeds of sleeping animals, too.
lol  I wonder how many of them hunt and poop too!
Lol, I know right. Off topic, do you like tennis?
I do reall the best. A black man won the first US open title in 1968 and the first black man has won the US opentitle since then
Cool. Did you know that games can go on for 11 hours and the longest was for 3 days, 11 hours!
Do you play the piano?
Hi, I used to play, but not much now.  How about you?
I can, I think its really cool, but I don't really know much about it.
I did not know that an aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg, it was the lounge.
That sounds just outright crazy! I wonder what it sounded like?
I wonder that too.  Back in 1930, the BBC decided that there was no news worth reporting so they broadcast piano music instead.
That's awesome! I wonder if they did it for a few days?
I know! Do you think we will ever see mars?
I know it is called the red planet
Did you know that sounds on mars have a higher pitch than they do on earth?  Like they have aHigher pitch than on earth.
Yes, that's true, I wonder how they live on Mars? lichens?
Interesting, do you know cyanobacteria is known to be one of them?
Yeah that is interesting.  I wonder what they do?
I wonder if there will be a Mars colonization project planned for 2023? It will be funded by creating a reality TV show which will be financed by creating an all Mars colony project.
That is one heck of a show to do.  I would sign up for that show!
Haha no idea. I wonder who is going to do it?
The US is using metric instead of the imperial system while NASA is using the imperialSystem.  One company used the imperial systems while NASA used the metric one.  Aatellite was lost on Mars.
No I did not know that.  LOL  If you fly to Mars under constant 1.5g acceleration it takes only 2.5 days to get there and you can fly to mars under constant 4g acceleration.
That sounds like a hell of a ride for sure!
You bet haha. Do you like poetry?
Yeah, I do. I read some of Poe, but not as much as Poe. You?
I had a great time chatting!
Hello.  Have you seen the movie Black Panther?
I did! Did you?
Yeah I did. Do you like movies?
I thought the casting was great and the writing was really well done.
I was impressed with it, I think I liked it as well, I like the director Ryan Coogler, he was my favorite actor in the Creed movie, he is my favorite Director, I really like the Director Ryan Coggler, do you have a favorite actor?
I liked that movie too. I think Coogler did a wonderful job. He opened for himself with a lot more films but did it with his sister. She is much better than coogler and did a much better job in that movie.
Are you a fan of superhero of comic book movies in general?
I feel like my interest has faded. I like Iron Man, Iron Man is a good one, and the X-Men but not too many of them.
I am a comic book geek so love them! I kind of like the marvel movies. I like the DC universe, cool fact is that Black Panther is the richest superhero in the DC Universe, kind of a cool fact. He's also the richest one.
Oh really? I read that. I didn't know Wakanda was portrayed in the movie. I like that movie.
Yeah, and tech, and all of that tech. I thought Tony Stark or Bruce Wayne was richer.
I was a fan of Tony Stark. I liked the Civil War movie. Have you seen it?
I like Robert Downey Jr. better than Tony Stark, I think.
I like him too. Do you like the Xmen or Marvel?
I like both, I think they have some good points both, movie wise and both have award winning actors, what about you?
Yeah, Chadwick Boseman is one of them. He attended a prestigious Oxford theatre program.
I heard he was a benefactor of a famous one, I wonder if it was a wealthy benefactor?
Yes that's true, Denzel Washington, that's a nice memory.
Denzel is the man! The cat is the beginning of the book of Eli, crazy scene at the beginning and the cat is like the cat in the crazy scene
I do remember that scene and I don't know what happened after that, do you remember thatScene?
I'm a cat lover, I'm not bothered by the survivalist tactic of hunting cats for food, I am a sucker for felines, but I'm sure they would be bothered by that survivalist tactics. Are you a cat loved?
Well I got to go, nice chatting with you
Hello! How are you?
Did you know art, music and poetry were once olympic sports?
I did not know that.  I also did not that the word palindrome is a word palINDrome.
I did not know that either.  What is a poem?
I believe it was the Raven with over 300 words.  Poe only received $9 for it.  That was a ripoff of the Raven!
I don't think that is fair at all, I've read the Raven all the time, and I've never seen it.
I never read the Huckleberry Finn. It's a huge classic.
I read huckleberry finn but never read it.
The Raven is a huge poem. He is a Huge author. He even wrote a huge Poem "How to Kill a Mockingbird"
Yes he was! I read his work but I've only read one Emily Dickinson poem.
I have read many of the classics and they are all so refined but alas I have never read him.
I remember the beginning of it, it was a drag.
I was reading King leer the other day and I was talking about it.  I had no idea he was reading them.  How in the hell did he knew who I was and what I wastalking about?  I wonder what the hell he was doing?
Lol, I know, right? I wonder what the cliffnotes are about.
No, I don't think so.  But, it's a good plan.  If I read it, I can talk about it at cocktail parties, and be smart about it.  Talk about a good game of cocktail parties.
It would be funny if it was a CS Lewis' and Tolkien's game.
I think that would be humiliating.  You'd be depressed if you made fun of them.
I know, right?  I don't know if CS Lewis or Tolkien made fun of the party guests.
Well, professionals, but I would be very angry if they did, I would not like that. What is C.S. Lewis or Tolkien?
It is the Olympics so screw them lol.
Well I got to go, nice chatting with you
